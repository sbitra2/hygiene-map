Really?).\n\nWeekday lunch: Service is friendly, but slow - there was only one person in charge of doing everything and it took longer than expected despite there only being 3 customers total. The owner likes to talk to people, no problem with that.\n\nThe $3.99 beef wrap is a good deal for its size. It was smaller than average and greasy, but definitely good value for the amount paid. Confusingly, veggie and chicken wraps are more expensive ($4.49 and $4.99 respectively - a veggie wrap more expensive than beef wrap!?)\n\nOverall, 4 stars for good value after considering cost. Food had more taste than the more expensive Shawerma Plus ($8.69 incl. fries + drink) nearby, but was definitely smaller, greasier and unhealthier.... \n\nNo posted menu, only the delivery menus so it is confusing when you first walk in where to order from.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 2}}], "state": "ON", "stars": 4.0, "latitude": 43.4750114}]}}
