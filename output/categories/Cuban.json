Finally, we found this place and decided to go in for lunch. The place is small, but nice, well-decorated and clean, with a full bar and a small stage for live music. The guy who waited on us (and I believe, cooked our food) was very friendly and welcoming. And our sandwiches were excellent, exactly what we were craving! So far, so good, right? Indeed. 4 stars, in fact. I'm taking that 4th star back, though, because of the fact that they only allow you to have fries as a side. The rice and beans have always been a huge draw for my wife (and many other people) at other Cuban restaurants, and was what she wanted for her sides, but they wouldn't allow it. We offered to pay the difference, but when he told us it would be $6 extra, even without the fries, she decided against it. That would be $16 (pre tax & tip) for a sandwich, some rice and beans (no drink). That may not be outrageous, but it is definitely too damn much, no matter how good the sandwich may have been. In fact, as odd as it sounds, you can only get rice & beans one of two ways: order one of their 6 or 7 entrees (not sandwiches) or pay the additional $6. I don't understand why a Cuban restaurant would want to make a major Cuban staple so difficult for customers to eat. It's like a southern restaurant trying to charge almost double to get mashed potatoes with your meatloaf. It just doesn't make any sense to me.

Once inside, there are only six small tables. The red tablecloths, glass dessert counter, tiled floors, and bright natural lighting coming through the doors nicely accentuated the d\u00e9cor. Fellow Yelper Kurdy S and I were the only non-Spanish speaking customers during this afternoon. Like many of the nearby restaurants, the atmosphere was fitting as a casual lunch spot.\n\nFor appetizer, we shared the Tostones Rellenos de Roja Villeja ($4.49). The plate came with four fried green plantains holding a small scoop of tender shredded beef on top. The plantains had great texture on the outside to add to the soft green banana flavor on the inside. The beef was tender, flavorful, complex, and very nicely seasoned. I can eat these all day long.\n\nWe also had a side order of Plantanos Maduro Fritos ($2.49) that came with soft bananas served piping hot, perfectly fried, and sweet. It was nicely glazed, but also unexpectedly oily. \n\nNext, the Cuban Sandwich ($6.95) came with shredded beef, ham, and mustard. The bread had an awesome crunch with an excellent secondary chew. The sandwich was big enough to share and the dish also came with French fries. The way they kept it simple without all the fillers made this one of the best Cuban Sandwiches I've had so far.\n\nFinally, the Filete a la Plancha ($9.99) came with a big serving of grilled sole, black bean rice, and salad. The sole was fresh, moist, tender, and had good flavor but slightly over salted. The black bean rice had great flavor and moisture--much better than the one at Victor's 1959 Caf\u00e9. The lightly dressed salad provided a nice change of pace to the sole.\n\nAntithetical to the cuisine's longstanding stereotype of being bland, this place simply rocks. Service however, was friendly but also inattentive, offbeat, and at times awkward. For instance, the food and bill took forever to come, and our water was never refilled even though the restaurant was not busy.

It's then press-grilled and served with mariquitas (fried thin green plaintains) or french fries.  It also comes with a garlic lime dipping sauce.  Don't be foolish and get french fries now, go for the plaintains for sure!  \n\nThus far, our experience at Havana Grill was garnishing a 4 star and I was excited about our entrees.  \n\nThe BF had their Boliche Mechado ($14.95), which is slow-cooked roasted eye of the beef round, stuffed with chorizo (Spanish sausage).  It's served with white rice, black or red beans, or moros.  He had them with moros.  The dish was luke-warm and lacked flavor.  If anything, it had an odd plastic wrap aftertaste that didn't fare well.  Same with the moros.  The BF ended up dousing the whole thing with hot sauce.

There are also onions that are mixed into this dish.  I had this with white rice and red beans.  Although my pork was also luke-warm, it was tender and not dry at all.  It had a lot more flavor that the other dish, although my red beans need some kick as well.\n\nOverall, we were more impressed with our Cuban sandwich than our entrees.  Service was okay.

It is a bit of a haul for us considering that its sister restaurant, Florida Cafe, is located less than ten minutes from our house, but the food at Havana Grill is a lot better for some reason and therefore worth the drive. Though the service isn't super speedy, you are perfectly occupied with slices of buttered and grilled cuban bread you will need to restrain yourself from finishing. After limiting myself to one piece (ok, one and a half), I had my favorite dish, the ensalada playera ($10 for lunch), which I was glad to see served on a regular plate rather than the ridiculous and impractical shell-shaped bowl it previously was served in. This salad contains small succulent shrimp, ripe avocado, baby tomatoes, roasted red bell peppers, and sliced red onion atop a bed of beautifully assembled mixed field greens, and is served with a mojo dressing that is wonderfully pungent with lemon and garlic. It reminds me of a salad you can get at a good cafe in California where fresh and healthful ingredients parallel intense flavor and a sense of hearty satisfaction. I have no complaints whatsoever about the salad because it is exactly the kind of food I like to enjoy. If you are looking for something a bit more filling without feeling stuffed, however, you should get what my husband got, the pollo alla plancha ($10 for lunch). This is a thinly pounded chicken breast grilled to perfection and served with sauteed onions. The onions could definitely be sauteed longer to get some nice caramelization, but the chicken is great and the accompanying 'moros y cristianos' (black beans and white rice) are to die for! The flavors of the latter meld together with bits of tender pork to create a Cuban staple you'll want to eat over and over again.\n\nAnother item we usually get is the Cuban sandwich. In case you've never had one, a Cuban sandwich consists of sliced ham, roast pork, pickles, and swiss cheese pressed on a white Cuban bread loaf spread with mustard until it is warm and melty. The version here is well-executed and tasty, and, although I've had better in New York, we haven't found another in town that compares. They offer it in a half size as well, which would be enough for an appetizer for two or a small meal.\n\nAlthough the food prices here are fairly reasonable for what you get (dinner gets more expensive), drink prices are absolutely not. Even the Strip can't get away with charging $6 for a Miller Lite, unless perhaps you are at one of the best restaurants, and they generally don't even serve Miller Lite. Even worse, the beer at Havana Grill doesn't come to the table icy cold. Perhaps they are trying to give you a taste for authentic Cuban refrigeration temperatures, but at these prices I want refrigeration you can expect at a Ritz Carlton (or any decent bar).

First of all, I've been primed for a good Cuban sandwich for at least a year. I've seen them on Anthony Bourdain's shows and Andrew Zimmern's, and they look juicy and scrumptious. I guess those were the made-for-TV versions, because the one I got here wasn't much different from something I could have gotten from a deli.  \n\nI've since looked up \"Cuban sandwich\" online and the Havana Grill's offering looks pretty much the same as the images I find on Google.  Damn you, travel shows, for raising my expectations!   Honestly, if someone had handed me one of these at work or something, the most I would have thought was, well, the bread is interesting. Not a bad sandwich, but nothing memorable. \n\nMy friend had fries with her sandwich and they were basic fries.  I had the fried plantains and liked them: crisp, not too thick, and not oversalted.  \n\nTwo friends ordered the ropa vieja- one had chicken and the other tried pork. They were kind enough to give me a taste, and I must say, the sauce for these dishes was delicious! It came with beans and rice, and those beans were very tasty as well. \n\nI forgot to mention the appetizers: we tried papas rellenas and tostones.  The papas (sort of like fried balls of mashed potatoes with a small filling of meat) were interesting  but I thought the flavor was just kind of \"meh\"- again, not memorable. I was not fond of the tostones- the fried green plantains. In fact, none of us ate much of those.  For me, they just had very little flavor.  One thing we gobbled up, though, was the buttered bread!  Very good bread. \n\nAs for beverages, one of us tried the mojito and gave it a big thumbs up.  Another tried the raspberry margarita and although she can put away a drink, she didn't finish this one.  (She was also surprised that it came with salt on the rim rather than sugar. I don't know about such things, since I'm not much of a drinker).\n\nThe restaurant had a spacious, open feel  because the tables aren't crowded together. The tropical-themed leaf ceiling fans were kind of nice, too.  Simple, non-fussy wood tables and chairs add a casual flair.   \n\nOH - I have to add that service was V E R Y  S  L O W.  The servers (all good looking, - like GQ good looking)  took forever just to put the bread baskets on the table - even after we asked for it.  It took a long time to get our orders taken.  Upon check out, they mistakenly added a gratuity to the bill. Correcting the error took almost 20 minutes because of one or two other errors made during the correction of the first problem. Aggravating!\n\nAfter 9pm the loud music began, thanks to two DJs spinning (well, spinning hard drives, at least) some hearty Latin dance music. By 10 pm the dance floor was dark and the party was in full swing, with folks young and old doing all sorts of couples dancing. I picked up a few new songs thanks to Soundhound, and enjoyed watching people through the laser-lights.

I ordered the ceviche appetizer as my meal and was pleased with it. It wasn't the best I've had and it could have used more shrimp, but it was good nonetheless. You must also try their red sangria.

There seems to be something of theme developed along LVBS, with a Salvadorian and another Cuban restaurant in proximity to each other. This one is set in a bland storefront, but once inside the atmosphere feels more Havanian than anything else. The food is simple and spicy and delectable: hot crusty bread and butter, as mentioned in another review, spicy chorizo, steaming rice and beans, chicken that cleaves to the bone, yuca and plantains and pressed cuban sandwiches. The staff seems to be all Cuban, and prepare everything in big pots in the back kitchen. They treat you with genuine hospitality, and aren't particularly concerned with turning the table and running up the tab. Sit there as long as you like and peer through the dusty storefront windows at the sunburnt downtown avenues. It is probably impossible to stay or visit downtown, see the humble immigrant businesses and the few tawdry titty bars set along a background of near shantytowns, and not question how so much glamour and wealth could neighbor such impoverishment. \n\nIn any case, turning back to the Rincon interior you'll find one whole wall engulfed by an aging aerial photo of Havana. The picture displays the Malecon sea wall as it weaves along the waterfront. The water is that tepid blue that suggests a photograph from the sixties or seventies. We ate under its shadow and thoroughly enjoyed what might be characterized as a repast, under the watchful eye of our waitress, who bore a helpful smile our entire meal.

I have often urged my sister to help me start a catering business or better yet, help me open a Cuban cafe, but in San Francisco, CA., I am not sure it would take off, people in California are much more partial to Mexican food. \n\nWe did return the next day for lunch, my friend ordered the same thing she had the night before \"Camarones Enchilados\", which is sauteed prawns in tomato sauce, garlic, cumin, wine, onions and peppers served over white rice and black beans.

Until I stuck my fork into my chicken fricas\u00e9 (spoiler alert: when I get it at my local spot, the meat is falls-off-the-bone delish!), not only did it not budge off the bone, it tasted like it had been re-heated, and parts of it had the texture of jerky. Not a sign of freshness. Lord knows I've cooked and reheated enough leftover meals in my day to know what happens to chicken when reheated in the microwave. My mom's meal, though it was very tasty, the one bite I had was less than lukewarm.

The beef was moist and the tomato wine sauce was rich and a great compliment to the beef.  The chicken was also moist and well seasoned.

However, she messed up our order.  She insisted that she didn't.  Then, she insisted that what she brought to us in mistake was actually better than we wanted so we should keep it.  Then she went back to insisting that's what we ordered anyway.  The appetizer was more expensive than the one we wanted, there was no effort at all made to rectify the order mess up, and we were pretty much forced to eat what we didn't order (and pay for it).  But she was nice about it, annoyingly so.  I didn't want to argue at a birthday dinner, so I let it go, but she definitely lost some of her tip because of this.

After experiencing Cuban food in Miami I was ecstatic to see there was authentic Cuban food in Vegas that actually had good reviews. I was so excited to reminisce on my Cuban favorites. The place itself is VERY small. I would say 10 tables max. When we walked in, there was a table of 7 or 8 people and the empty tables were all missing chairs due to the shortage. Apparently this place isn't used to large parties. Thankfully there were 3 chairs left to make us a table. \n\nTheir menu isn't HUGE but has most of the Cuban staples. Ropa Vieja was a must for me. I could eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I even make it myself, however today was a day I would like to spend away from the kitchen.\n\nWe ordered the avocado salad and lamb chops to start. The avocado salad is basically just an avocado cut in slices and nicely arranged around a small cabbage and tomato salad. The avocados were tasty and soft but the salad in the middle lacked some flavor. I threw some salt on the avos and ate just them. The lamb chops (from what I heard) were very good. I don't eat lamb so I can't elaborate on this.\n\nFor entrees we ordered the ropa vieja (appetizer portion), a side of rice to sop up all the juicy goodness that comes with ropa (more on this later), a rack of lamb and the tasting platter, which consisted of ropa, a chicken dish and a pork dish. When the ropa came out, there was NO JUICE! :( I was disappointed to say the least. Every time I have made this or had this the beef was always swimming in that tasty juice. Because of this the ropa was pretty dry. The flavor was good but because of the lack of moisture I couldn't even eat it with the rice. The lamb chops (again from what I heard) were good. The spinach that comes with them, although good, had no real flavor. It needed some garlic or other flavoring. The tasting platter was good as well. The pork was fork tender, the chicken was spicy (just as my friend had ordered it), however she too stated the ropa was a little dry for her taste. \n\nFor dessert we ordered tres leches, flan and guava with cream cheese. The tres leches tasted like store bought pound cake that had been soaked in milk. The flan actually tasted more like tres leches than the real thing. I am not a flan fan because of its texture but this was a little stiffer and more like a cheesecake. The guava with cream cheese was swimming in a sweet sauce and not what I was used to. I am not familiar with the authentic presentation of this dish, however when I dined in little cuba in Tampa, it was always served as a slice of guava paste topped with cream cheese. This was more of a runny paste soaked in simple syrup topped with a line of cream cheese.\n\nAll in all the experience wasn't horrible, however I would not go back. They messed up on the bill and overcharged us, and then when it was corrected the total was still the same. I was not going to argue over $10 so we just ignored it.

The lechon was tender and juicy but I didn't get any of the garlic taste that the menu speaks of under that plate.  The pollo was very good and the sauce on it had a nice kick.  Far and away the best part of the plate was the ropa vieja.  This was juicy, tender, and very flavorful.  Along with the plate was a small salad and some rice and beans, the well known moros y cristianos.  There was a basked of cuban bread with the meal also.\n\nFor dessert, I had the guava shells with cream cheese.  I had iced tea and it was refilled promptly.  Service was very friendly.  A man and a woman were covering the tables and they worked well in tandem.\n\nI really enjoyed Cuba Cafe and will be back with my wife.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 7, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I've been coming here for years, and so happy for them that they moved into a bigger place- but still in the same shopping center.\n\nThe pollo and camarones al ajillo are AMAZING.

As one reviewer before me mentioned it was a work of art it was a light crisp crust with a very flavorful filling I could have just had a few of these for dinner.  \n-Tamal criollo homemade tamale the masa was a darker color with a bit more flavor then what I have had before it was good however it was a bit dry for my taste.\n-For dinner we followed other reviewers and tried theTasting plate a combo of Roos Vieja, rich spicy beef simmered with onions and peppers.  Pollo Tequila Mar chicken with herbs and a spicy tequila  sauce.  Lechon Asado marinaded pork in a garlic olive oil this was my favorite it reminded me of a well cooked turkey dinner!  Served with Moros Cristianos a black bean rice good but saved that for lunch because this is a TON of food.   Also served with Maduros ( a fried sweet plantain) \n\nAll in all the food was good the price was fair for the serving side the ambiance was nice.  It is a busy restaurant a constant flow of people on a Monday night!  The service was good the cooking was a bit on the slow side but like I said they were very busy so I won't fault them for that because they did bring our apps before dinner so we were fine chatting while waited. \n\nI am going back for a lunch of a cuban sandwich soon I can't wait to try that.

We ordered the fried plantains as our appetizer. My husband described them as \"Tasting like an onion ring on the outside and not-ripe-enough banana on the inside\". He was right. The plantains were not what I was hoping for. As for main dishes I got the bistec sandwich, which is a piece of flat steak pressed with tomato, lettuce, and little potatolings that are fried with a sauce of sorts. This was a pretty good sandwich, but I wish the steak had not been as chewy/sinewy as it was. My husband, who wasn't into the whole \"Cuban food\" idea ordered the chicken sandwich, which was basically exactly like my bistec.\n\nOur other side was french fries and they are nice a fat, crispy, none of them were soggy, actually quite enjoyable.\n\nOverall with the purple dining experience and the not-so-amazing food I have to go with 3 stars. The place isn't bad and maybe I should have ordered something else, perhaps the \"ropa\" meat dish everyone exclaims about, but I wasn't hungry enough for a full plate.

Yummy homemade Cuban food one mile from my house!!!\n\nMy BFF, a co-worker, and I headed over here for lunch. As the name would indicate, it's a buffet, but you can order anything off the buffet as a main dish and a few other standard items are available daily (Cuban sandwiches - didn't try these today, but they looked just like the ones that I sucked down in Miami, Plantainos Maduros - yummy caramelized plantains, Tostones - smashed plantains fried in to little fritters, and OMG good Flan).\n\nWe got there a little before noon and the place was full. The crowd was a mix of families and suit types. We were greeted by the friendliest of staff and headed off to the one free table. The menu and prices for the buffet vary by day and they are closed on Mondays. Take out is sold by the pound, so eating in is definitely the best bargain. As this was our first visit, we each decided to have the buffet to ensure we got to sample as much as possible.\n\nThe main buffet has around 14 items. We tried the following:\n*Pollo Frita (Fried Chicken) and Fricas\u00e9 de Pollo (Sauce Chicken) - both were juicy and tender.\n*Estofado de Res Al La Jaudinera (Pulled Pork with Vegetables in a Tomato Sauce)\n*Puerco Asado (Unbelievably good roasted Pork - tender and juicy with just the right amount of fat for flavor)\n*Yuca Root (served in large slices - tender and yummo)\n*Con Gris (Black Beans and Rice)\n*Frijol Colorado (Red Beans)\n\nIn addition they had two additional rices, menudo, pan (little rolls - these were the only things that were somewhat generic), and a soup (but we all thought it was way too hot out to try this one).\n\nThere are two smaller buffets - one with fresh fruits and a tossed salad, and one with deserts (which we didn't even get to because we were so full).\n\nWe added the Tostones (4 smashed plantains - fried in to little pancake like fritters) and Plantainos Maduros (caramelized plantains that we dusted with sugar - sending them right over the edge of gastric heaven). I think these were each $1.50 extra.\n\nEnded the meal with cubano coffee (mine con lech\u00e9) and flan (really some of the best that I have had - dense and creamy with just the perfect amount of caramel sauce). I think the coffees were $1.50 each and the flans were $3.00 (well worth the investment and the perfect ending to a wonderful meal).\n\nLunch ran about $16.00 for each of us, but we could have gotten out for under ten each if we had just stuck to the buffet. They have a decent selection of Cuban / Latin drinks, and coke products. And I'm pretty sure I saw someone with a Corona, so they must serve beer as well.\n\nThis place used to be a Pizza Hut and doesn't appear to have gone through much updating, so don't expect much in the form of atmosphere, but the food is really good - not fancy (more like you would get at someone's home), and is very clean. The wait staff is extraordinarily nice and as they knew we hadn't been there before, kept asking if everything was ok and if we had any questions.\n\nOne and a half hours after entering the place, we rolled ourselves back out in to the heat and vowed to be back soon! We were all so full that we would have been more comfortable if they had a wheel barrow service that could have ported us to the cars, but c'est la vie...\n\nSo if anyone out there is looking for a good alternative to Havana Caf\u00e9, please check this place out.

The buffet is small but comprehensive.  There are a couple different types of beans, a few offerings of rice, a soup, and many meat dishes.  Oh, before I forget, there are these amazing little fried wonders called croquettes (I think) and they were insanely good.  I have no idea what they are or what was in them, but I ate like 6 of them.  The beans were very tasty but the rice had been out too long (the place was empty when we got there).  The meat dishes however were really great.  The meat was all very tender and juicy.  I'm not really sure how Cuban food is prepared, but from what I discovered here, everything is slow roasted and delicious and full of deep, full bodied flavor.  The yucca is also really really good and something I had never tried before, kind of like tastier mashed potatoes.  To end our meal, I decided to put off my previous conceptions about flan and ordered what is considered The New Times best Flan in 2008.  It was good.  I was a little off put by the weird texture, but the sweetness kept pulling me in.  There is also a small salad and dessert buffet.

So we attacked the buffet looking to try a little of everything.\n\nThe item that stands out the most to me was the Yucca Root.  While it wasn't the best tasting thing on the tray, it was the most surprising thing.  I did not think it would be nearly as good as it was but it was amazing.  I even had a second helping.

I suspected it MUST be better than Havana Cafe (no offense to them, their food isn't bad).  I just know what homestyle Cuban cooking tastes like and that's what I was hoping to get.  Hopefully some ropa vieja, some black beans, some tostones... perhaps take home some croquetas. And of course, some Cuban bread which I'd been craving like a fiend for 2 weeks here. \n\nAlso, I'd heard it was a buffet. Pretty cool, I guess, so I could just get a little bit of this or that, and taste the rest of their dishes, in addition to what I wanted. \n\nWhen i got there, I walked in to find it was NOT a buffet anymore, but a full service sit-down restaurant. I walked in, and there were a few empty booths, but otherwise the place was pretty busy. Two servers walked by me several times, and I just stood there, unsure if I should just grab a table or if I had to wait to be seated. Finally one of the girls asks me if I have been helped (which i think she knew the answer, so the question was pretty unnecessary). \n\nOnce at my table, it took another long while to get one of them to come to my table. I want to say 15 minutes, but I'm guessing it was more like 5 and i was just so hungry that it felt like an eternity. I got my glass of water, which on a 114-degree day could have been a gallon of water and I still wouldn't have quenched my thirst. I placed my order, starting with the major stuff - ropa vieja with rice and black beans, and a side of tostones. Then I asked for some croquetas to go. \"Oh we don't have any more...\" What? it's barely 12 PM and you opened at 1130, and you don't have any croquetas left? What the F? I was so disappointed. She pointed to a large party in the center of the room and said they pretty much ordered all of them. F-ing greedy gluttons. Anyway, so then I ask her if they have Cuban bread. She says they don't make Cuban bread, but they have some little rolls they will bring out before my meal with some butter and garlic. Boo.\n\nA few mintues later, the little breads arrive. Nothing memorable, I could have done without them. But I ate them anyway. Did I mention I was starrrrrrving?\n\nAs I waited for my meal, I took some time to look around and take in the scenery. The other diners were a pretty eclectic mix, some obviously latinos, some obviously not, some hard to tell. But the place was packed. I found it odd that the waitresses would bring out a table's dishes one at a time, rather than on a tray wiht a little table, the way i've always seen it done at most cuban restaurnats. No wonder it takes forever to get some service. The huge party in the center of the room - wow... it took forever for everyone on the table to have a dish in front of them. And hten another table, one at a time. And then another... Jeez! no hustle whatsoever to get people their food... I guess if I'd been there with other people the long wait would not have felt so long, but I was sitting there by myself with nothing to do but observe and wait.\n\nFinally got my food. Let's see... Ropa vieja, REALLY good. Honestly I loved this part of my meal the best. Spiced just right, not too much tomato sauce or liquid, not overpowered by peppers and onions. Just the right blend. White rice, it was fine. Just white rice. I didn't eat much of it. Tostones - AWESOME. Crispy, not greasy, and not \"raw\" in the middle the way the thicker cut tostones are at some other restaurants. How did they know to make them just how I like them?! Damn. I wish there'd been more than three. And then there were the black beans. They were good. Just good. But then again, I am biased. My madrina holds the title for \"Best Frijoles Negros in the World\". But these were good. i'd eat them again.\n\nI didn't order dessert or a drink. After the disappointing croqueta/cuban bread news, I just wanted to eat my food and go. \n\nI did end up hanging out with one of the owner's daughters, and I learned they came to AZ via LA. She said she'd been to Miami once, but doesn't remember a lot about that trip. From our conversation, I gathered there was a bit of a disconnect between \"these\" Cubans and the Cubans from my hometown in terms of food. She didn't know what a frita is. So of course I got her email address and emailed her a couple of photos of a frita masterpiece from El Rey de Las Fritas.\n\nShe did reassure me that they normally don't run out of croquetas like this, but that if I ever want some of her mom's home made croquetas, i can call ahead and they'll hold them for me. She also makes pastelitos de guayaba. \n\nSo... the final word on Sabor Cubano. I liked the food I had. Wish they'd have a few things they don't seem to have (namely el Pan Cubano!) Come on, Phoenix!

The place looks and feels like \"Cuban food for the working class\", but it beats the other places hands down!  For one, all of the dishes we had (including our kids) were extremely hearty, rich, and flavorful.  None of this \"health-conscious\", lightened down for today's slim American type food here.\n\nEven the black beans were thick and pasty (but smooth).  The Papas Rellenas appetizer filled up my 9 year old happily, though we also ordered her a full platter as well.  We also got a rich, full-bodied chicken soup, a little like the tortilla soups you sometimes find at Mexican restaurants, but definitely unique in flavor.  My 6-year old decided to help me finish it before I had a choice.  Ropa Vieja and the Masas de Puerco were fabulous and filling, with the meats perfectly marinated and tender.  \n\nFor me, the only disappointment was the Tres Leches cake we had for dessert.  They don't make it onsite, and it had a little too 'mainstream' texture - a bit too blantantly moist, a bit too much icing, and not enough of that hidden 'cream' that surprises you with the real deal.  It just wasn't right (go to the Cuba Cafe for the perfect Tres Leches!).\n\nBut...other than the cake...this is my favorite of the 3 Cuban restaurants in town that I've tried.  If you want beautifully presented Cuban food, go to the Havana Grill.  If you want a quaint, but up-to-date chic atmosphere (and the best Tres leches cake), go to the Cuba Cafe.

For food we got the red bean soup, avocado salad, chicken fricasse and chicken with yellow rice and veggies. The avo salad was my favorite cuz I love avocados. The beans and rice reminded me of New Orleans red beans and rice, not bad. The other dishes were ok. I thought the fricasse was better. I liked the flavor and the potatoes. The chicken and yellow rice had a mushy texture that really turned me off. It came with some delicious fried plantains. Mmmmm.

Varadero is frugal, however, and the food is just as good, if not better.\n\nI'm itching to try more on the menu because both times I've gone everything has been just delicious. The traditional black bean soup is well done ($2.25), but a more interesting soup is the Crema Aurora, a cream based tomato and cheese concoction ($2.95). The heavy \"soup\" is actually more reminiscent of a dip, which paired wonderfully with the complimentary toasted Cuban garlic bread.\n\nThe Ropa Vieja ($10.75), meaning \"torn clothes,\" was better than any I can remember having had. The rich, tomato based broth was reduced to perfect gravy consistency, and the shredded beef was tender without being mushy. Another highlight was the Arroz con Pollo ($10.95). It consisted of a juicy roasted half chicken hidden under a bed of creamy, saffron colored Cuban risotto. Both entrees came with maduros, or sweet fried plantains, and moros y cristianos, black beans and white rice cooked together. The latter wasn't done as well as at Havana Cafe but the maduros were as good as you can get.\n\nFor the prices and food quality you can't beat Varadero for Cuban food.

Havana Cafe is no longer my go-to place, though it's definitely not a BAD place. Still 3-stars worth. But if you want something more like HOME (in a Cuban home), you've got to go with Mimita's on Warner in Chandler, or Sabor Cubano on Camelback in Phoenix - in that order. \n\nOriginal Review:  I'm a transplant from la sag\u00fcesera of Little Havana in Miami, Florida, to the Southwest. Sometimes I get homesick for the stuff I took for granted before leaving my home.\n\nHavana Cafe is a decent stand-in for Mami's cooking, but most definitely not a substitute. The menu is extensive, and includes some foods from other Caribbean islands, besides Cuba, like Puerto Rico.\n\nI've been here now about 3 times, and always end up ordering the Ropa Vieja, because that is my favorite Cuban dish. One time I got it with the white rice, but because I am always trying to stay on the healthier end of the spectrum, passed on the rice the last two times. I definitely always order a side of frijoles negros (black beans), and a side of tostones (twice fried, squashed plantains). \n\nThe first time I went with a former client and her husband, just after moving here. When she found out I'm Cuban, they wanted to take us here to get my opinion on how \"authentic\" this is. Like I said, it isn't my mom's cooking, but it's pretty darn close to authentic in many ways. Some of the stuff on the menu, I would never find on a menu in Miami either because it's not Cuban, or because it's not something you eat at a restaurant, only at home. For example guava and cream cheese - that's a  dessert you make at home. I remember my dad opening a can of Ancel casco de guayaba, slicing up a stick of cream cheese, and even putting a little bit of dulce de coco on top... Yet, here it was on the menu. It's all good. \n\nOn another visit, I took my parents who were in town visiting for a week. My father was disappointed and lambasted everything from the food to the \"curtains from JC Penney\" on the windows. I think he was more upset that his daughter was not as unhappy away from home as he had hoped so that she would return sooner (if ever). My mom enjoyed her food. My husband who isn't Cuban enjoyed his food as well. I can't remember what they ordered, but everyone was OK except my dad. He even nit-picked about the way the items were all on one plate.

A good friend of mine shares a birthday with me, down to the minute (is that crazy or what?!). So we took each other out for dinner.  She ordered the Arroz con Pollo and I ordered the usual Ropa Vieja. She got Platanos Maduros Fritos and I got Tostones. For dessert, I was going to order a flan, because it just rounds out a Cuban dinner nicely, but they brought out a chocolate bread pudding on the house with some candles on it! It was pretty darn good, too! I would have never ordered that, but now that I know how good it is, I might in the future.\n\nI also noticed a modest set up for a musician near the front of the restaurant and the server informed me that they have live music on Friday and Saturday nights. Nice!\n\nCheck out the website, too - they have tons of events going on: mojito classes, wine tastings, happy hour, mojito mondays, and more.

I'm a fan of tapas and I'll always be happy with snacking on plantains and croquetas. This is a great place to do it. We had the ham croquetas, the empanada and the corn fritters (fried food heaven!). For two people it was a nice, light lunch. What's that? Fried food as a light lunch? How absurd! But believe me, even though all three items (among many others on the tapas menu) are indeed fried, you barely notice. Even with the rich bernaise sauce on the croquetas, it still seems light.\nThe corn fritters have a wonderful blend of corn batter that's just sweet enough without you really noticing it, and the sauce that accompanies lends a nice touch of sourness to balance the act. The center of each fritter is a perfectly smooth and creamy.\nThe empanada is filled with tasty pork, and unlike many other cuban places I've been too, it was not the least bit dry. The sweet mango sauce that's lightly drizzled over it combines well with the salsa to create some unique flavors.\nAll in all, it was a very pleasant experience.

The 6 jumbo shrimp on top were bland, and the rice beneath was salty Uncle Ben's rice. The so-called green pesto sauce was chopped-up green bell peppers. It lacked spices and flavors.

Just enough to say \"what is that flavor?\"  Next was the salmon ravioli over taragon and manchego pesto.  I have to tell you that I'm not a huge salmon fan, it tastes very fishy to me.  I was surprised to discover that the peso actually neutralized the fishiness so that, instead, a robust flavor emerged that was totally balanced by the acidity of a dry graffignia pino grigio.  Next was my favorite dish, sauteed duck breast over granny smith compote & blueberry sauce.  Virtually hauled me into fall flavors and like a warm blanket.  I've had greasy duck and then I've had amazing duck.  This was amazing.  Cooked to a perfect medium, juicy, smoky, sweet, fantastic.  Next was a steak au poivre.

The Austrailan Inkberry Shiraz was a great way to cut the spicyness of the dish.

A forewarning, if you choose to sit at a booth table make sure you're decently tall. I felt like a little kid at the grown-up table. They're extremely comfy but they sink down. Our waitress let us choose where we wanted to sit, was attentive, courteous, and pleasant. She was the only waitress working when we arrived but she did a great job looking after everyone.\n\nOn the tapas menu my boyfriend and I ordered the Plantain Trio. You get three types of plantain and a hummus and sauce to dip them in. All of them are unbelievably tasty. My favourite was the maduros dipped in the mojo sauce - they compliment each other very well.\n\nBabaloos entire menu looks great but I picked the Berenjena con Sofrito. Eggplant saut\u00e9ed with sofrito on top of black beans and white rice. It also comes with tostones if you didn't get enough with your plantain trio. I've always been hesitant on ordering eggplant. I'm not sure how true it is but someone once told me eggplant has to be cooked just right for it to taste good, so I never tried it. I wanted to eat something different here, so I gave the eggplant a go. Lo and behold I have no regrets. This dish was incredible. The eggplant was better than I could have imagined with tons of flavour and the rice and beans left me craving more. What did I drink? For starters, I ordered a Sangria (which you can also order as a pitcher). Their Sangria was impeccable, I highly recommend it. Heck, order a pitcher for the whole table! I followed up my Sangria with a Mangojito. It's Cuban food so you gotta try at least one traditional Cuban drink. It was sweet (that's a given), refreshing, and the mango added a pleasant twist to it.\n\nThe Famous Cuban Sandwich, that's what my boyfriend ordered. He really loved it. It came served with yucca fries and some habanero ketchup in a cute basket. I tried a few of his yucca fries and ketchup and was surprised at how yummy they were. The ketchup was a little bit spicy for me to continue on though. I didn't try his sandwich so I can't say much about that, just that he enjoyed it. It says something when my boyfriend actually wants to go back to a restaurant. I think he's a Babaloos fan.\n\nMy Babaloos experience was a great one. I absolutely suggest making the trip down to this hidden gem of Ahwatukee.

We loved the Platano and Yuca appetizer. \n\nA few \"Yelpers\" recommended the egg plant dish, which I did not like. The rice, beans and tostones that come with it were very good.

It was a little deep (navigation took is a strange way) but let me say, it was worth the drive. We got there around 730 and were told we could either sit outside (it was chilly, no heaters) or there'd be a 40 minute wait, but we could sit at the bar. We sat at the bar, but they ended up getting us a table relatively quick.\n\nWhat a great little restaurant, it had the feel of a small little bistro. so dope. We started with the Yucca Fries with Picadillo and Manchego, soo good. Think Cuban version of chili cheese fries, but not as heavy or messy. awesome.\n\nI ordered the lechon asada which came with a mixed black bean and rice side and some roasted yucca, served with a garlic cream sauce. Loved Loved Loved this dish! If I had any suggestions, I do prefer larger pieces of pork instead of is being SO shredded, but that's a minor thing. The dish is legit\n\nThe wife ordered an empanada and a side of red beans and white rice. The empanada was just okay, rice and beans standard. With the groupon, we got out around 30 bucks!!  What a great little spot, MUCH better than any Cuban food I've had in the Valley.

I was a little apprehensive, though, since other Cuban restaurants were just okay. Thankfully, after a confusing and hella long drive, we arrived to this place that exceeded my expectations. When we got there, they quoted us a 40 minute wait but offered a table outside. With no heaters outside, I was like hell naw (and getting pissed after that long ass drive). We decided to sit at the bar and as soon as a table opened up, we were seated at a table within 15 minutes, so that was nice. While we sat at the bar, my husband ordered a glass of Malbec and they brought out some Cuban bread with honey butter. Being the bread head I am, I ate 75% of it...very good. Flaky on the outside, soft on the inside. For an app, we ordered a Yucca fries app with picadillo and Manchego cheese melted on top (their take on chili cheese fries but with Yucca). They were damn good. I wasn't very hungry in the first place and after overdoing it on the bread, I decided on some red beans and rice with one chicken empanada. I did not like the empanada mainly because it laid on a bed of mango salsa with a sweet sauce drizzled over the empanada. I am more traditional with my empanadas so I wasn't diggin the sweet elements. The red beans were bland but good when I added a little salt. Although my meal was just okay, there are many more dishes I'd be happy to try. My husband's Lechon was delicious, though, and the side of Yucca was just right. \n\nAlthough this place is in the cut, it is well worth the trip. Service was great, too.

For those of you who know us I just wanted to take a minute to leave a heartfelt thank you.\n\nWhen someone opens a new restaurant it is an exciting moment, a nervous moment, a scary moment all rolled into one.  If the worst thing that happens is a rack of wine glasses falling from the roof in a hail of glass then the opening can be considered a success-many have endured far more nightmarish openings in this industry.  \n\nAs the weeks, months, and years go by a funny thing happens to the special restaurants, the good restaurants: they begin to feel like family and people come back.  This was where I came in, almost a year ago today, as a simple restaurant server with over 10 years of previous restaurant management experience.  I was not the best server, but I noticed that both customers and employees alike were always grateful, and made me feel at home.  This was the beauty of Babaloo's-it felt like family.  \n\nTo Robert, Myra, George, Adam, Emily, Jon, Rob, Erika, and anyone I may have forgotten I offer my deepest thanks for allowing me to be part of your lives.  To all of the wonderful people who came to see us over and over again, I would far prefer to work a table seated with people I know, and you all never failed to help me out with that.  Babaloo's did not close because of the folks that supported us, it closed because sometimes in the bleakest economy a business fails, even despite the greatest efforts of those trying to keep it going. \nIt was a fun ride.
