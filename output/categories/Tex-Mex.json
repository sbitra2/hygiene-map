I was ordering two burritos and was further unlucky to have a phone order prioritized between my two burritos.

Sitting at the bar is quicker and the bartender is pretty cool. \n\nBut this entire experience turned into something very horrible. Once we were seated and placed our order for two tacos each, it took Cabo exactly one hour to bring the first order of tacos out to us. Prior to receiving our food, we had to complain to the manager that its taking forever and he advised us that our food is now ready to be delivered to our table. Moments later one of our many waitress' advised us that our order has been lost and they have to start over on making our food. This really had me beyond upset. Once again we complained to the manager and he offered to comp our drinks from the bar and food.\n\nNow, once our food finally came out after many complaints and waitinf for 60 minutes to get it and eating through two baskets of chips, we all thought everything was going to be smooth sailing from there until the one person in my party, who's allergic to tomatoes and onions, began to feel really really sick while eating. She distinctly told the manager and a waiter and waitress that she's allergic to those ingredients three times before ordering. They didn't put the ingredients on her tacos but failed to tell her that they marinated their meats in a tomatoe and onion sauce.\n\nAfter she ran out the restaurant to puke all of her food up the manager kept asking me if I would like another drink and I'm like \"No! You jerk! You guys just poisoned my friend!\". Cabo eventually called security who then called the EMT's who had to treat her. It was so embarrassing. After being treated and filing an incident report with Aliante Casino's Risk Management department we went back to Cabo to get a business card and info of the manager. His name was Joe, he refused to give us his last name, and gave us a business card of Cabo's food and beverage director who's not even located in Las Vegas.

We ended up ordering New Mexico Sausages, Carne Asovada and the Relleno Platter.  The sausages were the best of the lot.  While the relleno was decent, it wasn't anything worth walking the hot parking lot for.  As for the Carne Asovada, the flavoring was so subtle that we couldn't actually taste any...ended up asking for chile sauce.  It took some effort to flag down the waitress since the occupancy level doubled yet again (meaning there is now ~ 10 customers in the restaurant)...but finally, the waitress got us 2 house-made sauces in tiny bowls.  The sauces were okay and did improve the flavor the pork (especially since it was completely bland before)...but any remaining iota of good will from this better-late-than-never gesture was completely banished when we got the bill and realized that we were charged for each of these 2 additional sauces.    \n \nDid the so-call cool quotient or the slightly above average food made up for the service?

We weren't quite sure how the menu worked, and unfortunately the waiter didn't do a good job explaining that seemingly everything except the soups and salads were served with beans and rice, thus making everything entree-sized. We chose to share everything, and we started with the skewers and the grilled shrimp, which are wrapped in bacon. Both dishes were served with 4 dipping sauces (the same 4 on both plates, I believe), and both were cooked perfectly. The meats on the skewers were tender and juicy, even the shrimp, which is so easy to over-cook. The grilled shrimp was delicious as well. I couldn't see the sauces, but everything I tried was yummy. I limited my rice/bean intake to save room for the next dish, but I was filling up fast.\n\nFor our entree, we shared the carne adovada, which came highly recommended by so many reviews on Yelp and Chowhound. And rightly so! I wished I wasn't so full already! The pork was meltingly tender, and the red chile sauce was thick, smokey and spicy. I was stuffed, but I couldn't stop nibbling, it was that good! I would have taken the leftovers home, if we weren't staying in a hotel, as I'm sure this is even better the next day, after all the flavors have melded together. I'm looking for a recipe now so I can try to replicate this dish at home. It was THAT GOOD! \n\nSeriously, Richardson's is a good place to check out for a delicious New Mexican dinner.

Perhaps the way to go is to just ask for them grilled. I think they would be superb then, but stay away from the salty blackened option.\n\nOther than that minor thing, I really enjoyed our experience here. The waiter was a great sport considering we had two comedians with us and put up with all of our silliness. The only other thing was the check sitch.

Beef was tender and succulent! \n\nGreen Chile Stew (*** 1/2 $14.00) Green Chile, Beef Tenderloin, Potatoes, and Carrots with Melted Cheddar Cheese over a Flour Tortilla. The most New Mexican of the entrees we had today... mainly because of the Green Chile which produced a serious bite to the Stew. Ruined, though, by the lack of knowledge of how to cook Carrots in a Stew! Carrots were almost raw... everything else in the Stew had been simmered for awhile, except for the Beef.... Carrots provided a crunchiness that was distracting and not needed in a Stew.\n\nGumbo Pasta (** $16.00) Black Bean Linguine in a Pepper Cream Sauce with Jumbo Shrimp, Sausage, Chicken, and Roasted Peppers over a Flour Tortilla. This was supposed to remind you of Gumbo? The only ingredients that are vaguely Gumbo-ish are just the Shrimp and the Sausage! NOT! Expected a lot more from this entree.\n\nService (****) Our waitress was pulling a double shift... Afternoons at Richardson's and Evenings at Rokerij (just up a few blocks on 16th Street). She was prompt, efficient, and talkative. When the evening rolls around, though, I notice that service drops off considerably... but that can be rectified by just stopping your waitress as she walks by... Simple.\n\nIn summary, a 26 year-old business that will last quite a few more decades. Recommended.

I really miss the food, especially since most of the Mexican food in California is ridiculously bland.\n\nSo here it was Thanksgiving.  I'm getting ridiculously drunk, and I start asking some people if there was any New Mexican food around.  Luckily, some people there had been to Richardson's and they told me about it, and they also told me that they had an amazing brunch.\n\nWell, we didn't make it for brunch.  But we did make it for dinner on Saturday night.  Me and three Brits.  Now they all love their curry, but curry heat and chile heat are too completely different things.  I was so psyched.  I really hoped that the food was comparable to the food I was used to.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the price.  It seemed a bit spendy, but whatever, we're on vacation right?  So I ordered a combination plate that had a carne adovada burrito, a mushroom tamale, and a chile relleno.  My boyfriend ordered the steak with green chile and blue cheese (which is a strange combination in my book, but it turned out to be okay).  The other couple ordered the gumbo and a salad and posole.  We also started with a blackened scallops appetizer that was on the specials board.\n\nWell they started with a few salads for those who got them with their meal.  They weren't terrible, but they weren't great.  I was getting a bit worried.  The scallops came out.  They were unbelievably tasty!  The appetizer was 18 bucks, but it came with six scallops, a bit of beans and rice, and a few chile sauces.  You can't get six scallops for less than 20 bucks at most seafood restaurants!  \n\nWhen the main courses arrived, they looked great.  I have to say that the chile on my meal was great.  The beans and rice were tasty, and the carne adovada brought back memories from my time in New Mexico.  Phenomenal.  The steak was well cooked and tasty.  I even tried a bit of the posole, which our friend claimed was very spicy, but I thought it was perfect, not too spicy and delicious.\n\nI would recommend this to anybody visiting Phoenix.

The Rokerij, Richardson's, Phoenix City Grille and even The Vig.  \n\nTheir first priority should be getting a decent salsa.  Next would be actually trying the food they are putting out and then seeking to make it taste like something good.  \n\nI'm hugely disappointed with the quality of their food.  I give d\u00e9cor and service big thumbs up.  But I won't return for just those two things, there has to be good food too. \n\nPS: I'm shocked to see the rave reviews of the food.

I'm not much of a margarita or tequila guy (BAD experience in high school with a big jug or market-brand tequila-took me years before I could drink tequila again) but their frozen margaritas KICK ASS. In fact, they kicked MY ass. I had either 2 and a half or three and a half-I can't remember but I was DONE after that. SHIT!!!!!\n\nSo good food, good drinks, what could go wrong? Well we had an amazing server called Nicole who was FANTASTIC. She took great care of us and really was an all-around exceptional server. When she told us she was finishing her shift, we closed out with her to make it easier for whoever stepped in for her. And THAT is where the problem was. We were not looked after once Nicole finished. We had to ask three different employees several times for more drinks. No one seemed to know (or care) who was our server, so that was a very disappointing end to an otherwise great experience.

They're making everything fresh in the back, and it took a bit. That was okay, because like all good Mexican places, they had a TV dedicated to soccer and a match had just started. I'm impressed with their menu -- it's a Mexican restaurant with nary a chimichunga or burrito in sight. \n\nMy mother and I shared a small side of guac. (Verdict: okay) Espee's also has a free salsa bar, I liked the mango salsa quite a bit. For lunch, we had puffed tacos. (A taco with, basically, fry bread as the shell.) We played it conservative despite the menu, she had grilled chicken and I had fried hallibut. They were both amazing perfection and lovely at 3.99 each. The fried shell burnt my fingers as I gobbled it down.\n\nI also did try one of the tamales, again playing it conservative with chicken. It was perfection, and the sauce was an interesting chicken gravy. This was also 3.99.\n\nDue to awesomeness, I will be back soon to explore the more interesting items on the menu: eggplant parmesan, raisin and nuts and caramel apple tamales.

You bus your own table. \n\nYou can order ala carte or you can order plate lunch style (one or two items plus refried beans and Spanish rice). They have lots of vegetarian or seafood options, always a plus for me. \n\nI was also confused about the service. I think it was supposed to be a strictly order-from-the-counter, get-your-own-fountain-drink kind of place, but because it was so slow, the counter help was more attentive and accommodating. \n\nI ordered a two-item combo, $8 or $9. I wanted to try the chile relleno and a gourmet eggplant parmesan tamale. My bf ordered a two-item combo as well, but he got a chile relleno and gourmet pork tamale. Our other friend just got the chile relleno, her favorite, she said. The chile relleno by itself was cheap, less than $4. \n\nAfter we put in our order, the counter girl came back to tell us there was only one chile relleno left, so of the three we ordered, two would have to be subbed out. So I sacrificed mine and my friend did, too. I ordered a fish puffed taco instead. \n\nThen she came back and told me they \"found more chile rellenos\" so we could all have our chile rellenos again. But I said I'd stick with the fish taco and just try a bite of my bf's chile. Then she came back out again and said they didn't have the eggplant parmesan. So I reverted back to the chile. I thought it was a little scary that they lost food and then found it. \n\nWhile you wait, they serve chips and there's a salsa bar. \n\nThe food was well worth the price. The I've had better on the chile relleno, but then again, I did only pay $8 for a plate. The chile was pretty standard chile relleno. The puffed taco was a'ight. It was like a little taco salad on a flat, puffy corn tortilla. My only gripe with that item was the shredded cabbage was kind of not well shredded and clumsy. \n\nThe only dessert they had was sopapillas. In one order, you get six small sopapilla triangles, no filling, with cinnamon and sugar and honey to dip. It wasn't great, but it was only $3-something. \n\nWe actually hit this place up to meet with some business partners. The music was a little too loud to carry on a serious conversation. But my bf asked the counter girl if she could turn the volume down un poquito and she obliged. \n\nI would not go out of my way to try this place. I'd hit it up out of convenience.

It seems that they were just taking their time opening it to make sure everything was right. And they nailed it.

The only thing that struck me rather odd was the order pick up counter in the dining area did not seem to fit with the rest of the decor.  But the dining area also extends into the bar area, and if you sit there, you do not seem to notice it as much.\n\nI first stopped for Happy Hour - and what a great Happy Hour. Draft and bottle beer - $3.00, appetizers for $4.00, and well drinks and frozen Margaritas $5.00.  I tried several of the \"lite bites\" including the Cinco Queso Dip, the guacamole, and the Taquitos - all were delicious. And, of course, they have Dos Equis Amber on tap which is a great plus.\n\nI returned for dinner several nights later, and it was just as good.  They have an eclectic menu with a variety of standard Mexican dishes with slightly different ingredients in some to give them a different taste. Everything we tried was very good, and excellent blend of flavors, and hotness.\n\nThe service was very friendly and attentive, from the hostess to our servers, to the bartenders. It was the little things they did that showed they wanted our visit to be a pleasurable experience. They do have several high definition TV's, and we asked that one of them be changed to watch a game we were interested in. They had no problem with doing that, and actually went out of the way to find the channel.  We had a baby with us, and everyone was very helpful and friendly in accommodating us. \n\nI also requested fresh chopped jalapeno to sprinkle on some of my dishes, and they actually had it and brought it with no questions asked, and no extra charge (which does not happen often).\n\nAlthough not as authentic as some of my favorite small Mexican restaurants, it is a great dining experience, and someplace that I can bring friends and visitors.

It's cozy with dark wood and a Spanish feel and it's roomy so that you don't feel cramped and like you're on top of your neighbors. The lounge to the left houses several tvs and comfortable seating and the dining room to the right houses several tables for dining.

Everyone we encountered was pleasant, seemingly happy and genuine. \n\nI have to tell you though, when it comes to eating at SDC, you'll be in good hands, Chef Patrick Bolls hands to be exact. His background includes years working with local chef-lebrity Robert McGrath, which has paid off in chiles. The southwestern influenced menu is well balanced with just a little bit of something for everyone. I mean who doesn't love the addictive crunch of La Canasta Corn Chips ($6)? Along side are 3 different salsas including a smoky charred tomato, a deeply flavored red chile orange and finally a tomatillo green chile salsa. All were surprisingly mild though these seemed more about flavor rather than scorching your face, that'll come later.\n\nThe \"Shooters\" ($8) seemed harmless enough. A chubby jalapeno pepper stuffed with cheddar cheese and bacon then encrusted with a coating of tortillas and deep fried. At fist bite your mouth is filled with a creamy spurt of hot cheese followed by the pork-tastic flavor of bacon. Then it hits you, the burn from the jalapeno is scorching but a quick dip into cilantro buttermilk sauce helped cool the flame. \n\nIf you're still trying to cool the flavor induced fire one of SDC many salad choices will do the trick. The Spotted Donkey \"Chop\" Salad ($12) is prepared table side with you controlling the amounts of roasted corn, cucumber, queso fresco, cilantro, warm smoked bacon, and avocado. Then tossed in a luscious jalapeno buttermilk dressing and served with crispy flour tortilla chips on the side, it cools and satisfies. Composed into tidy rows of tortilla crusted chicken breast, avocado, bacon, chopped egg and manchego cheese and dressed in chipotle vinaigrette, the dinner sized Southwest Chicken Cobb Salad ($12.50) was almost big enough to share. \n\nThe center of my universe, at least for a minute, was the char grilled Big Ol' Jack Ass Angus Burger ($11.50). This is a seriously tasty burger, topped with cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, avocado, jalapenos and horseradish mustard, fries on the side. Continuing with the meat parade, a sizzling iron skillet filled with Fajitas ($16) was placed in front of me. While you have your choice of chicken or shrimp, the idea of beef tenderloin mixed with sausage, sweet onions and tomatoes seemed like the hearty choice. Along side are the usual accompaniments like guacamole, salsa, crema and warm flour tortillas, what was unusual were how quickly I scarfed these down, delicious. \n\nWhile the space feels decidedly modern and upscale there wasn't one moment where I felt uncomfortable or out of place, even with burger juices running down my face.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 5, "cool": 4}}, {"text": "We kept driving by The Spotted Donkey and one Friday night we finally decided to stop by and see what it was about.\n\nWe sat on the patio, which was great.

Not that there's anything wrong with that.  Nothing beats good Sonoran fare in my book.  At Spotted Donkey you will find chimis and enchiladas on the menu, but also cornmeal crusted mahi mahi and pan roasted pork tenderloin.  \n\nWe started with the chips and salsa.  I have to say I was not all that impressed with the chips.  They reminded me more of a bigger version of Fritos than a thin and crispy chip I prefer.  Served with a trio of salsas, my favorite was the charred tomato followed closely by the green tomatillo.  The pineapple habanero may have been tasty, but one bite and my tongue was so swollen I lost all sense of taste for the next 15 minutes.  My husband managed to eat a fair amount of it, however.  I attribute that to his southern roots and exposure to moonshine at the age of 6.\n\nHis entree was the chipotle honey-glazed grilled salmon tostada.  With a black bean mango salsa and avocado vinaigrette, it was quite good.  The only thing negative...it was seriously undercooked in the middle.  Had it been mine, I would have sent it back.  I know there seems to be a trend of rare fish being served, but if this was intentional, the server should ask how you would like it prepared.  I smartly chose the mesquite roasted port antojito...like mini tostadas but served on a thicker corn \"cake\" that is fried.  The pork was perfectly lean, perfectly seasoned, and quickly devoured.\n\nFor dessert we shared the ancho chile brownie sundae which was served with both hot caramel and hot fudge sauces on the side.  Expecting to prefer the chocolate sauce, I actually did not.  Although it had good flavor, the consistency was off and there was a little separation.  I am not usually a fan of caramel, but this sauce was ridiculously good, with a strong hint of salt coming through.  Had it been served with nothing but a spoon, the dessert still would have worked for me.  The ancho chile brownie was fantastic, although I maybe would have preferred just a touch more of chile in the background.  I would be hard pressed to go back and have any dessert other than this one.\n\nI loved the atmosphere at Spotted Donkey, loved the food, and had fantastic service.

After pondering the reason for the older crowd, our food came and it was painfully clear.... the food is bland, perfect for that older crowd that can't handle spicy.    \n\nThe chips were delicious, best we've had in some-time.  They were thick with a nice strong corn flavor.. very nice.  The signature salsas were flavorful, but did not even register as mild on the heat scale. The pineapple salsa, we were warned was very hot... was really on the high end of mild. \n\nAside from the unspicy food..... I can honestly say my dish was truly bland.   My carne asada was a good cut of meat, the temperature was well prepared at medium-rare, there was the usual char... but the meat had zero favor.  No spices at all.   This was a dish recommended by our server over the Mole... I should have tried the Mole. \n\nAnd then there were the tortillas.  This was my biggest disappointment.  They tasted like store bought... you know, that thick floury flavor that Mission Tortillas have.  Even freshly heated, they would have been a disappointment.  Unfortunately, mine were served stale... hardened around the edges.  Invest in higher quality, homemade tortillas and ditch those store bought!\n\nMy dish came with Calabacitas.. which were disappointing as well.

I ordered the tacos with shrimp, he got the cheeseburger.  I think they were the best tacos I've ever had.  The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the toppings were a perfect match.  You could taste every flavor, nothing was too overpowering.  I think the portion was huge, I took two of the four tacos home and had them for breakfast today!  My husband went crazy over the burger.   The burger is HUGE; the quality of meat they use was exceptional as well.  My husband never eats leftovers, we usually take his leftovers home for the dogs, but not this time.  He only ate maybe a third of his burger and when I mentioned how happy the dogs would be he said no, he was going to eat it the next day!\n\nSo you may wonder why 4 stars instead of 5.

It wasn't bad but when you put it next to something as good as those tacos it just doesn't make sense.  I think next time I'll ask for double beans instead of rice.

The menu also USED to be good, and food was good too, but is no longer the case. The three of us struggled with what to order, as nothing really sounded too great. My dad went with a chimichanga, my mom went with a Mexican chopped salad with shrimp, and I decided to have a Caesar with shrimp. My dad actually enjoyed his, until later that night when he became ill.\n\nBoth my salad and my mom's salad were pretty much inedible. The produce was clearly never high quality, as evidenced by the mealy tomatoes and wilty lettuce. But the worst part was definitely the fishy-tasting shrimp. How does that even happen?! How old were these shrimp that they developed a fishy taste?\n\nThe waitress stopped by for about .5 seconds right when the food was delivered, and since we hadn't really tasted anything yet, we said things were fine. However, a few minutes into our meal we realized we needed to speak to a manager about the poor quality of the food (especially since my parents had such high expectations from their prior visit). The waitress was absolutely nowhere to be found, nor was the manager, or any other employee for that matter.

I should mention he looked like a deer in headlights when I mentioned online reviews. \n\nWe expressed our disappointment (but we weren't obnoxious about it, I just really felt that it's only fair to tell the management about the poor food quality before writing a review online about it and told him so), and his response was simply: \"You're the first people to complain all night!\" Oh, great. The first ones all night? Do we get a prize? Does that mean you received food complaints yesterday, and the day before that? We're just the only ones to complain TODAY, which must mean our opinion isn't valid. \n\nHe didn't apologize. He didn't validate our feelings about the food as any good manager would. He just seemed confused as to how we could possibly have these opinions. But it gets better! He then says, \"Well, the waitress said she checked and you guys said you were enjoying everything.\" Seriously? You can see very plainly that we have eaten almost nothing. Talk about feeling uncomfortable-it was like we were completely unable to have a low opinion of this place. \n\nHe said nothing more and walked away. He brought us the bill, with the salads removed, and walked away. Still no apology. We didn't ask for anything to be removed, we really only wanted him to acknowledge that the food sucked and that he'd do something to ensure future guests don't encounter fishy-fish and baggy lettuce.

We were excited about the birthday as well as the highly recommended brunch.\n\nUnfortunately, upon arrival, things went bad and never improved. We were seated at an outdoor table with a good view (one of the few positives), however, a circular pool of vomit was adjacent to one of our chairs. We had to ask for someone to come and clean it up. Instead of \"I'm terribly sorry, let me seat you at another table,\" we just had to stand around the area and wait almost 10 minutes for the clean up to be completed.\n\nDuring the delay, I decided to explore the buffet and what was being offered to make it so expensive. I started at the first area (inside) and was greeted by the stifling smell of rotten fish. Perhaps, that was what made the last person so sick. Moving quickly past to the row of food items arranged outside (where the air was fresh), I asked to see the lamb chops and beef tenderloin, both of which were cooked beyond \"well done.\" Even the prime rib was overcooked and dry. The cooked meats appeared just right for my in-laws from Oklahoma, but out of the question for anyone who typically orders medium-rare. French toast and other egg items appeared to have been pre-cooked, certainly not to order. The only edible item was the fresh tacos being made to order by an old Mexican woman.\n\nI returned to our table after the vomit was cleaned up, decided not to order the buffet and asked the waiter for a menu. My wife and the other couple opted for the buffet (against my recommendation). I waited at least 10 more minutes for the menu to come and the waiter disappeared again. Finally, I ordered a simple bacon cheeseburger and fries for which, again, I had to wait almost 25 minutes. I guess I was being punished for not ordering the overpriced, overcooked buffet!\n\nAfter we were through and left, I asked my wife how the tacos were (the ONLY thing she got from the buffet that she could eat).

The guacamole was really good, but seeing it for $15 on the menu, I don't know about that.  That's up there with paying $9 for a baked potato at a steak house.  I would, however, fork out the $7 for the chips & salsa which is served with four salsas.  The creamy verde was my favorite, but they were all good.\n\nAs for the service.  Jacqueline was really exceptional.  There was a miscommunication on my husband's drink order (mostly his fault), but she quickly rectified it.  And then when he ordered a second old-fashioned, she took it upon herself to take the time to get it from the event bar, rather than the restaurant bar, so that he could have a second wax-dipped glass after noticing we had one sitting at the table.  She also offered to bring us a bag to take home all the stuff we accumulated during the evening.  Ten stars for Jacqueline!\n\nAnd now my friends, I must go eat my leftover enchilada.

If you go for lunch or dinner, Rita's Chopped Salad is tasty, but the entree portion is small... so is the starter portion, but I expected that from a starter.

I'd probably go for a burger or tacos if I end up at Rita's for dinner in the future.\n\nIf you care less about food quality and more about convenience, ambiance, the ability to reserve a table for a group, and/or a place that is kid-friendly... don't hesitate to head to Rita's.

So I think I'm being generous with the 3 star rating.  After reading the yelp reviews I made sure to not get my hopes up, but before leaving Boston my co-workers gave me a gift card here so I had to give it a shot. \n \nOn to my particular experience. . .\n \nThe outdoor seating is very nice, but I wish the chairs weren't plastic.  Plastic works at brunch on a farm, not dinner in Scottsdale.  And I still can't believe how many heaters they had going at full blast, it was a calm 62 degrees when I was there.  If you get cold, throw on an alcohol jacket. \n \nWhich is what my husband and I proceeded to do.  He had the Treasure Margarita - at first he balked at $11.25 but they give you a shaker to pour it yourself so it comes out to be like 1.5 - 1.75 drinks.  He liked it very much, but laughed when I had said another reviewer had called them \"sublime\".  I had a sauvingon blanc which had a funny taste to it.  Meh. \n \nInstead of bread and butter, there gimmick is, as you would guess, fresh house made tortillas.  When the waitress brought ours out she remarked that the spread was a cilantro butter, then proceeded to open the tortilla holder and said, \"Oh, and the tortillas are cilantro flavored. . .they make new flavors all the time so I guess this batch was cilantro. . .\"  Quick hint to OTTF - if you're serving cilantro butter, skip the cilantro flavored tortillas.  The tortillas were very good no doubt sans extra cilantro flavored butter. \n \nWe started with the Chorizo Fundido which was nothing special.  It was a bit too creamy (think sour cream) and not cheesey enough, certainly not the Queso Guillermo at El Encanto which is a bowl of melted cheesey goodness. \n \nSince I'm sort of a wimp when it comes to spice, and considering nearly every dish is marked with a \"spicy\" chili logo, I asked the waitress how spicy the Chicken Calabacitas were.  She said that they are very safe with their \"spicy\" designation and none of the dishes have overpowering spice.  \"It's not like you'd need a sip of water after every bite.\"  I trusted her unfortunately, and was disappointed that I needed a sip of water after every 2 bites.  Besides the spice, the dish was good and bountiful.  My husband ordered the Pork Chile Verde and was disappointed at how tough and chewy it was. \n \nThe highlight of the meal was when we paid with the $75 gift card for the $67 meal (being so underwhelmed, we were willing to forfeit the additional $8 without getting anything else).  The waitress came back, apologized that she couldn't get the gift card to run properly, so instead of being left with $8 on the card she just gave us a new $10 card.

She said the Food Network had them listed as some of the best Margaritas around.  So last Tuesday we stopped by for a few and some appetizers.  The kids ordered their non-alcholic cherry margaritas (on the kids menu) and some nachos. My wife, mother-in-law and I all ordered different Margaritas to compare.  We planned on getting the \"Million Dollar Margarita\" (well reviewed), but at $20 it just seemed steep.  But we were all raving about the Treasure Margarita.  Definately two thumbs up.  We also  some appetizers - \"Nachos Del Sol\" which is loaded with jalapenos, chorizo, pepperjack cheese, pico de gallo, guacamole and probably a few more things I can't remember. It had a kick to it, which I liked..... the small order was pretty well sized.  My wife & mother-in-law ordered the \"Plato Apertivo\" which was kind of like an appertizer sampler (ribs, Santa Fe rolls, nachos, quesadillas, etc).  They enjoyed that.   The Tortillas however, were OK.  they offer different kinds depending on what's the special of the day.  When we went it was Black Bean.  They were fresh and served with a dried tomato butter.  Interesting.  \n\nOverall we had a great experience.  Good, friendly & prompt service and it wasn't crowded at all.  So good in fact that we went back for dinner on Friday night.  This time we went light on appetizers and ordered full meals.  I have to absolutely RAVE about the \"Poblano de Mariscos\" - it was two nicely sized poblano peppers, roasted and stuffed with a crab, cheese, roasted corn, red pepper stuffing over rice with a shrimp cream sauce.  It was AWESOME.  As good as a similar dish I like to get in a small restaurant I like in Cabo San Lucas.\n\nMy wife ordered the Achiote Ribs and my mother-in-law got the Pork Chile Verde.  All seemed quite happy with it.  My sister-in-law got the Penne con Pollo which she quite liked. The kids on the other hand, got orders of Mac 'n Cheese.

We asked for things, like waters, that never came. \n\nCall me crazy, as most people do, but I was also highly irritated by the fact that the chips and salsa here are not complimentary. That's something I expect from a Mexican dining destination. For the top shelf pricing, they could at least throw in a measly chip and salsa bowl on the house. Yeah, their tortillas with cubes of butter are supposed to replace the chips and salsa...... but tortillas and butter? Methinks not. Methinks that I'd much rather have chips and salsa!\n\nThe food is mild to bland, yet it costs a pretty peso. I ordered the \"El Tesoro Del Mar\" - a salad (consisting of mostly iceberg lettuce ick), spicy honey chipotle dressing (waaaaay too sugary with too little spice), pico de gallo, corn, black beans, tortilla strips and large gulf shrimp (only 4 shrimp!! and they were hardly large, more like small to medium sized!!). This disappointment of a dish cost about $15. Overrated. I can honestly say I've had a much tastier shrimp salad at Baja Fresh, for half the price and double the shrimp nonetheless. \n\nI tired some of the enchiladas that Matt ordered, and they tasted forgettable at best. I've had better enchilada sauce from a store bought can. And then my mother, who was in town visiting for the weekend, ordered the grilled salmon. She was so unimpressed by the meal that she didn't even finish it... and she always finishes her food. It takes a lot of skill to mess up something like a grilled salmon. \n\nAs far as their margaritas go, they are good but with the $8.50 to $11 price tag I'm just not convinced that they are worth it.

It's a beautiful place to have a nice dinner and enjoy the lovely Arizona desert climate, and the food is acceptable, too.  Where it really stumbles, however, is price, and for that reason my overall opinion is that Old Town Tortilla factory is simply average.\n\nAmbiance - This is where Old Town Tortilla Factory really shines.  The place is in a cozy cottage compound with a couple of buildings (one being an old house).  The architecture is reminiscent of older architecture in the area, and this place can accommodate anything from small romantic dinners for two to huge banquets and anything in between.  The real star is the patio.  It is lovely year-round, and the lighting and water details make this a very pleasant place to dine.  They even have heaters for those who may get a bit chilly.\n\nFood - The food is just average.  It is a fairly standard/conservative/traditional style menu.  There isn't a lot of avant-garde cuisine coming out of this place.  Still, what they do is done competently.  The food was hot, fresh, and perfectly good.  It wasn't as good as some of the more authentic Mexican places in town, and you can easily find more flavorful, complex, and spicy traditional food.  Still, it's not like their food is bad.  It's pretty good, it's just not anything special.\n\nFood vis-\u00e0-vis Price - If you're out on the town for a gastronomical experience divorced from ambiance, the Old Town Tortilla Factory does not offer a particularly compelling value.  As I said above, the food isn't bad, but it's just standard.  If you put their food in a lineup with dishes from several other restaurants across the southwest, you're not going to be able to distinguish it out of the crowd of other fairly similar dishes.  Despite average food, they have significantly above average prices.  Expect to pay at least $25-30 per person with one drink and a shared appetizer to go along with one of their lower priced entrees.  If you dine toward the top end of their menu, where entrees can reach as high as $35, it's going to be a pricy night.  That, combined with the fairly expensive drinks and the $3.99 sharing charge on split entrees, you're not going to walk away from this for the price of  \"FourthMeal.\"\n\nOn the whole, I give this place three stars.  If I were simply simply reviewing this place based on the food, and I were to divorce the ambiance and atmosphere, it would be a two star joint primarily because of a poor value proposition.  However, considering how compelling the atmosphere is, I'll give them the third star.  The patio is really remarkable, and it's just a very nice place to sit and relax in the Arizona desert.  It's near old town, but it's much more intimate than the very loud establishments closer to Scottsdale Road.\n\nI tend to focus my reviews on food quality, but ambiance is definitely a part of the dining out experience, and that's where Old Town Tortilla Factory shines.  The food is average but overpriced, but the space is just lovely.  It's not an everyday place, and it's not even a place I would go if I were only craving some Mexican food, but if you need a dining experience where the atmosphere is important (perhaps entertaining some out of town guests), Tortilla Factory is worth a look.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "A busy spot in Scottsdale, lots of tourists, spring training baseball fans.

Previously, we had passed the Old Town Tortilla factory on a bicycle ride, and seeing the huge patio, thought this would be a good place for a quiet evening dinner.   \n\nWalking through the spanish-style arch into the courtyard of the tortilla factory, the charm and ambiance enveloped us and promised a perfect evening under the stars.  Then, we met the hostess.  Nope, she says.  No patio dining for at least another hour and a half, I've got a party of 100 that has reserved the patio.  But, she went on, you can have a seat at the bar, order an appetizer and I can see if I can squeeze you inside in a half an hour or so.  We gazed longingly at the gas torches flickering agains the sea of sombreros that filled the crowded patio, wishing we could be a part of that crowd.  Instead, we sat at the bar, and ordered margarita's and Nachos.  These items arrived quickly, narrowly edging out the hostess, who came to tell us our table was ready.  Ok, then, I guess we move into the house.\n\nWe were taken to a nice, open room just past the tortilla manufacturing station, and seated at a four-top next to a very loud party, with laughing and loud-talking puncturing the quiet spaces around.  We settled in to enjoy our drinks and chips.  $5 for a bowl of chips and salsa seems excessive, and the $10 that we paid to get them drenched in ground beef, fresh-sliced jalapeno, guacamole and cheese sauce seemed even more outrageous, especially given the taste.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't ten-dollar good either.  Soon, our waittress arrived, took our order and delivered freshly-made black-bean tortillas with a rosemary butter - actually the most flavorful thing I enjoyed all evening.  I ordered a bowl of chile verde, the wife a tortilla soup, and the young one had \"old-town tacos\", the chicken variety.  \n\nThe daughter said the strips of chicken were too spicy, but the wife enjoyed them, unlike her tortilla soup.  It was a deep red soup, with a drizzle of sour cream over it for pizazz.  She was not impressed positively.  Grab a handful of giant-cubed and steamed Idaho potatoes, a handful of boiled pork chunks, toss them in a bowl, pour a little greenish-looking sauce over them, fling a handful of cilantro leaves on it, and you've got the Tortilla Factory interpretation of Chile Verde.  If the waittress had told me it was \"deconstructed\", I might have ordered something else instead.  Chile Verde should be a thick, savory, spicy-hot stew of potatoes, pork, onion and chile that is simmered together until the flavors are absorbed by the potatoes, the pork is flaky-tender, and the chile heat sneaks up on you like a bandit in the night.  Unfortunately, the OTF chef missed this dish by so far, I'm hesitant to even describe it as Mexican food.  The steamed potatoes hadn't resided in the steamer long enough to take the crisp off, the pork was chewy and the sauce was just ho-hum.\n\nThe Old-Town Tortilla Factory probably rocks the socks off of anybody east of Texas, and that's probably where it should reside - where you find people that just don't know what real Mexican should taste like.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 8, "useful": 10, "cool": 6}}, {"text": "Great place!

The patio looked nice, but hey, it's 104 degrees out - I don't care how many misters you put out there.

Slightly splice with lots of chorizo and peppers.  I think some reviewers may have mistaken the peppers for \"coagulated\" cheese.  We ate the entire serving.\n\nThe 4 margaritas that were part of the deal were \"OK\", not bad, not great, certainly not over proofed.  Just fine for a dinner that you might want to be able to drive afterwards without being overly concerned about being impaired. They are served in plastic shakers and they hold enough for a few \"top offs\".

The tacos were, again \"OK\".  Nothing that you would urge your friends to have, but nothing you would try to dissuade them from ordering either unless they asked for your advice.\n\nThe ribs - a large portion comes with french fries and coleslaw - was again, \"OK\".  No spice on the ribs stood out.  There wasn't the heat I expected. They were just short of falling off the bone done. They had obviously cooked previously and then sauced and fired.  The hit of the plate was the coleslaw.  It had a cumin component that made it really stand out.  The french frys were wilted and soggy, but that's not uncommon when you get 'Q'.\n\nAt this point we were stuffed - and we still had two deserts to go.  Our server recommended the Banana Crisp to have there and the Flan to take home.  The Crisp is sliced bananas in a tortilla that is deep fried and then sauced with raspberry compote.  I can only say that I am not a desert person and this did not make me want to become one.  A cursory taste and we were asking for the bill and a chance to walk some of the food off.\n\nThe bill, $106.50 before Deal Chicken was $4.30 after.  We were happy to have had the opportunity to try the place for more than 50% off.

I had the tequila lime salad and added chicken. The chicken was so dry and had no flavor. As much as I tried to finish it after awhile I had to stop eating. Margaritas were expensive and the alcohol amount in them were small. The beers were pretty cheap 4.25 though. \n\nFourth, the decor was pretty decent. Nothing too fancy we sat outside in the patio they had fans and misters which was pretty nice however they had this fireplace in the middle which I did not understand. Inside the restaurant is pretty ghetto looking for being in Scottsdale. Bathrooms were clean but really small, I felt so cram in the stall. The bar was alright but it looked dirty. The bottles on the wall looked they haven't dust them in months. \n\nFinally, the server was good he seemed really awkward and nerves. I know we were a large group and did a good job getting us drinks and our food correctly. Until the end when we were about to pay we ask to split up the tabs and he said he couldn't. After that we got irritated. We spent 30 mins trying to figure out who ordered what totaling the amounts each person owed and several ppl were paying in cash while others with their cards and what amount of change certain ppl were going to get back. We pretty much had to wait an hr to figure that out and for the server to figure it out. Not to mention that my bf and I had to pay our tab plus the gratuity tip because we were the last ones. What should have been a tab of $53 they charged us $67 (wtf). \n\nDidn't have a good experience I doubt I will ever return.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "It has a nice patio and decent quality ingredients however the flavors are geared for tourists who want to tread lightly. \n\nTo best enjoy yourself here come order a marrita sit on the patio and snack on some chips with your dip of choice.

Very sweet, no sense of alcohol in it, and on the watered down side... Suppose we should've heeded the other reviews on here about them.

I'm going to review Chipotle. Are you wondering why I'm reviewing a spot that is practically common knowledge to most people out there? Well, I figured that there's got to be just one person who looks on Yelp and who doesn't know about Chipotle. So for that one person, here is my review. \n\nOnce you've seen one Chipotle, you've seen them all. Similar to most chains out there, each Chipotle mirrors the next. It's the same food, the same service and the same experience. In Chipotle's case, this is a good thing because I know what I'm getting when I step through those doors. Chipotle kept me fed in college and it continues to feed me when I'm on the go and need some food quickly. It's a couple steps above drive-through and the ingredients are always fresh. You can even go healthy (kind of ) if you scratch the tortillas, avoid the sour cream and chips and focus on the proteins and veggies. \n\nNow for the one person out there who has never had Chipotle, the system is \"cafeteria-style\" where you first choose the type of meal (burrito, bowl or tacos), then you go down the line and pick your meat and toppings. It's pretty basic. I'm kind of the Chipotle weirdo of the bunch because I'm not a fan of their burritos. They are the size of a mini van and just too much for me. I'm also not a fan of the beans and rice at Chipotle. Like I said, I'm a weirdo. I typically opt for either the soft tacos or the bowl and choose chicken, add peppers/onions, add the pico and medium salsa, corn, lettuce and I can't keep myself from adding guacamole. \n\nI suggest Chipotle when you're feeling lazy, you're hungry and you want some solid and decent.

If we ever return for dinner, I will update, but for now, I'll just say this place is really unremarkable and disappointing and that there are *way* better places to go for happy hour. \n\nWe went for happy hour on Friday around 5:45 pm and sat in the bar at one of the high tables. There were only 3-4 other people in the bar area, (and maybe 6-8 in the rest of the restaurant) but it still took the bartender about 5 minutes to come over and take our drink order. I got the Grand Canyon Margarita (featuring cranberry and citrus juices), and my husband got the Cactus Margarita (basically the house margarita). Both were $3. We wanted to order some bar food as well, but again, it took him about 10 minutes to return with our drinks and take our food order, even though the bar was still quite empty. After already being irritable with the slow service (having both worked in restaurants, we are very understanding of how stressful it is to handle a lot of tables or drink orders, but the restaurant was so empty that there was just no excuse), the slow service was not the only bad part of our first experience at Sam's Cafe. \n\nThe next negative was that the margaritas were so sweet and weak, they might as well just have charged us $3 each for juice. Then, it took another 15-20 minutes for us to get our bar food (carnitas cheese crisp, jalapeno poppers, and southwestern bruschetta) and when it finally came, it was all cold! We noticed that no one else in the bar area had gotten food, but all of a sudden, the bartender emerged from the back with an enormous tray of food and served everyone who had been waiting for food at once. Having worked in many restaurants, I know that one of the main rules of good service is that someone should take food out as soon as it's ready so that it doesn't get cold, and that as a server, I was responsible for doing so even if the food wasn't for my table. Either the bartender should have been checking in the back more frequently for food that was ready or someone else (like the manager, who kept wandering around in a daze but never appeared to be doing much) should have done him a favor (if he was really that busy) and brought it out. \n\nThe third negative was that most of the food was not good at all. I know not to expect too much from bar food, especially when it was seriously discounted for happy hour, but two of the things we ordered were just bad. The carnitas cheese crisp was not light and crispy with gooey cheese; instead, it was a heavy and greasy flour tortillas covered in congealed cheese and dry shredded pork. Not good. The jalapeno poppers and boneless chicken wings were also terrible - Jack in the Box has better poppers and the chicken wings were straight out of a Tyson resealable bag. The Southwestern Bruschetta was fine, although it was very oily, and I have a hard time understanding how merely adding a ton of cilantro to a tomato mix makes something \"southwestern.\" None of the food items was more than $5, but I have been to *many* other happy hours where you can get solid, flavorful appetizers for between $2 - $5. Kincaid's and McCormick & Schmick's are two great examples. \n\nThe final kicker of our bad happy hour experience was when we asked the bartender for a check and he tried to pressure us to order more even though we said several times that we were finished. I believe the exact line was, \"Are you sure you don't want anything else? More drinks? More food? Some shots?\" Maybe I'm crazy, but I don't think you should order more to *make* your experience somewhere better; rather, you should order more *because* you're having such a good time.

I'm not a fan unfortunately...  The chips were too greasy with way too much of their seasoning!  I especially did not like their salsa.  It had no heat and HUGE chunks of tomato's! YYYEEAA~UCK.  Way too much work to get to the little bits of salsa that were actually kind of good.  I asked for a different salsa, my server just brought us some hot sauce to add to the salsa.

Very nicely decorated and furnished in the Southwestern style that is common down here but done nicely, not gaudy or tacky in any way. There is a nice outside patio seating area, however considering I'm from Seattle and the temp was still pushing 100 degrees, we opted to sit inside.\n\nOnce we were seated, we were tempted to order the \"Limit-2\" margaritas that they are apparently famous for, but decided against it. After taking our drink order, the waitress brought us a basket of chips and a bowl of salsa.\n\nLet me stop right here.\n\nI knew just from looking at them, that these were no ordinary chips . Not only were they a mixture of different types of chips (regular tortillas, sweet potato, and wontons), but each type was topped in a different seasoning -- my favorite being the wonton chips topped in seasoning and some powdered sugar, giving it a sweet and spicy flavor at the same time. Amazing. I asked the waitress what the seasoning but I swear they were laced with cocaine as well. Hands down the best chips and salsa I've ever had in my life. I would go back just for that!\n\nOnce we overcame the confusion of what the \"Super Salad\" was (it turns out she was asking if I wanted soup OR salad), I ordered the Pueblo House Salad to start with. It was a very nice sized salad (could easily have been shared by two people if someone wanted to), and delicious with their honey chipotle vinaigrette dressing.\n\nFor the main course, I opted for the Santa Fe Stuffed Chicken Breast, which came off the \"Sam-Mex\" section of the menu. According to the menu, \"Sam-Mex\" was created by their executive chef with \"the influence of Mexican, Spanish, Native American and American Southwest Cultures.\" The chicken breast was stuffed with herb-goat cheese and served over a roasted red pepper cream sauce with a pine nut & cilantro pesto, grilled asparagus and southwest rice.\n\nWords cannot describe the amazing fusion of these different flavors as they combined into one superbly mind blowing dish.\n\nI'll be honest, it was hard to concentrate on the conversation with my buddy as I was distracted each time I took a bite -- but don't let him know I said that!\n \nAt the end of the meal, as we opted not to order dessert (or the crazy margarita), we were treated to what the waitress referred to as \"white chocolate tamales,\" compliments of the chef. Of course, know that I have read some of the other reviews on here, it seems that everyone gets these little treats, but whether the chef really intended for us to specifically have them or not was a mute point after tasting them -- a great finishing touch on an amazing meal. \n\nWhile I don't often get down to this part of the country, I will always have fond memories of this little \"cafe\" called, Sam's.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "This is the third time I've eaten here, and I'm sorry to say, but they really flubbed it this time.\nPLUS: Portions are generous.

She tried ordering 4 different things that presumably wouldn't have cilantro on them and each time she selected something the waiter just said \"That has cilantro too.\" How about helping to identify some items WITHOUT cilantro, Mr. Waiter?! When she had finally just decided NOT to eat at all, I asked the waiter if he could go ask the cook if he could make anything without cilantro so my friend could eat.  Rather than doing that, he said, \"well, I know all the ingredients in everything so that won't help.\" Nice. Finally I asked the waiter if the chef could make a quesadilla (tortillas & cheese!!!!!!) without cilantro and he STILL said no.  Do you know why? Because it's served with pico de gallo on top. HELLO?!?! just leave it off....idiot. It was really a terrible experience. Usually restaurants at least ATTEMPT to accommodate food allergies. NOT this one. \n\nTHEN, to cap it all off, I asked for parking validation for the garage when we were ready to go. All restaurants at the Arizona Center give validation for parking because why would you pay an additional $5-$10 just to eat at so-so restaurants?  The hostess responded with a simple, \"Sorry - we're out\". I had no patience left after the no-cilantro fiasco so I inquired further and finally a manager came out and said, \"Oh - no parking? - I'll go get more validations from our sister restaurant around the corner.\" He was back in 1 minute.

Usually a calamari order is $10+ and so small you don't want to share, this is under $10 and enough for 5 ppl.  Delish.  I LOVE that they bring you a white chocolate (and pecan) tamale after dinner.

I want this place to succeed, I really do, but based upon a couple of my experiences here it seems they themselves do not want to succeed.\n\nCanyon Cafe has a really nice location in downtown Phoenix at the Arizona Center. One of its main selling points is the huge shaded patio overlooking the Arizona Center courtyard with tall palm trees and soothing waterfalls. They have some of the best margaritas I've ever tasted. The food is mediocre.\n\nMy first three times here last winter were great. Canyon Cafe was one of my first restaurant experiences in Phoenix, as I had just accepted my first big boy job and had relocated from Pennsylvania. I was in love with the new climate and the countless varieties of margaritas. The food was so-so, but the atmosphere and service received were wonderful. My server was the older lady with shorter gray hair--perfect! \n\nMy fourth time was on a Friday night, and we arrived to a surprisingly empty restaurant around 8:30 for dinner. The chile-rubbed sirloin left a lot to be desired, but the Orange Beso margaritas were its saving grace. I really love these margaritas, and I highly recommend this place for margaritas, and margaritas only, but only if you want to stop drinking them by 10pm on a Friday night. I didn't know they closed at 10pm on a Friday night until the server presented me the check at 10pm saying that they close at 10pm on Friday nights. Seriously? I'm not one to consciously stay past closing time, but giving one of your few remaining repeat customers the proverbial 'foot in the ass' is probably a big reason as to why you have no one in your restaurant on a Friday night. That, and you don't have a HH to lure customers in earlier in the evening. Get with the program.\n\nIn the spirit of redemption, I came here solo for a late lunch yesterday. The place was nearly empty, but that's to be expected at 4pm on a weekday. I picked a nice patio table overlooking the courtyard on an absolutely beautiful 80 degree day. I sipped on my Blue Moon margarita, wayfarers on, giving thanks I wasn't in the torrent of shit that was unloading on the east coast. I ordered the Salmon Caesar Salad and went back to sipping and basking. Five minutes later my waitress returns asking me what I ordered. Sip.\n\nThis particular Caesar salad has apple and pear slices in it, which sounded deliciously refreshing. I was let down when the bowl arrived and the pieces were about the width of a toothpick. The salad and dressing were great, but the salmon tasted too fishy, leading me to believe it was old. \n\nI'm about halfway finished with my margarita when my server drops the check, not even asking me if i'd like another margarita. There are literally three tables in the entire restaurant and I feel like I'm being rushed out again. I don't touch the check, but proceed to sip, people watch, and check my phone to see how the market did. Ten minutes later she opens the check presenter that's on my table,\n\n\"Oh, you're not finished?\"\n    No.\n\"Just enjoying the weather?\"\n    ..........\n\nI think I'm finished now. I'm finished with this restaurant. This place is a headache. Also check out their website. It looks like something I could have created using Visual Basic in high school.

There were chopsticks to eat with, but that would have just slowed me down and prevented me from licking my fingers of all the cheese sauce goodness that was Nachobot.  I really appreciated that the cheese was not just the pre-shredded variety haphazardly thrown on there and expected to melt with the addition of other toppings ('bertos I'm talking to you), nor was it that machine orange cheese sauce (how my standards have improved since college, in all ways).  The Bot cheese is a delicious sauce concoction that is made from scratch so it stays gooey and melty, and is LAYERED and weaved into every last tortilla chip along with the toppings so that it feels like that first top bite right until the very end.  \n\nShockingly, we took some leftovers home.

How is this appealing to anyone to have a big messy drippy mess? Has anyone noticed that the only predominant flavor in the whole mess is onion? There is absolutely no flavor to anything else. You could not possibly ever just try to order a bean and cheese burrito at Chipotle. It is the most flavorless, creation. The beans have no flavor. The cheese is completely void of any flavor.

Ambiance is kind of cool. The ingress and egress at the entrance is unwieldy. When it's packed, there's no room to get to the restrooms or to the salsa bar, or even around the bar.

It was $6.99, which seemed pricey to me. But it was delicious. Salsa \"bar\" has only 4 salsas, and is hard to maneuver when there's more than one person at it. Salsa containers are tiny, so you have to negotiate the crowd to get back to it, and hope you don't spill your salsa on the way back to your table. \"Flight\" of 3 frozen margaritas for $7 is a bargain and very delicous. Hit the spot! I had the crispy Tilapia tacos, and my partner had the Green Chicken Chili. Both were delicious, but both of us thought they were dry. I had to put a lot of salsa on mine to make it not so dry. Otherwise, it was awesome. Our server, Jennifer, was a delight. She does the baking, and that particular day was National Mango Day, so she had baked Mango Margarita Cupcakes. We took one home, and my partner devoured it. It was awesome. Cupcakes were $3 a piece. It took a long time to get our food, but I attributed that to how busy it was. And we were happy eating chips and guacamole from our window seats. We had planned to use a gift card, and Jennifer kindly added chips and salsa to our take-out order so we got to our gift card total (can't use that particular gift cert to include with the tip).

Baffling.\nMeal: Veggie mix enchiladas with mole sauce, black beans and rice on the side. Rice: lumpy, ok seasonings. Black beans: no refried, really tasty and oddly the best tasting thing from that entire experience. The veggie mix enchiladas wrapped in soft yellow corn tortillas with mole sauce: Gross. Just gross. The corn tortillas tasted bland. Did I even taste them? I don't know! The veggies were half cooked and by half I mean some tasted squishy and some were crunchy. Nasty texture.\nTHE MOLE SAUCE.

No longer would I have to wait for a show at the Barrymore to get my taco fix.  I always liked Firefly but I never really make it a destination.  When the west side Tex Tubb's Taco Palace opened a year ago my friends and I went for the Grand Opening.  We had seen exec chef K. W. \"Tex\" Tubb play around town before, including a memorable set at the Capital Bier Garten, and when we heard he would be playing at the opening we made it a point to be there.   I've been coming back regularly ever since.  \n\nI was skeptical of the fish tacos at first.  I had heard of the phenomenon before but I wouldn't have had the guts to try them if not for the prodding of my friend.

The blackened tilapia with the soft corn tortillas was my usual at the Atwood location and I never deviated since I'd usually not been in months.  With the west side location I've been more adventurous in my many repeat trips, and I can say I like all of the fish tacos but I have not tried the shrimp.  The carne asada, el pastor, chorizo, mushroom and ground beef are all good too.  I recently tried the fried avocado, and this is quite possibly my new all-time favorite.

Decent burritos or enchiladas strike me as something that can be gotten anywhere, but a truly great taco is something worth seeking out.\n\nThe downsides to the west side Tex Tubb's: as with all Food Fight establishments the price is on the high side.  I don't like that chips and salsa cost three bucks, but I do like the new salsa bar.  It was one of the features of the Atwood location that I really missed.  Service while generally good can be lax, frustratingly so when the place doesn't seem to be that busy.  The clientele at the west side location skews more to the family set, so there can be a few screaming children to deal with.

I'm not one to hate on the Food Fight restaurants like some, but the standard trope that these places start off strong and fade down the line seems to be the case here.  I've always had a bit of an issue with the cost and sometimes the service, but the quality of the tacos had always more than offset any problems.  That hasn't been the case lately.  \n\nMy #1 complaint: flour tortillas instead of corn.  Three times now I've gotten flour despite specifically ordering corn tortillas.  The first time I sent it back with minimum hassle, but the last two were not fun.  On the second go-around I was initially told that I hadn't actually ordered corn tortillas and then that the even if I had the carne asada doesn't come that way (not true).  Since it was just a tortilla I gave up the argument but stiffed her on the tip and avoided the place for few months, until just recently.  This time I ordered the mushroom taco, and the server didn't linger after dropping off our order was gone before I noticed the error.  I wasn't able to flag anyone down and after 10 minutes or so I just ate the now-cold taco.  What's really annoying about this whole thing is that it's just a tortilla - normally I don't get too excited about tortillas.  If they completely got rid of the soft corn tacos I'd be disappointed but not crushed.  It's just that I prefer the corn tortillas and they're on the menu, so it pisses me off when I continue ordering them and never, ever get what I request.\n\nIf it were just the continual cockblocking on the tortilla front I'd be slightly histrionic but I'd survive.  After all, the fish tacos always come with corn tortillas.  But I think the whole experience lifted the scales from my eyes in a way since I started noticing that the deficiencies in the University location were beginning to show.  The chips are stale and the salsas mediocre.  My request for hot sauce went initially unanswered on two separate occasions, requiring a reminder.  The carne asada didn't taste nearly as good as I had remembered and the achiote tilapia was off.   We once waited a good five minutes at the front counter waiting for the hostess to get off the phone.  All of these little complaints are minor in their own right, but added up it makes me realize that my opinion of Tex Tubb's has turned.

I promise, I didn't make a scene.\n\nIt's Sunday and I stopped about 12:30 by to pick up a few tacos to take home for lunch after doing morning weekend work at my office.  When I arrived, there were a total of three other customers in the restaurant.  Two were sitting at the bar, appearing to be finishing breakfast and margaritas.  The third person was a young woman picking up a to-go order.  As soon as I sat down at the bar, the waitress and the to-go order gal got into a very extended \"discussion\" over a 30 cent discrepancy in the bill.  It took three or four readings of the menu and the same number of reviews of the bill for what appeared to be a possible resolution.   \n\nAs that little tiff was winding down with the first payment of the bill, the phone started ringing and the manager materialized from places unknown.  She went behind the bar, and took an extended  telephone order.  As soon as she was done with that, she went back to to-go girl and engaged in yet another extended discussion which resulted in re-running the debit or credit card with a 30 cent credit. \n\nMeanwhile, the first waitress disappeared.  Customers started coming in.  Another waitress appeared.  But still not even a greeting for me.  Since I am now a mature diner, I told myself to sit tight, they would get my order in and I would be on my way quickly.  After all, for a good 10-15 minutes, I was the only person physically present in the place who wanted to place an order.  \n\nBut, no.  Manager finally came over and gave me a menu and I ordered a soda as that seemed doable.  Then manager disappeared never to be seen again.  Many customers were coming in.  Looked like lots were coming from the Trek ride on the Square.  Waitresses 1 & 2 were having a hard time deciding which tables they were going to wait on, but, for sure, they were not going to take my order.  One guy from an early arrival table was literally chasing one of the waitresses to come and take an order as it was easy to see now what was going on.  So, I just got up and left.  Not sure anyone saw me.   I am sure no one cared.\n\nI agree with many of the reviewers that the quality of the food took a nosedive some time ago.  It's never as good as it once was but I would say you get good decent food about 70% if the time.  If you get the right bartender, they will make you a really fine Patron silver margarita on the rocks.  I will tip them 15% on a to-go order just for that.  The fresh salsa bar is a choice amenity.

Service was good; waitresses have been prompt at getting refills and checking up on everyone, and they let you have enough time to schmooze with your companions as well.  \n\nOverall, the El Dorado provides a nice relaxing environment to have a casual Sunday brunch in a great neighborhood.

The corn cakes is also a much better choice than any biscuit.  However, the poaching of the eggs is often hit or miss.

But after a couple of less than satisfactory experiences left a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended), I stayed away from this Food Fight stalwart for over a decade.  That changed this week.  After a scheduling snafu precluded our group from our first dining option, someone suggested Eldorado instead.  And after a very satisfying Restaurant Week experience, I am definitely a fan again.

After discussing several options with the server, I decided on the Smoking Gun, an intoxicating concoction of infused chili tequila, Scorpion mescal, fresh lime and a splash of bitters.  The smoky finish of the mescal paired up well with both my appetizer and main course.\n\nWhile the bland tomato salsa was nothing to write home about, the fresh guacamole ($5.95 for a MASSIVE serving) was a hit.  The ingredients were well balanced and it had the chunky texture I prefer.\n\nThe kitchen hit it out of the park in the appetizer course.  The Green Chile Pork Stew was the essence of Tex-Mex cuisine in a cup.  The slow cooked pork was melt-in-your mouth tender and the cumin sour cream gave the dish a pungent, earthy finish.  The roasted green chilies added satisfying warmth.  I wish the tortilla strips were a little thicker to provide the dish with some textures.  The thin strips quickly lost their crunch when mixed into the stew.\n\nThe exceedingly tender, thinly sliced brisket was another solid Tex-Mex offering.  Slathered in a slightly spicy sauce with a kiss of smoke, I found the dish to be extremely satisfying.  The serving size was on the large side, which is exceedingly rare during Restaurant Week.\n\nThe sides were hit and miss.  The smoky chipotle dressing gave the potato salad a perfect hit of spicy heat.  The savory green chili pinto beans were perfectly prepared, but could have used some green chilies.  I was less of a fan of the under-dressed slaw - it would have benefited from some of that wonderful chipotle dressing.  I also thought the cold cornmeal pancake was an odd choice - give me a slab of cornbread next time.  \n\nDessert was a bust for me - I ordered the Mexican Coke float (homemade mole ice cream and Mexican Coke topped with whipped cream).  What was missing from that description was the fact there were peanuts in the ice cream and I have a severe peanut allergy (which ultimately led to a date with my epi pen later that evening).  Our server never checked back with our table after serving the desserts, so I was not able to get a different dessert.  That was the bad news.  \n\nThe good news is how the restaurant responded when I contacted them the following day.  I received a phone call from Taylor Anderson, the restaurant general manager and I shared my concerns about unexpectedly finding peanuts in my dessert.  Taylor immediately volunteered to comp my meal.  More importantly, he modified the Restaurant Week menu to indicate the inclusion of peanuts in the dessert, which won my respect.

Susan M said her pork was really dry, and Jennie S really wasn't impressed by her starter portion of haggis quesedillas, which she said had hardly any haggis in them.\n\nOverall the mains were not great quality at all. Dry meat, lacking any flavour in the sauces. A contrast to the home made guacamole. \n\nThe real sticking point was the price. I paid \u00a312 for mine. Given tex mex is a quick and easy food option, with Illegal Jack's and Los Cardos offering giant burritos for \u00a35 or \u00a36 that would be twice as filling and flavourful, this felt like a huge over-charge on Viva Mexico's part. Had they been serving up exceptional quality Mexican food, that was a cut above a tex-mex burrito chain, fine. But it wasn't. It wasn't anything differnet or better (and it was even worse) than a \u00a35 burrito.\n\nI've been to other Mexican restaurants and had very good meals, of marinaded fish, baked cod, and non burrito-dominated meals, with tender meat, fresh lime and coriander, delicious spices. \n\nThe second star comes entirely from the margaritas, which were delicious but expensive. Four pitchers came to \u00a3100 (but between 6 this wasn't so bad). I had an enjoyable meal due to the margaritas and the great company, but the food was a huge let down.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 5, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "A group of us went here for dinner here last week. All I knew of it was that it was a Mexican Restaurant on Cockburn Street, so I had no prior expectations. \n\nWhen I wondered in it looked tiny but when a lovely woman showed me to our table to meet my friends I realised the place is like a rabbit warren and much bigger than it seems. We were sitting in a fairly big room downstairs, full of Mexican trinkets and seemed great fun. So far so good, but then came the problem...\n\nWhen scanning the menu, everything seemed rather over priced. I was a little strapped for cash so instead of joining in on the rounds of \u00a325 Maragrita pitchers I opted for a couple of glasses of average white wine. I also wasn't that hungry so I opted for the haggis and cheese quesadilla starter for \u00a35 and just had it as a main. This was a mistake as it was tiny and had very little haggis in it. Although I didn't have any envy of everyone's main courses as they also seemed pretty average and not very big. \n\nConsidering you can get mini haggis quesas from Illegal Jacks for \u00a33.50 and they are twice the size and have lots more filling, and not just haggis and cheese, I felt a little cheated.\n\nOverall, I loved the quirky Mexican decor and the staff seemed really nice. I wouldn't mind the prices if the food was great but I thought it was barely even good.\n\nIn my opinion, for a decent quesadilla or burrito I would far rather go to Illegal Jacks on Lothian Road or Los Cardos on Leith Walk, unless Viva Mexico ups it's game.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "So I returned with a good friend of mine who is quite the Mexican food connoisseur.

At least I thought I did.  It's now lost in the mists of time and alcohol inhibited brain function. It now occurs to me this 'incident' may have been imagined.  For years, I have moaned about Edinburgh's chronic lack of decent mexican restaurants.  Often someone would pipe up that we already had one in Viva Mexico, and I would launch into a tirade about painfully average mexican fodder slopped out to the uninitiated masses who hadn't savoured the true beauty of real Aztec dining.  Recently, my friend and frequent dining partner McChan had suggested I was barking up the wrong tree and urged me to give it another crack of the whip.  I decided to take his advice, more in defiance than expectation, and book for a work meal I was organizing.  I calculated that any food related disappointment could be quickly washed away upon a sea of tequila and santa themed merriment should I be proved wrong.\n\nThe restaurant has a cheesy but effective mexican themed decor with black and white prints of the likes of Pancho Villa adorning the walls.  Split over two floors it's a wonderfully weird and idiosyncratic shape with lots of little alcoves and rooms downstairs.  Seated upstairs next to the impressively stocked bar full of different types of Tequilla we quickly made ourselves comfortable with a jug of  Margarita (\u00a316.95).  Served with Rock salt around the rim, these were amongst the best I have tasted.  The Cointreau and tequilla were expertly measured with just the right amount of fresh lime giving the drink a real vim to go with its natural kick.  Using rock salt rather than table salt is a revelation and will now enter my rules of culinary fulfillment alongside the likes of never drinking cappuccino after 11am. It really does lift the whole drink.\n\nWe were soon  brought our menus by the friendly, efficient and helpful staff. The classic way for a foodie to spot quality is in the size and scope of the menu.  The bigger the menu, the less fresh the food and the more sloppy the chef. It's a guaranteed formula.  Here the menu is small with quite a few dishes outside of the traditional mexican comfort zone of Burrito's and Fajhita's. So far so good.\n\nFor starter(pictured after a few had already been nibbled!) we ordered the deep-fried squid rings served with spicy chipotle mayonnaise dip and a wedge of lime(\u00a34.95) and a plate of cheese stuffed jalepenos with a sweet chilli sauce(\u00a34.95).  The squid was perfectly cooked and very tender in a lovely soft batter.  The chilli mayo was simply to die for.  The Chipotle has long been my favourite of the chilli family thanks to both its 8/10 Scoville heat and its very distinctive smokey flavour.  Infusing it into mayo makes a perfect blend of creamy, smokey and spicy to dip your calamari in. Lovely.  The stuffed chilli's were not in the same league.  Slightly overcooked they could have benefited for a little more cheese, I suspect some of it escaped as part of the cooking process.  The dip was once again the highlight of the dish.  Less a traditional sweet chilli sauce than a thick, spicy jam it perfectly complimented the creaminess of the cheese.\n\nFor mains we went for the Cabo Style Fish Tacos ( \u00a311.50).  Served in traditional, small flour warps rather than the hard tortilla shells people often associate with Taco's in the UK, this dish was just terrific.  The breaded fish was perfectly cooked, fresh, and incredibly moreish.  Covered in  spicy, crunchy breadcrumbs it resembled a posh fish finger but the taste wasn't in a different league, it was in a different sport!  Adding to the flavour was a homemade cabbage coleslaw and white sauce made from yoghurt, mayo and those lovely chipotle chillies! Messy to eat, this dish is amongst the finest mexican cuisine I have tasted. My only criticism would be that the rice on the side tasted like it came straight out of a packet.  Replace it with a nice fresh side salad and the dish is a 100% winner. Fantastic. All dishes were served with homemade spicy salsa on the side at no extra cost.  It's lovely but go easy because it has a kick.\n\nWell priced, with an average 2 course meal and a drink costing around \u00a320, Viva Mexico is a gem.  If you can get hold of a corporate Snapfax you can enjoy 20% discount on all food and drinks which makes it even more appealing.

Enchiladas are something I really enjoy, but hadn't ordered in a restaurant since the time in Amsterdam where the woman at the table next to me threw up all over the table....

There is nothing chunky or spicy or fresh about it, It is sweet tomato sauce with a bit of onion in it. If this is salsa Ragu missed the boat by -this- much. It is most certainly not prepared there and is the absolutely worst salsa I have ever been served. I took one dip and I asked the waitress if they had any other types of salsa available. She said no. My partner said \"it sort of grows on you,\" so I dipped a few more times and all that grew on me were questions as to how a Mexican restaurant was calling this salsa. I was considering an exit strategy, but we decided to let the food determine our visit.\n\nLooking around the place, it was near empty, except for a large family table, a senior age couple and another couple our age who were also visiting for the first time. I know because they were asking all the questions I had about the menu. Interesting layout allows you to watch the cooks plate up the food. This can either be a great experience or a fearful one. Good lord how many onions are being put on the sizzling plate? What is being poured out of a deep frying basket over them? I don't think this bodes well.\n\nI ordered the half pound Beef Fajita. My sizzling experience was that of two cups of undercooked white onion, one ring of green pepper and a tiny ring of red pepper. Sliced Fajita meat that was charred and chewy perhaps dropped in the fryer? Tortillas which were completely uneven in thickness and sizes (I guess that means they are homemade, right?) They were almost too cold to fold and were damp from being steamed warm I think. EW. Still I was hungry and going to make this work. My condiment plates shredded cheese was fused together as if someone had scooped it partially melted with an ice cream scoop. The sour cream was plentiful but warm. I desperately wanted to add the chopped tomatoes to the salsa bowl, it seems they belonged there, but there were only enough of them for one Fajita so I didn't. The only way I was going to get these fajitas to be remotely tasty was request some lime. Fortunately I was able to secure some juicy wedges which helped. My partner said they liked the beef jerky meat, but it's not what I had in mind. At all. That's ok, the border dinner was sure to please them, right?\n\nNO. It should have been left at the border and denied entry into the states. The congealed enchiladas held the fork in an upright position and refused to be edible. The charro beans were only edible if you pierced the plastic shell of dried beans on top and dug out some bite from the middle. My partner who loves rice didn't even scoop a bite of the spanish rice a roni provided. The dinner salad was a wilted ranch dressing mess and was useful only to put on one of my fajitas. I thought it would add some crunch. It didn't. We stared at the fried tortilla cup that held the queso. Under the skin the cheese heart was beating. Seriously, it wanted to live! It would shudder periodically as if something was swimming beneath the surface. Heat, I imagine, is all that made it percolate, but we had reached a stage in this dinner where we knew it was a bust and everything became fodder for jokes.  I am never going back and I thought others should know that Outback and Lone Star are in the same vicinity.

Let's face it folks, fajitas are made with cheap cuts of meat, in the case of beef fajitas almost always skirt or \"flank\" steak. Yes that's right, the same thing that a lot of places pound flat to make it tender and fry as Chicken-Fried Steak. Fajitas are just a way to make a tough piece of meat edible, and the price of $23.00 for a pound of fajitas is no bargin.\n\nStill, we had the pork fajitas and they were tender and tasty and you can believe that the freshly made tortillas are a treat.

CHECK!  As much as I love me a paper thin authentic tortilla to sop up posole or machaca, when it comes to fajitas, I need what I have now learned are sometimes dubbed Texas tortillas that are pillowy, warm and slightly chewy.  Fajitas makes them with skill.  Love.\n\n2) The chicken or steak should be grilled, preferably over mesquite.  CHECK!  Charred goodness awaits you, and those guys behind the grill are masters of their craft.\n\n3) Steak should be able to be ordered medium rare or rare.  CHECK!  Although you can't specify the temperature of the meat, if you order the Cadillac Fajitas made of beef tenderloin, they come out blissfully mooing in the center.  Heaven.\n\n4) Vegetables should be limited to peppers and onions.  No broccoli, mushrooms, squash, whatever, unless you are ordering vegetarian fajitas.  CHECK!  Ok, I know this is nitpicky, but I don't want my meat, pepper and onion experience to be sullied with broccoli.\n\nAdditionally, if you like shrimp, ORDER THE SHRIMP FAJITAS.  I don't know what they marinate them in or how they cook them, but those babies are like crack.  Pure, unadulterated crack.  Other bonuses - the portions are huge without sacrificing quality, making the whole experience a killer value.  You literally get a raft of guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream and cheese to top your fajitas, making a half pound portion plenty to share.  Or don't share and take home the leftovers.

Now I always order the full pound with half shrimp and half either chicken or steak.  Limited beer selection but that's not a big deal.\n\nOh a reviewer below, Michael E. blasted Fajitas for being \"an Americanized style of Mexican food\" and noted that his GPS listed it under American food, not Mexican.\n\nMike, before you write, please know what you are writing about.  Fajitas are an American food, Tex-Mex to be exact. Your GPS is smarter than you.  They originated in Texas in the 30's and 40's by Mexican cowhands working on Texas ranches.  The American ranch owners would give the Mexican cowboys (vaqueros) the scraps of slaughtered cattle they thought were unusable, one of those scraps was the skirt steak that is still used today in Fajitas. \n\nGo to Mexico and try to order Fajitas at a restaurant, they will laugh at you.

Kept my diet coke full throughout and just filled it up, rather than asking, interrupting conversation as some waiters do.

By the restaurant's title, they stay specialized in what they know, making great tortillas for fajitas. They have regular flank steak fajitas or the more richer Cadillac steak style fajitas.

You have to order the extras separately, but those are things like beans, rice and guacamole.  But, I didn't deduct much for that experience. But, the decor is old.

Choose from chicken, steak and shrimp for your meat, it doesn't matter what you pick because they all rock. The only thing better than the meat is the fresh tortillas. The tortillas are served warm and soft for easy fajitas building.\n\nThe tortilla chips served for free before the meal are a meal of there own. Salsa is complimentary but if you want a real treat get the queso dip for just a few extra bucks. This place serves beers, soda and just about any other alcoholic and non alcoholic beverage you can think of.\n\nThe staff is always friendly and I've never had bad service in all the years I've been coming here, even when it's busy.

That was a nice touch and the kids loved them.  Lastly,  another note...when and if you try this place, you may expect to wait to be seated, but rest assured you won't go thirsty.  The bartender is stationed right next the entrance and the margaritas are pretty tasty.  I upgraded to the ulitmate, to get a splash of grand marnier.  3 stars on the margaritas.\n\nFood: I give the food 4 stars.   My wife ordered the fish tacos, which looked great. Fried white fish and shredded cabbage on a corn tortilla.  She gave them 2 thumbs up.   The kids had the \"Kid's Taco\" meal,  which came with a choice of beans.  They devored most of thier meals.  Their tacos were fried with shredded beef, lettuce & tomatoes.    I had the El Bombero Picado.  Strips of asada steak, covered in a green sauce with sauted peppers and onions.   It was real tasty, but was not as spicy as the menu was leading on.   However, real good.  My meal came with rice and beans on the side and a choice of tortillas.  I chose the \"homemade\" flour tortillas, 2 large tortillas (equivalent to 4 regular sized).  They were awesome.   My meal was great, I would just make a note to have them exclude the melted cheese on my beans next time.  It was a little \"overkill\" , but not a dealbreaker.  I just scraped the cheese off and it they were set.  The rice was nice and fluffy,  real subtle, with a great flavor.\n\n\nService: 2 stars.  I am giving our server the benefit of the doubt, SIMPLY because she was very friendly and helpful when we did get her attention.   She just seemed very overwhelmed and maybe she was having an \"off night\", which may likely led her to forget my tortillas after asking her twice.  Lol!  Once I get the \"homemade\" tortillas...muy bien as mentioned above.  Everyone else seemed to be getting served promptly and had smiles on their faces, which was a plus.  \n\nOverall,  I would recommend this place.  It is worth your time to try.  Remember,  avoid the rush and tell them to hold the cheese on the beans!  Good luck!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Delicious.

There are occasional order screw-ups with the often frenetic pace... and I think workers have trouble hearing over the required glass barriers at the counter. Occasionally I'll get 'short-spooned' on something like black beans... but not too often on the 'double steak' \nfor $2.39 extra.. so I don't sweat it. \n\nMcDonald's divested it's 90% stake in Chipotle back in 2006 as far as I know... and has been crying ever since. The stock's 52 P/E is a lofty valuation so it will be interesting to see if that continues... even though each store pulls in a ton of cash flow.\n\nTrue... Chipotle has considered using antibiotic beef. There's an 20yr beef production shortage and the US Cattle herd is at a 61yr low.  Sourcing for natural beef is a major issue.. so they do seem to be bending some of their former 'goals' to meet demand. In 2013, I believe 15-20% of their beef wasn't 'naturally raised'. There just isn't enough 'naturally raised' beef to supply their growing demand. There are other complaints. Google \"MotherJones Behind the Burrito\" for one viewpoint and \"In Defense of Chipotle\" for another.  I've personally just never bought into all of Chipotle's responsible/sustainable hype... but figure that they are still more responsible than many other fast casual chains. \n\nChipotle is expected to raise prices by 3-5%.

After noticing the early closing duties being done, we looked to see that all the selections of proteins were at the bottom of the pan except for the barbacoa.  \nMy wife ordered the chicken tacos, which had a clear sign stating that they had an OUTAGE of their regular chicken indicating that the chicken they were currently serving, wasn't organic and contained hormones. No biggie its just chicken right?  I ordered the barbacoa burrito simply because it looked like it was the freshest item made to offer.  After sitting down to eat I took two bites and realized that my entire burrito was cold.  I opened the burrito and stuck my finger right into the center to realize that it was not the slight bit warm but entirely cold including the barbacoa.  Went inside to make the Manager aware that the barbacoa was cold.  \nThe manager simply stirred up the meat and tasted a sample for himself.  His reply was, \"yeah its not very warm but that probably because we haven't touched it and stirred it enough..  We don't cook this here, it comes in cooked and we only re-heat it.\"  \nThat pretty much solved the question at hand, they don't cook the barbacoa there and they don't even re-heat it to a sanitary temperature.  I would think these employees have gone through a food training class where the FDA clearly states that between 50 and 140F there can be rapid growth of bacteria in beef.  Food has to be kept above 140F otherwise bacteria starts to grow and doubles every 20 minutes.

All of the Chipotle's that I have eaten at have been very good, except for one in downtown Washington DC where a group of kids ran through the dining room chased by police officers.  They trashed the place, and spilled a perfume display that one of the kids was trying to sell.  Which may have been why the police were chasing them I don't know.  What I do know is the perfume smelled terrible.\n\nAnyway back to Chandler.  The good thing about Chipotle is the menu.  It is very simple.  Basically you walk up to the counter and tell the nice person what you want to eat.  All the food is displayed in front of you.  You can mix and match it any way you like.  Tacos, burritos,   even melted cheese things that aren't on the menu but kids seem to love them.  \n\nThere are a few different kinds of meat.  Carnetias or braised pork, grilled chicken, and two different kinds of beef.  One grilled the other BBQed.  Fresh green peppers and onions lightly seasoned and sauteed but still crispy.  Two kinds of beans, pinto and black.  The servers are quick to tell you that the pinto beans are not for strict vegetarians or the kosher crowd.    Rice seasoned with a little cilantro that is very tasty, and last but not least delicious guacamole.  As your meal (usually a burrito for me) is assembled it moves down the counter to the salsa section.  There are a few different kinds of salsa.  A spicy red one, I don't know what is in it but it is my favorite.  A tomato, onion, cilantro mild one.  Corn relish that goes in my burrito too, and a green one that I never tired.  Then some sour cream and cheese and they magically roll it and wrap it in a tin foil sleeve.  \n\nWith really good food places it is the little things that can make or break them.  For example sour cream.  Pretty basic stuff right.  At Chipolte it is delectable.  I can't find sour cream near as good at any grocery store.  The tortillas are big and seem to stretch enough to wrap whatever they put in the burrito.  Did I mention that these burritos are really big?  If you don't want to go the tortilla route they will make your burrito in a bowl.  Same stuff just no tortilla.  I once ate at the Chipolte in Lawrence Kansas with a friend.  She ate two burritos.  She is a freak, don't try it you may explode.  \n\nThey seem to be proud of their chips.  Most places offer them free of charge.  Chipolte charges for them.  They could be good I've never had them, but lot's of folks order them.    \n\nNo doubt about it this is fast food.  I stopped by last Tuesday at noon.  Just before I walked in 14 giggling high school kids ran up in front of me.  The line was to the door.  Ten minutes later I was at the counter watching my burrito grow.  Amazing.  Just because it is fast food doesn't mean it has to taste bland or be cold.   \n\nThis place is not cheap.  Eight and a half bucks for a burrito and a small drink.

It then emails each of my employees giving them a link to order or a link to decline. If they choose to order, the link takes them right to an online order page with pictures, places for memos, etc. They select exactly what they want and it gets added to our group order.\n\nOnce everyone has ordered, I hit submit, pay by credit card, and fifteen minutes later you arrive at Chipotle, give them a jingle, and they will actually bring the food right out to your car for you. They call this the \"valet\" service. Perfect if you can't find a spot or it is raining out!!\n\nChipotle Executives must have sat down and thought of every pain a company could have in ordering lunch because I honestly cannot think of one thing that would improve this process.

First of all, I waited in line for approximately 20 minutes.  Not a huge deal, since the line is usually pretty long at Chipotle (particularly at this location).  And I was there during the dinner rush.  But still, an extra staff member or two helping out would've been nice.\n\nI finally got my food and headed home with my three soft barbacoa tacos.  A few bites into my first taco, I bit down on something hard and relatively big.  After spitting it out and cleaning it off, it was apparent that it was a rock about the size of a dime (Picture: http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i175/starstruck1980/chipotle_rock.jpg).  I had several other family members inspect it as well, and they agreed that it was a rock, rather than a bone fragment.  Since I didn't swallow it, choke on it, or chip a tooth, I did continue to eat the rest of my tacos (which, despite the rock, were quite delicious).  My family members weren't exactly pleased with me for continuing to eat the tacos.  They advised me to take the tacos back and speak to a manager.\n\nHad I eaten in Chipotle, I probably would've spoken to the manager.  However, since I was at home, I felt that going all the way back and causing a scene wouldn't have been all that effective.  I didn't want to upset anyone, make a scene, and I definitely am not going to sue or do anything drastic like that.  It was probably just a mistake, but certainly a big mistake that definitely should never happen again.  They need to make sure they inspect their food better before it goes anywhere near those serving pans.\n\nI was disappointed because Chipotle prides itself on clean, fresh, organic food, which is why I'm a regular customer.  This experience has left a bad taste in my mouth (quite literally), but hopefully this was just an isolated incident.\n\nAgain, I felt that a Yelp review would be more effective than any other measure I could've taken.  I just want to make people aware of this incident and to be alert for any rogue rocks hiding in their foil wrapped tacos!", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I can go to Chipotle anywhere and it will always be good!

I am not a huge fan to be honest. However, I am going to be optimistic and at least mention what the best thing on their menu is. \nFor the longest time, I honestly hated Chipotle and couldn't put my finger on what it was that I disliked. Then I finally hit the nail on the head. Its the meat! I have tried all of their meats and all have sucked honestly. The steak and chicken are tough, don't have much flavor, and tend to have pieces with grissle. Barbeqoa is wayyy too fricken salty. Carnita's are probably the lesser of the evils but is wayyyyy to peppery. If it weren't for the hubby being a huge fan of the carnita's and guac here, I would have never gone back. But since he loves Chipotle so much and requests it once a month, I had to find something to order that is decent. \nAfter trying tacos, salads, quesadillas, my go to meal turned out to be the vegi burro. Please don't give this review that look. Its actually good and it comes with the guacamole! Yes, I love meat and rarely order something vegetarian. However, Chipotle is the one place I prefer something vegetarian over something with meat because like I said, the meat is soooo horrible. Now when I am forced to go to Chipotle, I get a burrito with rice (I order extra), black beans, corn salsa, hot salsa, pico de gallo, extra sour cream, and guac on the side. These are the best items Chipotle has. I have to admit, their rice is actually tasty, their tortillas are soft and huge, the corn salsa is downright delicious (but who doesnt like corn), and their pico is always fresh with a pretty good flavor. Betcha noticed that I make no mention of cheese huh? Don't get me wrong, I love cheese but Chipotles cheese seems too strong for my taste. Anyways, let me sum up the food by saying that although you get alot, nothing accept the veggie burro is acceptable in my book. Even this vegi burrito is simply ok and tolerable, once in a decade craveable. \nNow as for the service, some of the locations seem to hire people that lack intelligence and this location is no exception to that. Many times, there seems to be too many people behind the counter running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Also, the burritos tend to have holes in them because the roller doesn't know how to roll. \nI will say that I am absolutely puzzled as to why Chipotle has such a huge following. To me, its far from being sensational. Luckily, I have found something decent to order but this is not a place that I get really excited about. About the only time I got stoked to see a Chipotle was in NY after eating multiple overpriced downright depressing meals. Maybe I was just looking for something familiar after being away from home for a week. However, when other Chipotle cravings emerge, I satisfy them and then head to the drug store to get a certain test because obviously somethin aint right!", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "never had anything bad here!  \n\nI love the salad dressing", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Pretty sure most people have eaten at a Chipotle at some point .

The portions are big (and according to the calorie guide on the menu high in calories) but the prices are higher than most other places. \n\nMy one big complaint is, as opposed to the LA street food carts they seem to be trying to emulate, they need to have salsa/pico Di Gallo/ --- to scoop from so the immense burritos they serve can get a scoop of your favorite dressing with every few bites.

I don't just like the place, I love it. I've been obsessed with their burritos since this location opened over a decade ago. I've tried everything on the menu more than once, and although I have my favorites, I can honestly say there isn't one item on the menu I don't love. I consider myself a bit if a connoisseur having eaten Chipotle so many times, this being the location I frequent the most.\n\nSo it pains me to say that everything that makes Chipotle great, from the delicious marinated meats to the scrumptious cilantro lime rice, is almost completely absent at this location. I've eaten here less and less often over the past several months because the consistency of the food quality has deteriorated. Not once, not twice, but multiple times the meat has been so poorly seasoned it doesn't taste a thing like Chipotle. Not just the carnitas, which at times are salty beyond being palatable. Not just the chicken, which has been increasingly bland. But even the barbacoa, which lately has tasted along the lines of boiled beef.\n\nThe rice is a serious letdown, and anyone who eats Chipotle knows this is what makes their burrito special. Poorly seasoned, and yes, frequently undercooked. Sorry, but there's just no mistaking that crunch of uncooked rice. My son had a full two sides if it in his kids meal. That represented half of what was on his plate. We requested new rice, and one of the guys in the back seemed stupefied we'd bothered to complain. The replacement rice from the next batch? Exactly the same as the first.\n\nThe guacamole with our chips and guac was also smooth and creamy, not the typical chunkier texture.\n\nChipotle needs to take a serious look at this restaurant, and decide if it really represents the quality brand they've established. Or maybe it's a case where they've become too big to care. I've already contacted the restaurant as well as corporate, and there's zero improvement. Sure, if you don't eat Chipotle often you might think it's a decent burrito (key word being \"decent\"). If you're a regular, you know how bad it's become.\n\nAll the long time workers at this one appear to be gone now.

It's delicious, the mahi-mahi isn't fishy at all, and the accompaniment of the roasted peppers with the sliced avocado balances the dish.

Avocado enchilada was smothered in a white cheese- the advocado was out of a can - smooth texture with no flavor. The rice and beans were tasty.  I kept waiting for something to kick in after I finished my 2nd drink - it felt like I had 3/4 of a real drink since they were so watered down. My bill was $31. - after tip I walked out spending $36 for a below average meal. Abuelos probably stays in business from sun lakes residents and people in from out of town that think this is the authentic southwest Mexican food.  Go down to Rositas on Dobson/Guadalupe - not much on decor - but the food, chips/salsa, and drinks blow this place away.

It is unfortunate because I love the food here. I booked a party for six for a reservation at 7:30pm. We were seated right away in the upper level of the restaurant. Our waitress came over right away and took our drink orders. It all started out pretty well.\n\nOne of the members of our party had never been here before so he wanted to order three appetizers for us to all share. I recommended the Tejas Trio (queso, salsa and guacamole) and he told our waitress to pick two of her other favorites. Now I understand that he did leave this up to her discretion however, she chose two other items with shrimp and seafood in them. As a waitress I would have maybe considered that not everyone in the party would have liked seafood. I would have understood maybe one other appetizer with seafood but not both. Again, it was left to her discretion so I cannot say too much about this one.\n\nI tried to get her attention two different times to order a margarita, both times she swiftly walked away, maybe I needed to be louder. All things I could have shook off if our meal would have been up to par as it usually is. I had recommended to the other members of our party to order the 21 day aged filet. We had previously had an amazing experience with this steak. Three of us decided to order this item. When they came out they were all New York strip and not filet. Not really that big of deal but when you are a expecting one cut of steak and you receive a different one, it is a little disappointing. My steak was supposed to be a filet topped with a peppercorn crust and topped with a mushroom sauce. It came out as a New York strip, topped with the peppercorn crust but no sauce whatsoever. My dining companions decided to keep the New York strips in lieu of returning them to re-fire filets. I decided to have a filet re-fired because my steak came out completely wrong. I reordered the new steak with the Gorgonzola butter instead of the peppercorn crust because it looked dry when it was brought out.\n\nAfter waiting fifteen minutes, after all of my dining companions were finished eating, I received my new steak. It was a filet after all but it still came out with the peppercorn crust instead of the Gorgonzola butter. I just feel as though the entire night our waitress did not listen to anything we said. I really am not that picky but after getting all three of our steaks wrong, and getting mine wrong twice I was irritated. This was the place that my fianc\u00e9 and I had recommended to out of town guests and I feel as though it was a big let down tonight.

We ordered, onion strings and jalape\u00f1os so we knew even with a backed up kitchen, there's no way it would take that long for our appetizer. At this point, we didn't want our dinners sitting under heat lamps for 15 more minutes while they try to make us an appetizer. We had our 3rd server who claimed to also be \"talking care\" of us check on the food situation, and he let us know that one of the servers must have forgotten to enter our appetizer since it wasn't in the system at all.  We made sure to cancel that order. Then the first server, the one who neglected to put our order in correctly in the first place, had the nerve to come tell us that she will make sure that the appetizer does not go on our bill. Like we were going to pay for food we never received. The rest of the food came out, just a couple burgers. It was decent, consistent chili's quality. At least the kitchen was doing their job correctly. Not once during our dinner were we checked on. We even had an EMPTY beer and margarita and we were not offered or asked if we wanted another round or asked how our food was. Plus the server looked so inconvenienced when we asked for the check.

I try to switch it up between barbacoa, chicken, and carnitas, and with each there has been at least one occurrence where it was way too salty and I couldn't eat it.

I got to the restaurant and there was a line. Usually a line for Chipotle but always moves fast I ordered 2 burritos, chicken for my girl and steak for me so as he was making my burrito I asked for half barbocoa and half steak he asked if I wanted double meat or just half and half and I said half and half. Well the barbocoa pan was full of meat so he gave me a tong full and the steak pan had less than a big spoon full literally 5 little pieces of steak and rather than get something fresh from what they were cooking behind him he passed my burrito off to the next stage of the burrito making phase and as i stood there looking at the 2 burritos with the meat on the rice my girls burrito had almost triple the meat mine had so rather than be a jerk and make a complaint I just asked for double meat which the guy from the next phase of the burrito making he grabbed a heaping cup full of meat. The little cups they usually put the salsa or other sides in and it was what the amount was for being a single meat burrito I asked him to go light on the hot salsa because let's face it that stuff can melt the paint off of a car if you tried. Lol but the guy put a whole ladle full. I just shook my head to which he didn't notice and started wrapping my burrito after placing the other ingredients I asked for in it. So final stage of the transaction of the burrito making production line the cash register guy asked if I wanted some chips or anything else. I love the lime salted chips and of course said yes. I didn't notice the size of the chips till I got home and to a great disappointment the chips were hardly filled to the bottom of the letters of the bag where it says Chipotle.  Which you get more if you buy a 1.49 bag from the store.

After dropping off our month and a half infant at the babysitter it left us with little time, worst part was we had made reservations at a place across town. Thinking on our feet we settled for outback which was 3 blocks away. Hoping to get a table there was an hour wait. I couldn't believe it. Especially when this outback had horrible reviews on Yelp. \n\nLooking across the street we spotted this Chili's and opted for it. \n\nWe searched and searched for about ten minutes for a place to park. It didn't help especially when my hubby is picky about where he parks. [his mustang is his life] but this time he had no choice. Any parking spot would have to do. \n\nFinally getting inside we noticed people were waiting. We prayed th eline wouldn't be long. The hostess told us the wait would be 30 minutes and she told us to take a seat and it'd go by fast. The next people that came in we're told they could wait in the bar.. gee i wish they would have told us that, i could have used a couple drinks. next, another couple came in and were seated right away. My husband got up to ask why and the hostess announced that you can go online and be put on the waiting list. Good to know for future nights to chili's. That'll def save time and help my poor tummy from starving.\n\nOnce we were seated a nice good looking gentlemen came and asked if it was our first time there or if we were familiar with the menu or specials. We said we'd been there a few times but not in a while so he explained every thing clearly and even offered which drinks were the best tasting. \n\nI ordered a strawberry margarita, which i thought ended up being way too sweet and i always order strawberry margaritas when i go out. The hubby got a martini and another drink but i cant remember the name of that one. Food wise, he ordered the beef fajitas which he thought was delicious but not very much meat. Mostly veggies such as bell peppers. I ordered the fish taco's. They were very dry, but good. My favorite and his on our plates was the rice. So moist and fluffy.

I generally prefer the 6th street on the rocks, but the frozen margaritas have more alcohol in them (for the same price--a bit annoying) so I've started ordering those. Their mojitos are also really good. The service is usually pretty good, even when in big parties (I've been with ~20 people at happy hour and the service is fairly quick and friendly; they will also split bills for easier payment). The best time to come is during happy hour, when margaritas are a dollar off and all the appetizers are half price (1 appetizer is usually enough for me). It can get crowded at times, so if you have a larger party I would recommend a reservation, especially if you want to sit inside. \n\nAlso as an aside, they have a gluten-free menu upon request (my friend loves one of the salads on that and asks for it even though she can eat gluten).", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 5, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "Z Tejas\nChain restaurant with predictable yet decent food.

The base margarita flavor was not overly sweet and you could definitely taste the tequila, and the Chambord in ours added a nice sweetness without being overpowering. My only gripe is that the Chambord ones didn't come with a salted rim; I like to at least be asked if I like salt on my margaritas. We also had to ask to have them on the rocks (I also like to be asked if I want my margaritas frozen or on the rocks). Those little complaints aside, we were really happy with the drinks. The chips and salsa were a little pricey ($4.49) and the salsa trio it came with wasn't particularly memorable, but they were a nice complement to the drinks. \n\nFrom my brief glance at the menu, the food looks pretty standard and Americanized, but given how good our drinks and the service were, I'd be willing to go back and give Z Tejas another try for a meal.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "This is one of the few chain restaurants that I love.

Every bite was heavenly. The miso sauce was sweet and compliments the medium rare salmon. Even the potato cake and vegetables that it came with were perfect and unique. \n- Ancho Fudge Pie with Ice Cream - At first I was skeptical to try this dessert because it contained ancho chile, but it really intensified the chocolate flavor.

As the location for the b-day dinner with family, I arrived a bit late (hey, I parked near N. Mill and wanted to walk) and walked in hurriedly, looking around to spot familiar faces. To my left, I saw a young woman waving at me. I looked at her; she looked at me. I looked at the hostess; the hostess looked at the young lady. I looked away to try and spot my family. The young woman waved again. I furrowed my brows and looked around - was she waving at somebody behind me? I looked at the hostess again, who looked equally befuddled. I walked in the direction of the young woman. She said happily, \"Alison!\" I stepped closer, leaned down to let her get a good, clear look at my face and whispered, \"I'm not Alison.\" Then I walked off, turning the corner and locating my party. Of course I had to tell the story to my family. It was bizarre, after all. The hostess walked by a couple minutes later (while I was telling the story) and said, \"Did she think you were someone else?\" I pointed at the hostess to add credibility to my story. \"See, exactly.\"\n\nThat set the stage for a very enjoyable and often humorous dinner. From the topics of \"best friends with naked benefits\" to dirty playground jokes to politics, we discussed a wide range of topics. We also enjoyed our meal. I had a salad with shrimp. The waiter was happy to accommodate my request to substitute shrimp with chicken. I also ordered a 22 oz Blue Moon (on happy hour price). Since it was both my and my brother's birthday (we are 5 years apart), we got two free desserts. I let my family select what dessert they wanted. I would have gone with something chocolate, though. My brother went with the white chocolate lava cake. So did my parents. I ate a little bit of it, but soon noticed that my inability to eat white chocolate hasn't change. It's just way too sweet. \n\nAs for the meals, everyone seemed to enjoy theirs. My dad got the Guiltless Salmon with extra veggies. My brother order fajitas. My step mom got something she didn't order, although it did have chicken and shrimp in the mix. She picked at it. When I tasted a piece of her shrimp, I noticed it tasted burnt. Gross. No wonder she didn't eat much. She didn't seem to mind, though.\n\nAs for the service, it was great. The waiter knew it was a birthday dinner. He was attentive and fast. When the check came, a manager came over to ask whose birthday it was. I, slightly buzzed, gestured wildly and unrestrained to communicate it was mine birthday, as well as my little brother's. The manager thought that was cool. \"It's also their grandpa's birthday,\" my step-mom said. My brother chirped up, \"And the cat's!\" \n\nWe hugged our goodbyes in front of Chili's and my brother and I set off down N. Mill to find something else to do to celebrate. All in all, a very nice birthday dinner. Chili's may not have been my first choice in \"fine dining\" on such an occasion, but I know it's family-friendly and pretty standard in the food and service it delivers.

They have many unique qualities and their service is always streamlined.  This review is for this and all locations I have been to prior. Chipotle......GO!\n\n~Fud/Drink~\nThe food is tasty...enough said. Delving deeper, you can see a bevvy of food options you can sink your teeth into. The meats are delicious to say the least. My personal fav, the barbacoa, really ties the burrito together (Big Lebowski reference). The other meats taste great, but barbacoa is seasoned perfectly. As for the ingredients, everything always tastes fresh, from the salsas to the beans and rice.... everything. You can stack as much of an ingredient into your burrito as you see fit, and I take advantage of this by piling on the the grilled peppers and onions. Is it the finest Mexican cuisine? No... But for someone looking to dine out and not eat a ton of calories like myself, Chipotle does it right. They provide you a menu off to the side that shows all the calories in each ingredient, and its easy to keep the calories off by following what you are putting in. I usually keep out the tortilla, which saves a lot of grief and calories, and still allows me to fill up on fresh Mexi-food. This is completely different to most Mexican restaurants. Nothing is deep fried, but rather fresh and filling. As for a bar or drink, there is nothing beyond a couple generic Mexican beers or a soda fountain. \n\n~Atmosphere/Service~\nI never have much liked the overall restaurant concept, which oozes eat quick and leave. There are no TV's for you to lounge around and watch, music is not piped through the system, and the  chairs are wooden and not overall comfortable. Really, it makes sense, many people do not eat in, they get the burrito to go. It still might help to add a little more atmosphere to the overall experience, if you ask me. The service is always lightning quick. Despite long lines, they still get you in and out quick, and are quick to add the ingredients. Overall, they also are quite kind and talkative, I have never had rude service from service crews.

I mainly eat here because it is cheap and healthier than most fast food. I usually get the burritos but they have tacos, quesadillas, and bowls. The attraction for me is the delicious meats. The barbacoa here made me fall in love with barbacoa because it is so flavorful. The steak and chicken is great too because they are usually locally raised and without hormones. I don't care for the carnitas (pork) here because it is too dry.  For toppings they have three types of salsa, corn, cheese, sour cream, lettuce, guacamole, white or brown rice, black beans, pinto beans and peppers and onions. The sour cream is way too watery for me and lacks flavor. They have chips, soft drinks and beer. That is pretty much their whole menu, but you tell them what to put on your burrito or bowl or whatever you are getting so you can change it up each visit.  One other downfall is that you don't get your tortillas browned on your burrito like you would at some other places that serve Mexican food. The barbacoa burrito I got tonight was $9.24 after tax because I got guacamole for $1.80 extra.  Overall, Chipotle is decent, but it is up to the customer to be creative and go against the norm if you want something like pollo asada then you would have to tell them to skip the rice and beans and just give you a ton of chicken, the green salsa, and guacamole.

We walked right past the man who would be out server and took a seat. The restaurant was slow, only and handful of people at the bar and it didn't look like there was anyone in the dining room at all. It remained this way through out the night. So I am confused on why our service was so slow. While we waited for our server, my father noticed that another server had to make the gentlemen we almost walked right into aware of our presence. I guess we were hard to see, being at a bar table right near the kitchen and all. Through out the night service continued this way. A little tip, apparently you have to order a beer twice for it to arrive at your table, or at least that was the case for dear old Dad. \nThe food was better then the service, but just barely. Charging 50cents a tortilla seems odd, but we went for it because we really wanted to try the agave butter. The butter was good, not mind blowing, but good, the tortillas were small. They can't even shell out the chips and salsa, so I'm not surprised that the portions were a tad on the small side, you get that feeling that they are just fighting to keep their doors open by charging you for every thing they can. I had the sante fe shrimp appetizer as an entree, along with a side salad. I enjoyed the shrimp, as well as the rice they were served over. My salad was nice, the cilantro dressing was boring, but I liked that they used Jimica in the salad. Dad ordered the Green Chili Cheese Burger, meh. My Mom and husband both had the enchilada style lasagna. After they each poured about half a bottle of the house made tapitillo on top it was pretty good. The server admitted that he too uses the hot sauce when he orders it, so they know its bland. Maybe they are trying to cater to the older crowd that seems to frequent the place? Spice is your friend people! \nWe had tried to order another round of those bulldog margaritas before happy hour was over, cause they were most definitely the highlight of our meal. Our drinks were empty, our food was nearly gone, and our server had been MIA for awhile, so when we noticed it was 8 minutes until happy hour was over we flagged down another server and asked him to tell ours to order another round on happy hour prices. Well, the drinks came, but when we got our bill we noticed they were not on happy hour. We had meant to ask our server about this before he ran the bill, he should have mentioned that they were full price, but didn't. Well wouldn't you know, the only quick service he provided all night was swooping in snagging that bill of the table. He had ran the card before we even noticed he had picked up the check.

It is literally walking distance from my house but I'm lazy sometimes and it's more convenient to drive. I think I never reviewed it because I was hoping it would always get better. \nThe owners of this restaurant also own Arrowhead Grill (a fancier steak house) around Union Hills and 83rd Avenue. I figure their goal was to provide a modern take on authentic Mexican/South American food. Their food is overall good. They serve food like tortilla soup, tortas, and chimchurri steak. They also provide a roasted chicken with South American spices that's really good. When it all comes down to it, they're really good at red meats.\nYou can't go wrong with the Gaucho steak or the chimchurri steak. However you want those steaks prepared, it turns out perfect!\nWhen my mother in law ordered the halibut special this past Valentine's Day, she almost didn't eat it because she thought it was too dry. When I order the street tacos with shrimp, the shrimp seemed to be overcooked. So from those couple experiences, I figured it's better to avoid the seafood, but those could have been \"off nights\" those couple of separate experiences.\nThey once had a pork posole soup, but I think that item has been removed from the menu a few months ago. The menu description said it was a spicy posole, but it wasn't spicy at all. Ironically, the chicken tortilla soup was spicier and so much more flavorful. This is another go-to menu item you should try aside from the steaks if you go here. \nWhat's funny is despite the fact that this restaurant is \"Mexican,\" the burgers are delicious! Sometimes on Mondays, they offer buy one burger get the second one free, BUT the beef patties are sometimes smaller when you get this special. Just order the regular non-happy hour burger, and you'll get a 1/2 lb patty that is one of the most delicious burgers you've ever tasted! It's all in the seasoning. There's 2 varieties: chile burger or the plain cheeseburger. Both are delicious! Did I mention they're awesome? The fries that accompany the burgers are just okay. Sometimes they're cooked perfectly sometimes it seems like they've been in the fryer for too long. So sorry, that one's a hit or miss. \nThis restaurant is probably most popular for their Bulldog Margaritas. These frozen margaritas come with a Coronita beer upside down in the margarita glass.

Their brunches are now only on Sundays from 11am to 1 or 2pm.

It tasted like a strawberry daquiri with hints of a margarita on the top. Perhaps, I should've mixed it more? It was awfully sweet though. I'm not sure if the salt on the rim really complimented the sweetness of the drink. Definitely not a drink for a guy though since it was frozen and sweet. \nBack to the Juarez plate. It had a crunchy beef taco with a red sauce, a cheese enchilada, a beef tamale, and chicken enchilada with beans and rice. This plate was off the \"Traditional Mexican\" section. It was pretty good for what it was. I couldn't tell you specific details about the flavor, because nothing really stood out. It was just good. I remember trying the chicken medallions plate at another visit, and that seemed to be more memorable. The fajitas in the past had been extra good too. \nOur waiter was really nice. He was covering so many tables though, and things were chaotic, so he only visited our table about 3-4 times tops the entire time. This meant empty waters and not asking me if I wanted another margarita. \nIn summary, food and ambiance 3 1/2 stars. Service... 2-3 stars. I'm basing this solely on Cinco de Mayo afternoon. I'm almost positve service is better on other days (or at least I'm hoping so)!", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I recently went to Abuelos because it was in the middle of where I live and where the people we were meeting live.

Then, the taco was of good size but not particularly flavorful, and the Chile Relleno was only ok as well.  The same went for the refried beans and Spanish Rice.  Yes, the Relleno was deep fried, an interesting twist, but there was no apparent seasoning in the breading and it was made with a smallish and not especially flavorful Anaheim Chile.\n\nThis restaurant is nice inside but all in all, my experience here was just marginally ok.

I would encourage anyone to go to this location.\n\nI want to take an opportunity to tell you about an experience I had at one of your restaurants last night (8/14/2012). My wife and I chose to have dinner at the Chipotle located at 16680 N. 83rd Ave, Peoria, Arizona. The general manager's name is Joel Crofoot and he is the reason I am writing these comments. My experience went like this.\n\nAs my wife and I were eating our meal, I noticed a young man who was in his US Army uniform standing in line. I am retired from the US Navy and I typically notice anyone in uniform wherever I go right away. So I said to my wife, \"what do you say that I go up and pay for his meal?\"... Without hesitating, she wholeheartedly agreed. After a few moments of time passed, I made my way up to the register and attempted to get the attention of the counter staff but they were very, very busy. It just so happens, that Joel was out from the kitchen area helping another customer in another part of the store. As he was making his way back to the door leading to the kitchen area I stopped him and asked \"Are you the manager?\" He said yes and how could he help me. With my back turned to the soldier and my debit card in my hand, I made a camouflaged motion toward the soldier and said to Joel \"Do you see the military guy over there? I'd like to pay for his meal\".  Almost immediately, Joel said back to me \"I'll do you one better than that. I have the power to make things happen. How about I pay for his meal?\" I was so pleased by that response. As I mentioned, I am retired military veteran myself and when people, like Joel, perform acts of kindness towards our military, it is admirable to say the least. His recognition of the impact of paying for that soldier's meal was instantly obvious to him. He then thanked me for the gesture and said that our intentions were appreciated.\n\nLater, Joel came to our table and again said how he appreciated what we intended to do and how could he not do what he did based off of our example. That was a very humble thing to say. He thanked us, gave us his business card and said if there is anything he could do for us, don't hesitate to ask and said goodbye. The soldier was seated behind us and as my wife and I finished our meal and made our way to the door, I looked over and saw that the soldier was there with his wife and child. So Joel not only paid for the soldier's meal, but his wife's too (their child was probably a bit too young to eat Chipotle).\nI felt compelled to let you and your customers know as soon as possible what a quality leader you have at that store. In the military there is a huge difference between a leader and a manager. A manager leads from behind the troops but a leader leads and sets the example from the front. You have a quality leader in Joel Crofoot. My wife and I will frequent that particular Chipotle as much as we can because of Joel's actions and further, we will recommend that location to as many people as we can because of his actions. If you could do anything for me, I would ask that you recognize Joel's actions towards this individual soldier, because I am certain he'd do it again given the opportunity.\n\nThank you for such great food and better yet hiring great people.\n\nSincerely,\nRich Shores", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 4, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "About a year ago i used to dread coming here only because of the long lines and incompetent  employees,but have always liked the food so i chose to endure it.But my last few visits have been much better.They hired a bunch of new people who are fast and friendly.no more are the days of waiting in line for 20 minutes while the employees slowly prepare each meal,while dilly dallying.The food is always good,and the portions are huge!My only complaint is,if you go in after 9,they're usually low on meat so you end up with less than you'd normally get if it was earlier. they should really have enough prepared for the later crowd because there's always people in there after 9.Other than that,i have nothing bad to say.I am very pleased that they have stepped up thier game when it comes to service.Keep up the good work guys.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Food is very good a little on the pricey side for me.

I came here on Burns' Night with two friends, and when we first arrived at 6pm it was really quite quiet. Perfect, we could order quickly, our food arrived promptly, and it was delicious. I had the fajitas, which was a beautifully sized portion of peppers, onions, and chicken, with all the sides. Miss S had the burrito, and ohmyholylord is that one BEAST of a burrito. They are massive. While Miss M had the quesedilla, and I admit I was jealous of all that grilled, oozy, cheesy goodness. I kinda wanted it all.\n\nThere's a nice, friendly atmosphere inside, and the staff always had a smile on their face. As it was Burns Night, there were haggis burrito specials, and I think a themed Burn Night ticket'd event. Around 8pm it suddenly got super busy and there school-lunch-type queues about 12 people back from the ordering desk for food. I'm glad we came when we did. But no one seemed to mind waiting, so I'm assuming this is what you expect for the Burrito goodness at Jack's.\n\nI also need to give special mention to the pitchers of margaritas. They are the devil in delicious disguise (if the devil were actually something very, very good and just a little bit naughty). Two pitchers later, and me, Miss S and Miss M left quite merry, full of tasty food, and saying \"we MUST do that again soon\".\n\nI can't think of many other places that dedicate themselves to the art of burrito making, but Jack's has it down to a deliciously spicy T.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 4, "useful": 6, "cool": 6}}, {"text": "It pains me to lower my rating for Illegal Jack's but it has to be done.\n\nI returned here last week for a friends birthday and while I do enjoy the relaxed surroundings, I came away very disappointed.\n\nSince my last visit, Jack's have done something which puts them in the same boat as companies like Ryanair. They have started doing 'add on's.' So you look at the menu and think yum, I think I will have a Burrito! That is \u00a36.50. Oh wait, you have to add an extra 75p on to that to put beef in your Burrito. That translates as paying \u00a36.50 for a tortilla with some rice and beans. Not cool. Why can't you just buy a Burrito for \u00a36.50? Why not include the beef in the price? I really don't think a tortilla, rice and beans is worth \u00a36.50. Then the sneaky assistant behind the counter asks if you want sour cream and jalapenos, in the same way that they ask what type of salsa and beans you want. There is no mention at the extra cost. Your \u00a36.50 Burrito quickly turns into costing you \u00a310.10 with a cup of coke. \n\nThe Burrito is huge, but you quickly realize it is made up of mostly rice and beans with very little beef.

We were on Lothian Road, THB was closed and Illegal Jacks was the closest eatery so we went for it.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised at the nice girl serving who asked if I wanted a normal burrito or the deal which was a small burrito and a drink for \u00a35.  Normally those items would cost nearly \u00a39 so this was a bargain.  Especially as the \"small\" burrito was still massive and shared between us.\nI learned on this visit that in order for these burritos to have anything close to proper flavour, you need to spring for the extras - I got jalapenos and sour cream on our carnitas burrito which improved it greatly.\n\nUnfortunately we also got the hot wings (a change from last time's cajun wings) which were coated in a very sour vinegar-ey sauce that was almost the least-nice thing I've ever tasted.\n\nA \"small\" burrito, two drinks, and wings were \u00a312.

The menu is simple to understand - I ordered correctly the first time I visited, idiot proof may well be the word. Looking at the prices, they are slightly higher than other Mexican places I've tried, but you more than get your money's worth in quality AND quantity.\n\nLast time I was there, I was pulling a Johnny No Mates and dining alone.

Most of the group ordered burritos, but I fancied tacos - specifically the hard shell ones Illegal Jacks does. Normally I get half-way through and discover the shell has disintegrated, but this time they actually stayed pretty crispy which was good! The carnitas was odd, seemed quite cinnamony which isn't really what I'd expect and made for a strange flavour combination and not remotely spicy. Also I asked for medium spiced salsa and ended up with the mildest one which was basically just some chopped tomatoes (and I really don't like tomatoes)... hmm, I must have been misheard. The staff too were decidedly production-line like, really different to the friendly guys at LC. My boyfriend, being somewhat merry, was trying to chat to the guy serving us - not obnoxiously or anything, just being friendly - but was completely ignored. The guy did redeem himself somewhat by helping me carry our food to the table though when our food arrived just as my boyfriend nipped to the loo.\n\nOh and they serve Thistly Cross, and a pretty wide selection of it too, which is always good.
