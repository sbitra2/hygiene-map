They went above and beyond, completely out of their way to make sure I could take my leftovers home.

That and I swear finding Jewish style deli in the Bay Area is almost a mis-nomer. Sorry Saul's, but you suck.\n\nThis is cafeteria style deli where you order at one end, they make your sandwich, pass it to the fry guy, and then they put on the pickle spear. They speed it down the bar toward the register where you order your drink and pay and carry your tray to a table where good spicy mustard is (along with regular yellow and ketchup). This isn't Chompie's-you won't get overwhelmed by the menu, but this is a place to get decent hot pastrami, corned beef, and hot sliced brisket. They have other sandwich offerings as well along with hot stuff and the best part...Karsha's rye bread!! Prices have gone up, but this is Phoenix folks, it is still cheaper than the Bay and definitely cheaper than lunch in Disneyland!\n\nSo, for the nostalgia part...\nMy Grandparent's moved to Phoenix in 1949. Miracle Mile started that same year. My Great Grandparent's owned an apartment building right near where Park Central Mall is now. Anyway, Miracle Mile has been around just about this whole time too and started at 16th Street and McDowell which was then called \"The Miracle Mile\". This and Durant's were my families staple weekly restaurants. They had a location at Christown Mall-that was the one closest to where I was raised (back in the day folks-it was a nice mall-think Hilltop back before it was ghetto). Any special or sad occasion in my family here involved a tray from MM. Yep-any. Bris, Bar/Bat Mitzvah, Death, Birthdays, etc. It was always fresh and delicious. That and aside from Katz on Central, this was a place my Grandfather approved of.\n\nWhat was funny yesterday was that when I went to the counter to order my sandwich, the man plopping on the pastrami to my rye was the same guy that plopped my pastrami on rye 20 years ago at Christown. This speaks volumes...\n\nThe food is fresh. The food is efficient. The portions are big and luckily, my situational pescatarian agreed to share a sandwich with me. My guy on the other hand, devoured his entire hot brisket sandwich on a fresh Karsha' onion roll and though he declared my brisket is better, he was very happy.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 7, "useful": 9, "cool": 11}}, {"text": "Seriously.

The biggest difference really was the size these bagels here are double the size of others I've had . My first bagel here was the asiago . The asiago was a plain bagel baked with asiago cheese on the top that melts threw the middle and settles on the bottom . \n\nThe Bagel was good and would be four stars for just bagels and cream cheese  and lox .\n\n\nYesterday a group of us went for sandwiches , two people had the Italian Hero's , one person had Liverwurst ( yes she did ! and she was thrilled to eat it ((not for me)) and I had pastrami on rye . The pastrami is boars head brand sliced thin so you know what that taste like it's not like a fresh cooked pastrami to me but it's ok and the rye bread is your typical Arizona rye that doesn't taste or have the texture of fresh baked rye bread from a bakery . Don't take what I said the wrong way , I am not saying anything was wrong with this sandwich , it was OK . I purchased a bagel and lox for latter , it is Adam Richman SLIDER SIZED it wickedly large , even if I only eat half I am not sure I can open my mouth big enough to eat it . (see photo) \n\nI just ate half of the lox and cream cheese sesame bagel,Gosh! it was good and wasn't in the same category as the pastrami sandwich , This place is truly between a 3 and a 4...... The bagels should be smaller so you can enjoy a whole sandwich as a bagel .\n\nBUT, You might need to examine your Italian hero if you buy one because the casing wasn't removed on the pepperoni in the sandwich and had to be removed before eating .\n\nBesides BIG BAGELS and a million different cream cheeses they make , breakfast , cold & hot sandwiches , Wraps , and they sell deli items buy the pound . This business is a great addition to this part of town even with the Arrowhead location only a few miles away .\n\nas a slight update,1-2-12 I went back and purchased  an assortment of bagels some were very dense and not made correctly so I had to throw them out because you couldn't eat them.

When I told her I was dining in, she handed me a menu and told me I could sit anywhere in the restaurant.\n\nAfter browsing the menu for a few minutes, I decided on the Italian Sub (Ham, Capricole, Genoa Salami, Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, and Provolone Cheese) $10.50....came with Fries, Cole Slaw, and Pickle.  I also ordered a side of Jalapenos, in case I wanted to add some kick to it.\n\nWhile I waited for my food, I looked around the joint.  There are beverage coolers in the front of the Deli that had Sodas & Bottled Water.  I was tempted to buy a bottle of Dr. Browns Natural Soda, but after reading the label I decided against it because it said \"Sugar/High Fructose Corn Syrup\".....how is that \"natural\"?  I'm trying to avoid HFCS, so I passed and got a bottle of Water.  They also have Bagels & Pastries available for purchase.....they looked tempting (see pics), but I wanted to wait until after I had my Sandwich to decide if I would do Dessert.\n\nAfter a few minutes my Sandwich came out.  The thing was piled high with Meat!  (see pics) I wasn't expecting this....I had to remove some of it before I ate the Sandwich, just so I could take a bite.  After a few bites, I realized that it was a pretty dry Sandwich.....so I asked for Mayo & Mustard.  I added a little of both and it still lacked something....so I took the Cole Slaw and put it in the Sandwich....ahh, much better!  The Sandwich by itself was too dry and lacked the flavor of really good Italian Sandwiches....at least to me.\n\nThe Fries were pre-fab Crinkle Fries.....pretty bland, had to add Salt.  They weren't that good.  The Cole Slaw very excellent, not too runny or sweet and had a nice crunch to it, which I like.  The Pickle was eh....I've had better.\n\nOverall, it was a OK experience.

The sandwiches already cost about $8 - $10 on average, not exactly reasonable when you add in the extra fee. \n\nThe sandwiches are made fresh and they took about 10 minutes before they were ready.

Party time, baby!\n\nNew York Bagels 'N Bialys cracks me up. For the life of me, I will never understand this place. NYBB is an eerie combination of bagels and booze. Totally random and off the wall - just like my personality, and probably why I enjoy this place. I know it's hard, but try not to judge this book by its cover.\n\nTheir bagels and bialys are my favorite circular delights in the valley. I'd never even heard of a bialy until Matt and I randomly stumbled upon this spot one hung over morning. I came to realize that bialys are awesome! Instead of getting boiled before being baked like a bagel, a bialy skips the boiling part and just gets baked. Their bialys come in almost all the same flavors as their bagels.\n\nNYBB does breakfast and brunch really well. When I used to live in the 85254, I came here almost every weekend. First of all, they make really great nonfat lattes, mimosas and road rash bloody marys. The coffee is around $2-3 depending on what espresso drink you desire, and it's cheaper/tastier than Starbucks. \n\nFrom the breakfast/brunch menu, my favorite dish is the veggie omelet but all the omelets are pretty delish. They have every ingredient combination imaginable, you can sub egg whites, and you get the following sides: a bagel or bialy and cream cheese, in addition to your choice of home fries (greasy deliciousness), cottage cheese, french fries, tomatoes or a potato pancake.\n\nI also recommend the house breakfast specials. The bagel with nova lox is to die for and the breakfast burrito is filling but it won't make you feel like an oinker. They also have egg bagels with cheese & bacon, sausage or ham!

Not only does this place change its name to the Rush Caf\u00e9 in the evening but they also get the party started with $1.50 domestics from 4-7pm during their happy hour!!! Your buzz will be buzzing with wine, champagne, premium spirits and cocktails. Whatever your little heart desires!\n\nNYBB is one of the cheapest breakfast spots I've found.

The house made Russian Dressing was very good and flavorful and went well with it. For me this salad was a little too busy but still very good and still seemed much lighter than one of those big old bad boy sandwiches.

Abe's does not look like a New York Deli because it is kinda fancy on the inside, but the food delivers a good bang. First off, the bagels are actually boiled in New York water in Brooklyn from a real live NY bagel place. After that process, the bagels are shipped out to Abe's and they bake them daily. Ingenious and the bagels are great, only appearing in the eight or so original flavors (read no blueberry or jalapeno crap). At 90 cents each, that is about market price these days. They held up to the toasting test the following day as well. The onion is great, but all varieties are loaded and sesame is still my fav. I also tried the $8 brisket sandwich and I found it to resemble a NY brisket sandwich in that crumbly kind of jewish brisket way. I appreciate the two sizes of sandwiches. Brisket was ordered lean and for the most part that was true. The two varieties of pickles were authentic and you even get a choice of side dishes here. The Cole slaw was vinegar based, but tasted good after a bite of the sandwich. Thousand Island dressing was standard in NY on the side and that request was also honored.

They're not, but I wanted something reliable and I do like their egg sandwiches so I went in to order one while I was on conference (this is right across the street from the conference center).  \n\nAnyway, I place my order, which was nothing too difficult.  Spinach mushroom and cheddar egg sandwich.  When I visited California in 2009, I had a good experience at an Einstein so I tend to gravitate though I think their bagels are shit.  I mean, hey, NYer here in the duh howse.  So anyway, I wait and the guy clearly got confused.  As it took me till I was in the conference room waiting for the presentaiton to start that I realized the ONLY thing they got right in the order was the type of bagel I wanted.  \n\nNow, at that point I would have just taken it and eaten it.  But there was asparagus on it.  Homey don't do asparagus.  So I stormed across the street.  Honestly, I felt bad b/c they were very nice and I just had a bad food experience across the board so far in Phoenix.  I order something so simple and it got fucked up.\n\nSo I talked to Katie, the food manager, and she not only personally took care of it, she gave me a ticket to get a free sandwich and coffee on the house.  So I said, all righty then.  I took advantage of it, and while they ran out of spinach (seriously WHAT IS UP WITH PEOPLE IN PHOENIX RUNNING OUT OF GODDAMN FOOD IN FOOD SERVICE), they got my order right and it was delicious.

Whatever you do, don't hate on Jacquee's. If you do and I'm around, I might just bust a ninja kick in your face.

They have scrumptious sandwiches, salads, soups, wraps, and cookies to die for, all big and soft like. I am a big fan of the sandwiches. Jacquee's makes the kind of sandwiches I would make for myself at home if I wasn't so lazy. Boar's head meats, hearty breads, and vegetables so fresh they make me wonder why I ever slum it at Subway/Blimpies/Quizno's.\n\nSo basically, in essence, on the whole, the point I am trying to make, to get across, to fundamentally express is that if you work downtown and have not been to Jacquee's for lunch yet, you are going tomorrow (or today if you are reading this in the a.m.). \n\nI feel I have done my civic duty by writing this review!

However, if I go to Big Tom's Shawarma and the shawarma doesn't rock, it's not going to get a good review. I love Espresso and since I'm out of town getting my fix sounded really good. I came across this place because I came out of the patio entrance of Baja Fresh.\n\nSo, I tried the Espresso (after coming out of the patio entrance of Baja Fresh... a different time). I ordered a single shot with whip cream. Not exactly expecting perfection, I didn't even ask them for a con panna, I just said a single with whip cream. First of all, it was practically a whip cream latte. They put it in a regular size cup and the whip cream was so high I had to eat some to get the lid on. So, I grabbed a couple raw sugars and went around the corner and dumped 90% of the whip cream in the garbage. I added the sugars (I make it at home with 1 teaspoon sugar and a small amount of whip) and tasted.\n\nYuck! I couldn't even drink the thing. The whole thing followed the whip cream into the garbage. It was so bad, I couldn't even imagine getting a drinkable latte there.\n\nThis would make the place 1 star. However, being in a charitable mood, I went back the next day for breakfast. (And because there are almost no breakfast places nearby that have sausage options.) So I ordered a sausage breakfast burrito. The burrito bumped the review up to two stars. HOWEVER! They have really, really good home made salsa. Combined with the burrito it made three stars for this joint. If the place were called Jaquee's Breakfast Burrito's and Awesome Salsa, I would give it 4 stars.\n\nBased on Amanda's review, I feel obligated to try the sandwiches.

The bagels are good..they really are. So why do you have to cheap out on the amount of  ingredients in the sandwiches? Are you not making enough profit??? Come on, now...\n\nI kinda stopped coming here a while ago because at $5.49 for a Nova Lox and Bagel I kind of want to at least have the bagel moistened with cream cheese  and have a couple more chips of lox on there with the 3 or 4 capers that garnish it. Ok, I might be over exaggerating a bit, but really, they go rather thin at this location. So I stopped coming here and would go to Desert Ridge to get my occasional fix.\n\nFast forward to present. Got a bunch of coupons in the newspaper and decided to give it a second chance, so have come here 3 times in the past week. Here are my experiences (note that experience #1 is going to be corporate, across the board and has nothing to do with quantity and everything to do with design and marketing):\n\n1. Came in with coupon for new bagel poppers and coffee to enjoy on business road trip to Sedona. Poppers are featured in a cup with a lid leading one to believe they are an easy to eat finger food. DON\"T BE FOOLED! The cream cheese poppers have a coating on them so slick that when you grab one between two fingers in explodes from your hand and projectiles into your windshield where it sticks and slowly slides off. Ok, not really, but seriously, I couldn't get them out of the cup, they kept slipping out of my fingers. I bought their self named car cup to only find out that it didn't fit in my cup holder and the first gentle turn I made out of the mall had the cup in my lap and me dancing in a seat of hot coffee. Add to that the aggravation that the guy taking the order wasn't sure how to ring it up because I got the car cup and....\n\n#2  This actually went ok. Second coupon and things went smoothly, coffee good, bagel fresh and while cream cheese was a little thinner than what I like was adequate.\n\n#3  Now today....ohhhh, today. I was ravenous...ate too lightly for dinner last night and didn't make it out of the house for breakfast until almost 10am. So, today's coupon is buy one bagel, get one free. Never thought about how much that schmear of cream cheese was until I had to actually look at the menu...$1.50, ok, times two bagels, 3 bucks, well, ok. Asked to have my two bagels toasted with cream cheese. First they come to me and inform me that they were out of one of my bagels. Ok. Then, when my order is called up the guy doing so makes fun of my name (my nickname is 'Cia, most think it very pretty, but it kind of loses its charm when the guy behind the counter yells out \"Cia! [snicker] C-I-A!). Went to pick up the bagels and the cream cheese was scraped on sooo thin it was almost none existent. Complained...got a dirty look from the guy that spelled my name and the guy that took my order \"informed\" me that if I wanted it thicker I needed to ask for \"heavy\" when I placed my order...yeah, dude, uhhhm, I just wanted to actually be able to SEE the cream cheese on the bagel before I ate it.

The other complaint that I have is that (like a few above) I swear they are the cheapest Einsteins with their cream cheese.  For the love of God, PUHLEEZ put some cream cheese on the bagel where it is actually not just a thin veneer that soaks into the bagel so that by the time I get to my business, I have just a kinda wet looking bagel.

It's insulting really. If by \"piled high\" they mean bullshit, then I guess its not too far from the truth. Value-wise, it is horrible. In NYC or Chicago, a deli like this wouldn't last a week. Perry's Deli in Chicago has far larger sandwiches that are actually CHEAPER than Stazly's in Madison. There's something terribly wrong with that. The side salad was okay, but the serving was skimpy. If you're going to use a container for a side of macaroni salad, at least fill the damn thing. Rather, it looked like one scoop of macaroni with lots of space around it... perhaps to underscore the lack of value. Unfortunately, I don't think this deli is going to change prices, include a side, or add more meat to their sandwiches. Maybe if for a dollar extra you can get a side of soup, or potato pancakes, or for $.50 extra, a scoop of slaw or potato salad, that might make sense. Since people are so desperate for something decent in this neighborhood, I fear that the local herd of sheep will continue to support this business, despite the ridiculous prices. I mean, for $9, I can go buy my own corned beef, rye bread, and side salad from a grocery store deli, and probably have a decent chunk of change left over. It's another disappointment on the East Side as I am still in search of quality AND value. \n\nAs for the sandwich... fatty, and not in the \"piled high\" sense. For every 1/2 of meat on the slice, there was nearly an equal amount of fat. The bread and the sandwich did taste good, the macaroni salad was pedestrian, and certainly not worth the a la carte price. The sandwich is also constructed to look thicker than it really is, with the meat kind of wadded up in the middle for presentation sake, then thinning out to about a slice or so, I'd say a 1/3 of the way from the center. The wad of meat in the middle gives the appearance of thickness, as you're mostly chewing on bread after a few bites. At deli's that pride themselves on the true meaning of \"piled high\" the thickness in the dead-center of a Stazly's sandwich is actually the thickness throughout the sandwich at the kind of legendary delicatessens that they're trying to be. Service was friendly and decent. However, if this place feels justified in lying (\"piled high\"), and charging ridiculous prices, I have no intentions to return any time soon.\n\nIn closing, I really do want to like this place. I just don't want to pay $9 for a sandwich that leaves me hungry. If Stalzy's wants to be on the level of a Perry's or Manny's, Everyone should be leaving with half a sandwich left to eat later, as 1/2 is enough. If they don't plan on truly piling the meat on, then maybe a price cut is in order. Making things in house should mean better prices.

Most places on the west coast have chicken salad with big chunks of chicken and less of the other ingredients. I think both types are great, it just depends what you like. \nThe potato salad was close to east coast potato salad (once again I say it so you can get what I mean, not because I just like saying east coast ). There are no bits of egg in it and it has an underlying flavor of vinegar. I added a little salt & pepper to spice it up, it could be considered bland. It's also made mostly with whipped mashed and some small chunks of potato.\nThe fries were fresh and hot. \nNow on to the service, which I see has had the most disputed accounts on yelp.\nWhen we arrivedt it was around lunch time and the sign said \"please seat yourself\" so we did. The bus boy came quickly to take our drink order. The waitress came several times to see if we were ready to order, which could be misconstrued for \"rushing you\" depending on how sensitive you are. The food came within 10 minutes and we were pleasantly surprised with the portions (as I said previously). The waitress wasn't very engaging at first , but after our food came, she checked on us several times. As we commented on what we liked she told us more about how the food is made and the owners. She was very pleasant. \nAs we were eating we could hear some employees discuss an issue regarding duties and other employees.\nNow if you are like most people you would find this inappropriate, but for us it felt like home.\nIn any NY deli on any given day you can find the employees discussing everything from their after work plans to their cousin's bypass surgery while they take your order and make your food.\nI mean really have you met an \"East Coaster\" that hasn't tried to tell you their life story? \nSo now that you know,  you can decided for yourself.\nAs for us it was definitely \"East Coast Official\" and our new favorite place", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "My brother and his wife recommended this place when I mentioned that I had wanted to hit New York New York for their\nPastrami on rye...the best.\nWe'll I've found something better!!\nEverything was homemade from the Jewish rye to the Russian dressing.

It does have a chicken flavor that doesn't taste of chix base, I'll give it that, but it is definitely not cooked down enough (i.e. watery) and has neither enough veg or herbs for my taste.

Matzoh ball was a bit mealy too...\n\nNow, moving on to the yum portion of the review! The lox platter was divine. The bagel crisp/chewy, the lox firm and fresh, and all the bells and whistles were perfect. (their capers were different than any I've tasted...almost boozy??? dunno...I liked 'em!)\n\nThe whitefish salad was soooo good! One child did not like it, but the other loved it and so did I.

Yes, yes I can. I don't hate bagels. But I don't love them either. What I do love is matzo ball soup and Weiss serves it up in king kong sized portions that has flavor to match.\n\nMatzo ball soup is one of those dishes that is so incredibly simple yet easy to screw up. Weiss' version has the perfect balance of chicken broth, chunks of chicken, celery and carrots, noodles and of course the matzo. It's served with bagel chips and the \"smaller\" size is enough to tie you over for several hours.

Very disappointing. \n\nWe had high hopes as we wanted to try a non-strip deli (beyond Canters and Carnegie) and hoping for a great find. I was disappointed.

Weiss Deli is in the shopping center on the South East Corner of Sunset and Green Valley, NOT the North East Corner.\n\nAfter trying all the famous delis (Carnegie, Stage, Canter's, etc...) in the big Casinos and noticing they are all a shadow of the originals that I love, I set out to find a real deli in Las Vegas.  Delis are best when they are being run by deli people.  And that's the problem with the casinos.  They are being run by people that don't know the difference between deli mustard and Dijon.  I'm dead serious, I once had someone at the Carnegie argue with me that grey poupon was a brown deli mustard, and my only choices were yellow and Dijon.  If they pulled that at the original Carnegie in New York , there would be a riot.  So although it's a little off the beat and path from the strip, Weiss Deli is well worth the trip.  Only in business since 2006, Owner Michael Weiss is using his Grandma's recipes.  Which explains why Weiss' tastes like it's been around for 60 years.  \n\nAs I always do when trying a new deli, I went with pastrami on rye.  This is the best pastrami you'll get in Las Vegas folks.  Sure the Carnegie is starting off with a great product, but I've had it tough, cold, and sometimes they get lucky and make it right.  But from the first bite of this sandwich, I knew they were serious about how to prepare pastrami.  It was piping hot, it was perfectly steamed, it had plenty of fat on it (which adds to the flavor).  Even though it was my only time eating here, I can almost guarantee it's great every time.  The guy cures his own pastrami, enough said.  The flavor was perfect and while I might prefer Langer's in LA just a little better, this is a good 2nd.  Every bite of that sandwich was a joy to eat.  Also we need to talk about one of the most impressive rye breads that I've ever seen.  Each slice of rye is about 8 inches high and 10 inches wide.  Freshly baked on site, I'd love to see a whole loaf of that rye.  It had a nice crunchy crust, but with a rye bread that large, even with a huge pile of meat in it, the crust was almost a picture frame surrounding the delicious soft seeded rye.  Served with National Deli Mustard, I can't wait to enjoy this sandwich again.  Also not to be missed was the side of potato salad (which I couldn't keep my wife from eating - I think I only had like 2 bites of it before she claimed it as her own).  It's almost like a mashed potato salad since the potatoes are so soft and mashed together with egg and mayo.  It reminded me of the flavor of the famous Rascal House Potato Salad, and that's the highest compliment I can pay it.\n\nThe wife had \"The Remington\".  It was hot roast beef, melted swiss & cheddar jack, grilled onions, on grilled rye bread.  It was supposed to come with horseradish sauce, but she isn't a fan of that, so we went with a side of brown gravy to dip it in.  Excellent sandwich.  They messed up a little bit, since we ordered it open face (which is usually how it comes) but it was still good as a sandwich.  The roast beef was very tasty and their brown gravy outstanding.  Her side of french fries were pretty boring however, but so what, the sandwich is so large, you don't need them.  Each sandwich was served with a half a pickle and half a pickled tomato.  I wouldn't be surprised if they pickled them on site.\n\nI also tried a combo appetizer of chopped liver and white fish salad.  What a great idea to be able to get a scoop of each right next to each other.  I was surprised it was only served on a large lettuce leaf with a black olive and a pickle spear.  It wasn't brought by our waitress, so when I asked her where all the veggies were, she was shocked that they sent it out like that.  So she rounded up some tomato and red onion.  I'm used to carrots, and cucumber, maybe bell peppers as well.  The presentation wasn't very good, but since it got messed up, I'm not sure how it's supposed to look, or what's supposed to be on it.    I preferred the white fish salad to the chopped liver.  Excellent whitefish salad!  Not too salty, nice and smokey with plenty of mayo.  The chopped liver was just ok, but still better than most places.\n\nAnd last but not least, the prices.  Only $10.95 for a huge Pastrami Sandwich.  I was shocked.  For that quality and size, that's $15 anywhere else.  And if you get one at a deli on the strip, maybe it will be $20.

Due to this fact, I naturally gravitated to this Jewish deli. I love tongue and was even more enthusiastic when I saw their specials board. The offering of calves liver and onions ($15.95) caught my eye and I knew I had to get it. Liver has a strong flavor that can be off putting for most, but growing up with all these alternative cuts, I enjoyed it. The caramelized onions where sweet and contrasted well with the salty/peppery bacon. Add a brown gravy on top and the dish was tasty. If that was not enough food, it came with a choice of soup or side salad, veggies, and mashed or broiled potatoes. I am starting to think that the Jews and Asians share similar souls because of what we are willing to eat and the quantity given. Nothing that came out of the kitchen was skimpy or small. In fact, most things could probably be shared. Watching the monster sandwiches pass by made my friend question how someone could eat it without dislocating their jaw.\n\nSadly, this score is given for the lack of customer service.

I never heard of this little gem hiding in Henderson. While we were waiting, it gave us a chance to look over the menu. They have a pretty good size menu from Breakfast to hearty lunch and dinner style entrees. They also have a white board with daily specials that change day to day. When we finally were able to sit down, the service started to shine. The waiter came right away and was very courteous and efficient. We already knew what we wanted since we were waiting for about 30-40 min. Was the wait worth it. I sure in the hell say YES!! Waiting for our order, I noticed the food coming out. Big hulking sandwiches piled high with Corned Beef, and other huge deli sandwiches being ordered. Matzo ball soup with asteroid size Matzo ball in the middle. My wife ordered the Homemade Corned Beef Hash plate with eggs, skillet potatoes and a fresh made Bagel with Cream Cheese. Who wants toast when you can have a fresh made bagel done the real way. The Cream Cheese was fresh and you get a big ol helping of it. The Corned Beef Hash looked heavenly. Crispy and flaky with a hint of caramelizing on the meat with an amazing blend of seasonings. The best part is that it wasn't salty like the can stuff. It was perfect as is. The bagel was fluffy and toasted just right. Just enough crunch but still kept its soft and chewy texture. I ordered the San Gennaro Omelet. Loaded with chunks of Italian Sausage, Basil, Garlic, Mozzarella Cheese, and Marinara. It wasn't sloppy and it was made flat and not folded which I liked. Made it more appealing and easier to eat. It covered the whole plate. It also came with a side of skillet potatoes and your choice of Toast or Bagel. Yeah, I went for the bagel. You can get toast anywhere lol. I had to try the bagel and glad I made that choice. I jumped in to that Omelette and was blown away. You could taste each of the ingredients and the blended together perfectly in your mouth. Normally, I scarf down my food hella quick, but this had me take my time and enjoy it. I can go on and on and there is so much to choose from. The big hulking deli sandwiches, breakfasts and lunch entrees I know Ill be back again. Plus, I know where to get some amazing bagels to go, since they have a little shop on the side to get stuff to go.

I stumbled across it one day in the back of a strip shopping center at Green Valley Parkway and Sunset in Henderson, and have returned there many times since.  Weiss in Henderson and the Bagel Cafe near Summerlin are my two favorite Jewish delis in the LV area.  Having lived in Manhattan (NYC) for so long where I had my choice of high quality delis, Weiss probably comes the closest in comparison to any found in NYC.  The food is prepared the way a traditional Jewish \"bubbie\" would make it (lol).  Try the pancakes...they use a special cake flour from overseas that makes their pancakes flavorful and fluffy.  They're killer, and put ANY IHOP or Denny's to shame.  I introduced several of my friends to Weiss and they ALL go bonkers over the pancakes. Weiss makes a proper chicken soup, too.  If you order one, the tasty baseball-sized matzo ball is like a prize in the the middle of your big bowl to keep carving into.  I also like the chopped chicken liver pate.  Not too many people would order such a delicacy, but it's the best I've found in Las Vegas--and I'm picky.  Lastly, the sandwiches are generously portioned and made the right way.  Simple, high-quality ingredients are used--none of that processed \"meat\" you find at Subway or other sandwich shops.  The bread is freshly baked and cut on the premises.  At Weiss, the full menu is available all day long, so you can have those special pancakes for lunch or dinner if you want.  And as you leave, stop by the adjoining bakery, for a sack of fresh bagels to go or a sweet rugelach bite for dessert.

The inside isn't very big so I imagine trying to eat here on the weekend is a zoo. When you walk inside towards the left they have bagels & pastries for sale. I took a look but the case was empty and I was told by our server that they sell out quick in the mornings. They have a board when you enter that tells you what specials are going on that day.\n\nThey have a section on the menu that says \"not so hungry\" for those feeling like they can't tackle a whole sandwich themselves. You get 1/2 of a sandwich (your choice from the sandwich station area on the menu) and your choice of either a cup of soup, fries, coleslaw,  potato salad or fresh fruit on the side.

The 1/2 sandwich was so big that I had to cut it in half just to eat it. The bread was seriously delicious!  I could only eat a portion of my sandwich and took the rest home for later.

Lots of lox. In the past we went to Kashman's, but the times are a changing and JJ's Delicatessen has improved on our usual New York-style deli. To start, breath easy, because Lupe is still there, greeting you warmly as you walk in and making sure you find a seat. He's great. The menu has changed a bit, and there is a sports theme running through the menu and the decor. The new owners seem to be Mets fans, and my beau may or may not hold that against them. \n\nWe ordered  the L.E.O omelet (Lox, eggs, & onions) and the veggie skillet. They both came with a bagel and schmear, and the omelet also had a side of fruit.  Everything was freshly prepared to-order and came out quick. The staff was very accommodating when something came out wrong and quickly addressed our concerns. I greatly enjoyed the omelet - it was simple, and had the right proportion of lox to eggs. I might have peppered it up a bit more, but I like food with a kick. The veggie skillet was also very good - lots of potatoes, mushrooms, tomatoes, onions, peppers and cheese! You can order the skillet with any combo of veggies, meat, and cheese. Come hungry, because the skillet is a serious portion! The bagels and schmear are made in-house and are pretty good - not exactly like my favorite New York bagels, but a nice compromise. I do need to return to try the knish!\n\nI thought the prices were a bit steep for a delicatessen, but perhaps the prices go with the portion size. Some things seemed to be priced correctly or even slightly under-priced, like the skillets that come with a bagel, or the omelets that come with a bagel and side of fruit or potato ($10 or less). Other dishes, like the lox platter seemed a bit steep ($10.95). Then again, I'm not sure how much lox come with the platter, so maybe it's not such a fishy deal after all! I'll have to investigate the other menu items and do a little more price comparison to decide.\n\nOverall, JJ's is a welcome addition to the neighborhood and a great place to stop in for Sunday brunch, or any time you are craving some Jewish comfort food.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Forgive me for being gross, but I have to tell you my favorite way to judge a Jewish-style deli. It's by how much you enjoy the post-meal burps. And the new JJ's Delicatessen at Pinnacle Peak and Scottsdale Road rates high on the burp-o-meter!! It's been open since July in the spot once occupied by Kashman's. In my opinion, JJ's is much better. The service is lovely (a big change), the menu extensive, and the food delicious.\n\n     I ordered the signature sandwich, a \"Pnish\" ($8.95). It's a \"square potato knish sliced in half and filled with your favorite meat, cheese and dressing, then grilled panini style\". I chose corned beef, swiss cheese, and Russian dressing. For my included-in-the-price side, I got cole slaw. In general I'm not a great fan of knishes, but this one did make a great (and unusual) sandwich. The corned beef was a tad dry, but with Russian dressing and cole slaw, who'd notice? The cole slaw was fabulous; I appreciated its sweetness, and Ken its sourness. We both loved the freshness. All the salads are made daily. As are the breads and bagels. Ken had a cinnamon raisin bagel, which I, of course, tried. It was more dense than most Arizona bagels, and chewy, so it reminded me somewhat of New York bagels. Ken's fruit platter was quite large, and the fruit was ripe and tasty.\n\n     All the pastry looked delicious. We took home a chocolate horn and an apricot hamantaschan. Both were shockingly good. The hamantaschan dough was melt-in-your-mouth rich, and the tart filling was a pleasant contrast. The texture of the chocolate horn was perfect, it shattered when I bit into it, yet it wasn't dry. The chocolate had a good flavor. By the way, iced coffee goes perfectly with chocolate horns, and JJ's makes theirs using a cold drip method. I had ice tea with my sandwich, and it was excellent.\n\n     We're planning to try breakfast at JJ's. There's a huge variety of options including a L.E.O.($9.95), matzo brie ($8.95), and a whitefish salad platter ($10.95). Latkes and blintzes are both available at $10.95. Not cheap, but I bet there'd be enough to share.

They have 2 registers @ this deli (one on either side of the counter). Both had a single customer at them, next in line was the large family, and then there was me. \n\nBoth registers completed the orders with their single guests. I stood behind the large family for 2 or 3 minutes as they were really indecisive, it was the 1st time they'd been here for some of them, etc.  Neither of the cashiers bothered to call me forward to either open register. They both just stood there waiting for the large family? What the...... ?  \n\nFinally, getting frustrated and perturbed, I stepped forward and asked the matriarch of the family if it would be alright if I went ahead explaining that all I wanted was 2 bagels to go. How ridiculous that I'm just standing there waiting with 2 people available to help me.  They made no effort to do so.  She said that was totally fine so I approached one of the registers. \n\nThe little twerp looked annoyed with me from the get-go. It was like I was inconveniencing him trying to order something from this deli.  I felt as though he would rather have not bothered with me, and that he would have been more content with an empty register so that h could carry on a conversation with the other employees.\n\nAnyway, I order 2 bagels to go. Not difficult. I give him the first bagel order. Next I ordered the second.  \"You wanted it scooped, right, \" he asked me.  \"What?\" I asked.  \"I'm not sure what you said.\"  He repeated, \"Did you want that scooped?\"  I explained that I did not know what that meant. \n\nNext, this idiot says, \"But you asked for the first one scooped, right?\" Again, I explained to him that I had never even heard that term before so how could I have asked for that.\n\nLooking increasing annoyed, instead of asking me if I'd like something to drink, he just pointed @ the beverage cups.  What an asshole!!!  \n\nIf all of this isn't enough, after I paid him with my credit card, instead of saying thank you and handing me back my card, he just tossed my card down on the counter in front of me to give it back.

Since we were hungry when we got out, it was too convenient not to give J.J.'s another chance.  \n\nThis time, we walked in the door and nobody else was there.

Despite the mainstream disapproval of vegetarianism this place was really trendy, and still rides on its fame from the good old days.\n\nWe are lucky to have the number of vegetarian restaurants in Edinburgh that we do today. This, however, means more competition for Hendersons. Nonetheless it still remains probably the best known.\n\nI have mixed feelings about Hendersons however. On one hand it provides a great variety of generally good quality vegetarian food, on the other its pricey for what you pay for and the menu never really seems to change. It's a great shame that some of the other criticisms here have confused some generally bad experiences that could have happened at any restaurant, with the fact this restaurant just happens to be vegetarian. It's clearly fallacious to say that just because your cake wasn't creamy enough vegetarian restaurants must disapprove of creamy cakes. Any restaurant could serve you a disappointing flapjack. It reminds me of the sort of arguments you here from intolerant travellers when they are abroad and don't like something they've been served or whatever and equate it with something necessary about the culture or the people.\n\nThat aside Hendersons does have it downside. I love their chickpea and tomato stew, but it's not that special, it's something I cook all the time and don't expect to pay \u00a36 for it.

They do offer a student discount however.\n\nBut now let me defend Hendersons and say that the quality of the food, both nutritionally and taste wise, is still high above the average, and unlike most pubs or standard Italian restaurants, I don't feel like I owe my body an apology after eating there. I don't think that a slab of flesh maketh a meal (considering our bodies aren't made to eat meat with every meal and that 6-7% of the worlds population live without meat, through choice or circumstance, this claim seems ridiculous).\n\nI think to claim that Hendersons is a place that can be \"okay for some lifestyles but not for me really\" or \"not really my thing cos I eat meat\" is a claim from someone who hasn't tried the range of dishes available here, or has some problematic addiction to one particular food group (besides presumably these people don't literally eat meat with every single meal: breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacking- or they probably don't have much longer to live).

The food is usually good, often excellent, and the prices are far from unreasonable.  I have to say I prefer eating in the Bistro rather than the main restaurant downstairs as it has a warmer atmosphere, though you're paying a little more for your meal there.\n\nThe best part about it is that there is enough variety and flavour to please most non-vegetarians.  I've taken my mother and sisters there, my mother-in-law and my father, all of whom love their meat, but they've enjoyed the food.  Yes, I'm sure they would have preferred a nice steak, but while they might have gone in there a little apprehensive they came out satisfied and with no reservations about returning.\n\nThe shop is a little pricy, but let's face it, if you're vegetarian or vegan you're penalised wherever you go.  If you don't want to eat meat but still want a varied diet, you're going to have to pay for it.  The prices are comparable, or even cheaper, than the other main vegetarian stores in the city and the quality is always excellent.\n\nThis place holds a special place in my heart as it is where I took my wife for our first proper date, where I proposed to her and where we had our wedding reception, but that doesn't blind me to its imperfections.  Getting down the stairs to the toilets from the Bistro is a nerve-wracking experience, the main restaurant downstairs is often crowded and sometimes the staff can be a little hit and miss, particularly the younger workers.

That option would not load for us and after trying for a while we decided to just try the \"order now\" button. We had to put in all of our info first, then we got to see the menu. The menu was poorly edited and hard to read, not to mention confusing.

There were two options to select on the website to add the sandwich to the order, with exactly the same description, the only difference being one had \"Managers' Special\" in parenthesis. Not being able to discern the difference between the two I chose the latter and was later disappointed. My sandwich was literally 3 inches long, which is a shame because the three bites were pretty good.  The description said sprouts, avocado, tomato, and fresh greens among other things.  There were no sprouts, one slice of avocado, the butt end of one roma tomato and about five pieces of baby greens. I do have a positive though! For a side I had fruit salad, I really appreciated actual berries in the salad and not just melon like most places do. For paying over seven dollars I had expected a little bit bigger sandwich than kiddie size. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the small chicken pot pie and a roast beef sandwich. The sandwich was HUGE! Delicious roast beef with nice focaccia bread. The pot pie was sadly disappointing. It(the filling) came in a soup like cup, but with no pie. Instead they serve it with kind of like a small puff pastry tortilla. And it was so CHEESY which I really wish they would have put in the description because we aren't into cheese.

In the growing up years, Schlotzskys held a special place in my world.  Their bread was fresh, their toppings generous and the fact that they were one of the first restaurants to grill their sandwiches, they were unique.  From age 12-18, my birthday dinner desires were all fulfilled at Schlotzskys.\n\nFast-forward 2 decades...\n\nThe original sandwiches are still available.   The location in Tempe, unfortunately, is closed for a remodel.  Discovering this, I returned home to look up another location.  The tossup between 44th and Thomas and Warner and Alma School...!  As I'm at Baseline and Mill, the biggest consideration was traffic.  At 7 PM on a Tuesday, I figured the run east would be easier.\n\nI drove...and got to the store 7:20 PM.  On walking in, while the exterior of the location is kind of dark, the interior certainly works.  Recessed lighting, the feeling of faux rustic in appetite-stimulating colors...tables full of folks eating many discounted sandwiches...it felt like a good location for serious sandwich aficionados.\n\nWhen I got to the register, the guy before me had been courteously rejected when he asked to order 10 of the discount sandwiches to go.  In placing my order with the manager/owner? I requested 3 small originals (the offering advertised).  My preference for the jalapeno cheddar bread was greeted with an expression of relief.  Other customization: no lettuce, extra onion, extra olive and add jalapeno on each.  \n\n10 minutes later, my sandwiches are bagged and ready.  Driving home, the aroma of toasted bread and warm meat, along with savories tempted me to dig into the bag.  I resisted, as this was dinner for me and mine.  Arriving at home, I brought the conquest in.  \n\nUnwrapping the first, I observed no jalapeno or cheese on the bread.  On taking a bite, there was no indication of significant onion, olive or jalapeno.  Lowering the sandwich and taking the top off was a disappointment.  1 slice of tomato, a scattering of onion and olives, and no jalapeno.  The receipt showed the order correctly, but the end result did not match.\n\nAfter the unfortunate discovery, I called the restaurant.  As the person who answered had a very thick hispanic accent, I knew I was not talking to the manager/owner, who is working to lose her Brooklyn accent.  I asked for the manager, and on she came.  In advising the sandwiches are incorrect, she asked me to return the sandwiches...so she could make it right.  I advised that this would be 40 minutes round-trip, and I would not be back in the neighborhood until next week.  She suggested I freeze the incorrect product and bring it when I get into the neighborhood...she will make it right.\n\nI appreciate the effort to fix an order that's wrong...so I will return the remaining incorrect sandwiches.

The prices for their stuffed cabbage and other \"specialty meals\", as one reviewer put it, is not outrageous, but no bargain.  The stocked produce  (barszcz, pate, cheeses, sauerkraut, etc.) is more expensive than at Warsaw Village, sometimes by multiples.

Paired with red cabbage and spatzel.\"\n\nThe BF was torn between the Mixed Wurst Plate ($23), \"Bratwurst, Knackwurst, and Bockwurst.  Served on a bed of sauerkraut and mashed potatoes,\" and the Oktoberfest Platter ($25), \"A classic pork schnitzel and a jumbo Bratwurst paired perfectly with red cabbage and homemade spatzle.\"  He chose the former since I already had the pork schnitzel and spatzle in my dish.\n\nAs we waited for our entrees, bread and butter arrived with our beverages.  We also took a little walk through the market to check out their German groceries and deli.  A limited choice of food items, but you'll find your herring, spatzel, and sauerkraut available here for home.\n\nMy pork schnitzel was covered with dark brown gravy and was quite tender.  Pretty good.  The spatzel was okay, but maybe it's because I prefer it with a creamier sauce instead, like mushroom.  (I think I should have ordered the Kase Spatzle ($16), \"House recipe German noodles smothered with melted Swiss cheese.  Garnished with tomatoes,\" instead.)  The red cabbage was blah, nothing special but the side salad was pretty tasty.  \n\nThe BF's wurst feast came with a side of mustard sauce for dipping and a huge helping of sauerkraut.  The different wursts were pretty good and the sauerkraut was okay.  (Then again, I think I'm a fan of it on the colder end and crunchy than soggy.)\n\nThey were both very generous orders and we had leftovers to go.  We never made it to dessert which was \"Bavarian Apple Strudel with vanilla sauce\" ($7) and \"Black Forest Cherry Cake\" ($5).  \n\nOverall, Cafe Heidelberg may probably be more authentic German fare than Hofbrauhaus.  They were recently voted \"Best of Las Vegas\" for \"Other Ethnic Restaurant\" again.  So, if you want your German fix, head on over to Cafe Heidelberg, just don't expect the loud music, crazy games, and the long wait of its competitor.\n\n(I added pics of our dinner in the business profile!)", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 8, "cool": 6}}, {"text": "Loved this place a few years back when they had a Chef from the \"Fatherland\" cooking.

Walking into the place the staff was very friendly and helpful. I have high expectations of German food from a place i use to frequent back home and this was lacking in a few areas. As the dining room was kind of unwelcoming with the way it was setup with glass cases of countless items on display for sale. I feel like if im paying $30 a plate for dinner that i would like to eat in a dining room at the least, instead i felt like i was sitting in a pawn shop. Lets get to the food split pea soup was tasty, bread dumplings were just ok lacking in flavor a bit, the schnitzel was good no doubt and the spaetzle was just ok. The entire mean was kind of ho hum and nothing to really write home about, although i would have gone back except for what happen when i received my bill. \nI did what Restaurants.Com suggests in trying sides, and higher priced dishes because you have your gift certificate. This is where the extra split pea soup and dumplings are ordered which i wouldnt usually do because i already know my portion is going to be huge and fill me up. Most all certificates on Restaurants.Com suggest that anywhere from a 15-20% gratuity is auto added to your bill and i personally am not a fan of this as i should be able to tip my server based on performance and is partially why i even got the Cafe Heidelburg certificate in the first place. So a bill for dinner for two came out to $64 for dinner and two sides and that was AFTER the use of my $25 gift certificate.

That means that im almost at $90 total bill ($64 + $25= $89) to eat in a pawn shop, and have mediocre food at best.

Luckily, we had the salad to hold us over. To our surprise, our lunches came out first. We weren't particularly impressed with the sandwich as there was too much ham, and slightly a little brie. It tasted ordinary if you ask me. I then got the burger. The fries looked great--I think they were sprinkled with a little parmesan. Anyhow, after I took my first bite, the table noticed that my medium burger was anything but that. It was generally all pink inside and very unsuitable to eat. In retrospect, looking at the photo I took (see photos), you can see part of the bun is bloody!\n\nWe asked a server to come by to take a look and she seemed unfamiliar with how it should appear. We also took this time to ask our soup that never arrived. The waitress comes back and takes our semi eaten burger back to the restaurant. At this point, I am thinking, something MUST be comped.\n\nAs we are sitting there, a burger was served to another fellow who arrived way after we had. At last my burger comes, and its only decent. There is only a hint of truffle flavor in the burger (it was all in the mayo) but aside from this uniqueness, the rest of the burger was just your standard fare, nothing special about it. After these were all eaten up, our soup came out and we didn't get to truly appreciate it.\n\nThe bottomline... the hotel itself is very nice, too bad that it didn't expand into the doors of the hotel's deli.

The sandwich had a good flavor.  The bacon was not the best quality, but it was crispy and flavorful.  The lettuce was crisp and the mayo provided a creaminess to the sandwich.

Not to be confused with the Optical department.\nI will preface by saying that the Optical department is actually quite awesome!  They are fast and friendly, and quite knowledgeable.  No issues there!\nHOWEVER\nI made an appointment with the Optometrist department to have a check-up.  I happened to arrive really early, so I poked my head in to see if there was a possibility that they could take me sooner than my appointment, in hopes of saving their and my time.  Unfortunately I was huffed at by the oh-so-pleasant receptionist (I will discuss her in a moment), and told to come back at my scheduled time.  Fine, no problem to me, I'll just do some walking around inside Costco to kill time.\nSo I return to the Optometrist office - on time, mind you - and have the pre-test completed by the receptionist.  I'm not sure why they let her do it since she can't, or doesn't know how to do it right because she told me she'd have to get the Optometrist to do it for her.  Now the good part.  I'm inside the room getting my check-up, and the Optometrist puts some drops in my eyes at the end, and instructs me to wait five minutes in the waiting room and she'll bring me back in to finish up.  She brings me back in after five minutes, finishes up, and I'm good to go.  I get two steps outside the door when my husband, whom was accompanying me, told me that while I was being examined by the Optometrist, the receptionist was LISTENING TO OUR CONVERSATION WITH HER EAR PRESSED TO THE DOOR.  My husband was extremely uncomfortable with that, and he suggested to her to not listen to our conversation, and she blatantly replied, \"I am privileged to listen to their conversation\".  I turned right around and went back into the office and confronted the receptionist with this information, who admitted to having listened with her ear to the door.  WOW.\nI'd like to mention that her actions were likely due to the fact that she wanted to be done early as clearly displayed by her ear to the door (perhaps to see if we would be done soon?), lunch bag and purse neatly packed up sitting on top of the desk, tapping her nails, and my husband said the driver of her ride (waiting outside) had come in and checked to see if she would be done soon.  \nPlease think twice before using the Optometrist office!

I meant that except for one employee.  Guess who that employee is?  Oh it's the GM!! That woman is a B rhymes with witch. I was in utter shock when I found out that this unpleasant individual was the GM!! \n\nScenario: I ordered a strawberry banana smoothie for my person. It's a Saturday at noon.  The bagel pickings were slim and they still have four more hours until close. Is anyone making bagels?  Bueller? Bueller? The associate starts to make the smoothie and realizes oh there are no bananas. Who used the last banana? Hint: whoever used the last banana could have said \"Hey we are out of 'naners!\" And someone could have WALKED across the parking lot to Albertsons to get more because not sure if anyone read the beverage menu board but STRAWBERRY BANANA SMOOTHIE is a prominently displayed drink choice. You need bananas for that and conveniently a grocery store is right there, like right there!!! My person doesn't want just a strawberry smoothie or a mixed berry smoothie. So I asked to just get a refund. They call over the person eating their lunch in the store which brings me to, hey you are kind of busy, think you can jump in and help instead of stuffing your face ignoring the fact that there is a line??? This person (a woman) goes to give me change and I said wait can't you put it back on my card? I paid with a credit card. She says oh I forgot to ask you if you wanted it on your card but I already did it and I am going to give you change. So I asked her if she would put it on my card since that is an option. She sighed very heavily, rolled her big, stupid eyes at me and went on to charge me for another drink on my card and had to void that one plus return the first one. In my head I was thinking, if this place wasn't around the corner and if everyone wasn't so nice I'd never come here again if this were my first time here. I didn't know that was the GM, they went and sat back down after \"helping, not helping\" me. I was appalled, there was still a line and cream cheese tubs in a bus bucket teetering on the cooler edge that needed to be put out and displayed, but they got busy and the employee doing that task jumped behind the counter to HELP. You'd think the GM (who I didn't know was the GM at the time) would maybe take the what 3 minutes it would take to put them away instead of sitting back down to eat? \n\nI went in today and the nice manager with the long blonde pony tail, I wish I knew her name...was there.  I thought she was GM she's always helpful and pleasant and I wanted her to know, listen you have a manager here who isn't exactly welcoming, you need to coach her on her people skills because if I wasn't a regular and didn't know that it's normally a pleasant experience here, I'd never come back.  She told me that woman was the GM. My mouth involuntarily fell open in shock. I couldn't believe it. The GM is acting like that? Wow. And I noticed a we're hiring sign on the window.  It makes me wonder who would want to work for this woman? Are they having a hard time keeping employees? If you treat a customer like she did me and she thought that was acceptable behavior what does she treat her employees like. I felt bad for the entire staff.\n\nI hope the GM sees this. (Maybe customer service is not your forte...or maybe you need to work very hard on your people skills, I get the impression you are new, if you need some coaching on how to deal with people please respond to my review and I will be happy to set up a time to get together to go over basic customer service behaviors with you.

Glazier's was very competitive, especially for not being a corporate giant.  Okay, back to the review, the store boasts a coffee shop, hand dipped ice cream, made to order asian dishes including sushi, hot rotisserie chicken, self-serve fountain drinks, self-serve olive bar, self-serve salad bar with most of the fixings ($6.88 per lb.), and a small dining area equipped with a piano.  The salad bar really won my heart!  I was raised in PA where nearly every grocery store had a self-serve salad bar; when we moved out here, to my chagrin, the only grocery store to offer this was Whole Foods--bleh.  Not to knock WF but, I'm really not into paying more for organic foods--they taste the same and I can clean/wash my meats/produce.  Besides, even though organic produce is grown w/o pesticides, don't you still wash it before eating it--duh!  \n\nWhoa deli!!!!  Ahh, deli...cious.  Well staffed.  Like most newer grocery stores, this deli also hosts a computerized ordering kiosk so the impatient can shop for other stuff while their order is being filled.  The kiosk shows the price per lb. of the item you select, allows you to select the weight desired, and allows you to specify how you'd like your meats/cheeses cut (ex. shaved, chipped, sliced, thick, thin, very thin, massacred (j/k).  The deli case has a very nice variety of specialty meats and cheeses, mostly consisting of the brand Boars Head.  I usually do not buy this brand because it's too expensive but at Glazier's, it's actually affordable!  At Vons, I pay up to $6-7 lb. for American cheese; Glazier's, Boars Head American cheese was $5.07 lb., and it wasn't even on sale.  For all of you PA/NJ/NY'ers they sell Taylor's Pork Roll at the deli!!!!!!!!!!!!!  If you turn your fanny away from the deli case there sits a few refrigerated islands stocked with just about any kind of gourmet cheeses you could fathom.\n\nMoving on...meat.  The meat case looked incredible!  Everything looked fresh and well-presented.  I was hoping they'd carry USDA Prime cuts but only carry USDA Choice (like all other grocers).  Prices of the case items where on par with other grocers.  In the pre-packaged case, again the meats looked FRESH!!!  I was quite impressed.  In fact I was so impressed with the aesthetics of the meat in the pre-packaged section that I almost bought a pack of hamburger and a pack of chicken.  It took a minute or so to settle down.  My impulsion didn't get the best of me, phew.  For goodness sakes, what the heck do I need more chicken and beef for, I have a bunch in the freezer.  So just a fair warning to all who go by the meat section, don't get too impulsive--you're just browsing!  By the way, ground beef and chicken prices are very reasonable!  So sorry to all of the Yelpers who are interested in seafood, mama don't play that game.\n\nBoxes, and cans, and bottles, oh my!!!!  FYI, Glazier's seems to carry two \"house\" brands: Smithfield and Western Family.  For nearly every brand name item they carry, there's at least one \"house\" brand.  Some product prices that really jumped out at me will be listed:\nGOOD BUYS (non-sale items)\nAndersen's Butter (under $2 lb), dozen large eggs (under $1.20), bottled juices (under competitor's prices), Mrs. G's bread ($1.18)\nBAD DEALS (non-sale items, lol)\nCoke and Pepsi (over $1.50 for a two-liter), Campbell's soups ($1.09-1.99 a can), Tony's Pizza (over $3), Totino's Pizza (over $1.75)\n\nAs far as paper products, detergents, soaps, and cosmetics, I didn't get a chance to shop around, though I did notice a nice selection.\n\nOverall, I think anyone who tries Glazier's out will be impressed with what they find.

There is a HUGE opportunity for Glaziers here and I would really love to see them expand on this section and add a little variety and imagination.\n\nThe food court is of average quality - the Pizzas look fantastic and are good, if a little soggy (although I think that's generally how NY style pizza is - In my opinion the tip of a slice of pizza should not sag to point straight at the ground when you pick it up). Again, some variety here would really add to things.\n\nGlaziers - you have my attention. You are an excellent step away from the depressingly generic supermarkets that plague The United States.

Midgets with ponytails, a one armed man juggling Faberge eggs, and a sober Lindsay Lohan at a PTA meeting stroking  the head of her child who isn't retarded or born addicted to cocaine.

I once was asleep on a raft in the middle of the Indian ocean and on the third day I dreamed that I was taking a shower in stardust and soaping up Judith Light, not now Judith Light, but second season of Who's the Boss Judith Light...I am not that sick. When I was living in Pago Pago for a few months while on the run from Romanian VCR smugglers, I dreamed that I was being smothered by a giant coconut with a needle stuck in it...long story.  Lastly when I was...um...in college (for 11 years after good behavior deductions)...I dreamed of supermarkets. Standing in front of the commissary staring at Pall Mall, Marlboro and 2 kinds of spam your mind races, your heart yearns and  your bowels release at the thought of a fully stocked supermarket.\n\nIn Las Vegas the only time your bowels release is if you dare to eat the \"manager's special\" meats at Smith's...hell if you even touch it you feel a dribble...or leakage if you prefer. Smith's you don't dream of unless you hate humanity. Albertson's you don't dream of unless you dream of gouging humanity. Von's...maybe...if you dream low.  No, you dream of Glazier's Food Marketplace.  \n\nThe first thing that Glazier's is that it is clean. It is exceptionally clean. I would lick the floor, not that I wouldn't most places, but this one wouldn't send me to the hospital. It was strange being in Las Vegas and seeing such a clean store. It is Las Vegas. Las Vegas is either beautiful, clean, new and sexy...or dirty, disgusting, usually high on meth and on the verge of collapse...thankfully Glazier's is the former.  Glazier's is the sponsor to Smith's dirty disgusting, homeless drug addict. You have seen them in NA. Glazier's is all clean, reciting the steps, he has an inspirational story to tell. Smith's is eating flies off of their shirt and sweating profusely. \n\nNext thing you notice about Glazier's is that it is cheap. Not like Von's where the specials are cheap and the rest is very expensive. Glazier's special are great and their normal prices are excellent. It has the price point of Smith's without the chance of hepatitis or food poisoning. \n\nNow look around and see all of the different sections for you to peruse... Seafood section, deli, butcher, bakery, pizza place, fresh sushi, and on and on. The sushi is better than Whole Foods or Trader Joe's and a much better price. The fish is fresh and it tastes really great.  The baked breads are very good, the donuts are amazing and the pastries are great.  They also import baked breads, cheesecakes from Carnegie Deli and other great items from quality vendors.  They have a sausage factory...okay...read that again...SAUSAGE FACTORY. I am not talking about Cherry on a Saturday night...I am talking about real sausage. \n\nThe fruit and vegetable selection is excellent, it is cheap and it is fresh. I bought vine ripened Beefsteak tomatoes for .88/lb. Outstanding. Bought some great oranges, mushrooms, and scallions.  \n\nLastly, for all of you have done time...I mean spent time...in the East cost you know that there is only one good sweet treat...and virtually no one has it in Las Vegas.  Tastycakes. Yes, dear reader...Tastycakes. They are the best desert a human being can buy. Glazier's has them because they have an east coast history.\n\nIf you like good food.

Normally 80% lean for under two dollars. Seafood section if great as well. Only complaint I would have is they don't always know how to cook some of the fish but I have only had that happen once. Never trying to cook flounder again. I haven't tried thier deli meat yet. \n\nPremade salads are very yummy as well. My favorite is the macaroni. Made fresh daily I think. You can try any of thier salads if you ask . I always attempt to try a new one when ever I go in. Only one i havent liked and gotten yet is the pesto salad. I am not a big pesto person but for pesto it wasn't bad. The olive bar and fresh salad bar are out standing. I get the salad or pizza for lunch all the time.

If you really pay attention to some of the foods they have here, you can see labels that say \"REQUESTED ITEM\" and there are tons of those.

Glazier's makes me feel like a thief! I've concluded that you should only shop here if you want to be made to feel like a second class citizen or shoplifter.

Great produce and while it's too expensive for everyday grocery shopping, the wide aisles and wide assortment make it fun to look around. \n\nOf course, one dissatisfied customer is worse than having 100 happy customers because, believe me, I am going to share this story with everyone I know.

Walking towards the back there is a bakery to your left, a full service deli salad counter to your right, a huge sausage ad meats counter in the back with all kinds of fresh cuts.

To order your sandwhich meats and cheeses you first walk up to a kisok, choose what you want as much as you like, touch the screen to submit your order and it prints you out a reciept to take along with an order number and you can choose to have it text you when your order is complete! If you decide to wait while they work, there are screens that tell you which of the four stations are working on your order and you can watch your meats sliced fresh! It's nice for busy people to not have to wait at the counter all night on someone that has no idea what they want, because the most time consuming part of the process is moved out to a kiosk. Best idea ever in a grocery store. That wraps up the open market syle area with classy neon signs along the walls and a seating area with a live piano playing while you have a bite to eat.\n\n     As you go down the rest of the grocery isles, you can tell there is a much wider selection of things you wouldn't find in a typical grocery store. All kinds of specialty items so unique, and hard to find, like chocolate soda lol. The prices on some of these things are a little higher than other stores, but you cannot beat the prices they have on fresh food. Glazier's has rows and rows of fresh, in-house prepaired food for you to take home and use or finsh. Their pastries section is unrivaled in selection and price.

When you do go, be sure to leave yourself plenty of time to wonder through the store. You are guranteed to find something you will love, but giver yourself the time to see it all. We didn't have enough time to take it all in, though I already can't wait to go back and check it out again. It's 24 miles from my house in Centennial Hills but plan on making the trip frequently as I know it will be worth it. This city is lucky to have such a wonderful, local store to shop for food. This is a very unique place and everyone in this city is missing out if you don't go.

Thinking it being a New York style pizza, you'd think \"thin crust\". Not really. The dough is pretty tough, not flaky crispy. If I saved this pizza for leftovers, when it cools I'm going to play Frisbee golf. And the instructions you get on the pizza only states, \"Preheat oven to 350F\". That's it. It doesn't tell you how long to actually bake it for. The marinara sauce was alright. I would say that was the only good thing about the pizza. I got the cheese pizza because the pepperoni pizza only had maybe 10-12 pepperonis. It just didn't look like enough pepperoni. So got the pepperoni individually.

I didn't take the time to write down everything I saw but I could easily come up with a 30 item list where prices are 30 to 35 cents higher for the same items, some things were over $1 more, and I saw some items that I can get way cheaper elsewhere in Vegas saving $3 or more per item.

They have good sales like peppers (red, yellow, orange and green) for .88/ cents a pound. They have 10 limes for a dollar. They have a package of small heirloom tomatoes for $1 (in the summer). Sometimes it is bad when they have a whole area of avocados and not one is ripe. Or the fact that their herbs arent very good.\n\n2. Their deli and prepared meals section is fantastic. I really enjoy the fact that I can order with my phone or in the little kiosk. The problem is that the cheapest sliced meat they offer is $8.99/lb WOW. They have fantastic cheese and  they have almost anything you could want.\n\n3. Meat area. They usually have a great variety of prepackaged meats at a reasonable price. The only problem with the meat section is the rude customer service. I ordered some bacon the other day and the guy behind the counter didn't say a single word to me. He was also preoccupied with staring at the front of the store/door area. It was strange. \n\nFYI I got food poisoning from here recently from the bacon!! I have also had a couple friends have food poisoning from their bacon and salad bar! Buyer/ eater beware!!\n\n4. Customer service. This is where they lose a whole star for me. Usually they are super friendly. If you want them to carry a new item you go to customer service and ask for it and they 90% of the time will start to carry it (which is why they have such a large variety of food).\n\nThe negative is that there are a couple of girls who are completely rude. For example, I was buying forumla and had a manufactuer's coupon (which is NOT a check, it is a COUPON) it had my husband's name on it and the girl told me I will not take that. I asked her why and she said you are trying to cash a check with someone else's name on it and I will call the cops to have you arrested if you try again. UM WHAT!

Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting service like I was in a 5 star hotel - but I've been in retail for 20 years and a manager for 12+ years...and believe the employees' demeanor and behaviors are just a indicator of how the business is run. Just my two cents on that. \n\nI ended up buying shrimp, donuts, fritters, chips and other goods totaling almost $60. For lunch, I stopped at the sushi counter and the lady was probably the friendliest employee I encountered. I was interested in buying some seafood and meat, but once I got to the butcher station, the lady behind the counter was so consumed in whatever task she was doing that she never even looked up to ask if I needed help. At the checkout counter, the cashier was nice enough, but honestly, I've received friendlier service at Wal-Mart. During my transaction (it was a debit), the register timed out and I had to repeat my transaction. I asked the cashier, \"So, the other transaction won't count?\" Defensively, she replied that it wouldn't. The only reason why I asked her was because where I work, if the register times out during a debit transaction, it sometimes WILL take the sale so I wanted to make sure. I was taken aback that she got so defensive as if I was attacking her cashiering expertise. \n\nI ate at their little sitting area and enjoyed my sushi lunch which tasted absolutely delicious. During my lunch some head honcho/corporate looking people were around me and half the time I thought, \"Manage your people, not the product and perhaps you'll see an increase in profits.\" \n\nFor the items I purchased: 5 stars. \nFor not even being said hello to: 0 stars. \nFor the cleanliness and organization of the store: 4 stars. \nFor the price differential in items: 1 star (certain items were priced reasonably and certain items were just way overpriced). \nFor the lackluster customer service: 1 star (only because the sushi lady was actually nice). \n\nAND on top of that, I nearly got run overed by some chick driving way to fast in the parking lot even though I was walking IN THE GD CROSSWALK and I had right of way. \n\n\nOh wait, the bouncer/security guard guy at the door - - seriously?!!? If you're going to park someone over there, then at least have that person say, \"Have a great day\" WHILE LOOKING IN MY SHOPPING CART. (I know that's what you're doing - - checking if I stole anything.) \n\nGlazier's management: you have a beautiful store with great product in it - but I think you need to revisit the customer service piece of it too. \n\nI'd only come back if I was on that side of town. I'll save my gas and more money by going to Winco.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "How about that?!? After the cashier assured me that my debit card WOULD NOT BE charged twice, I find that it did in fact get charged twice (posted to my account the next day). \n\nI know registers \"time out.\" I've been there, done that. I work in retail and it has happened so I know for a fact THAT IT WILL CHARGE THAT PERSON TWICE. She didn't offer to call and supervisor or manager, but against my better judgment, I left. \n\nI filed a dispute with my bank and hopefully my money will be returned to me in a timely manner. \n\nGlazier's management: Ensure that your cashiers are properly trained to handle all types of situations - and if they cannot, give them the tools necessary to ensure that customer satisfaction is their top priority. I chose not to call your establishment because I felt that if you didn't care if I shopped in your store, then you wouldn't care if you gave me back my $60.

IT'S a VALID CONCERN\n\nYesterday was one of those days, I was fuming with Glazier's market!\nHere's what happened:\nI ordered a baby shower cake 2 days in advance. I knew there would be a problem...the person taking the order had no clue how to take it. I thought, I will call to be sure but I didn't. I paid, I left a phone number, gave the person my order, it's a half vanilla sheet cake, that says \"congrats...\"in hot pink with gerber lillies. Main thing I paid, I gave them time, and easy instruction.\n\nDay of the shower (two hours before), go in and there is NO CAKE. They never called, the asked me if I had a copy of what looked like an official form. I had no clue what they were talking about, I had a receipt with a bright orange sticker that said PAID. I guess this was not enough. \n\nTherefore, the cake for some reason, I never knew why was never made. So I picked one from the cold case (who by the way the person who took my order said, they often stay in there for up to 2 weeks because they forget to take them out...but nonetheless the young man said, \"they are still really good\") so now, I  pick a blue one out of the cold case...it has some pink in it (a shower for a GIRL)....and I am fuming! Another person comes out with 4 small packages, I thought they were happy meal toys and asked me if I wanted one. 'WTH are they?' I ask. These people don't talk. As a consumer, I have NO CLUE what is happening in this business transaction. Oh, well thank you....they are tiny baby shoes that can top the cake....that do not match, that look like they are from 1907. Thank you, thank you very much. My last comments are WHO IS THE MANAGER? The mute attendant (someone with a grey bob hair cut) says of course by pointing was the person who offered me the Happy Meal toys without telling me what they were but by just handing out 4 plastic whatevers...\n\n\nI take the cake and go fuming out assuring them I WILL CALL MONDAY WHEN I HAVE TIME. \n\nAlas, I take the stupid mismatched cake (that could be two weeks old) to the car. I need to buy soft drink, wine (yes, wine!) and a $50 gift card for the party and don't want to take the cake while shopping. Heavens, hey may think I am stealing it even though I have official documentation.\n\nI get 6 bottles of wine...I notice the 9.95...they are all 5 something...they have no idea where the gift cards are, They have no idea why the sales price isn't coming up. They are slow and confused. My blood is boiling, my heart is racing, I'm about to sweat and literally my always happy face has melted into a frown. \nI can't take it...I am done and I leave, bursting out the door.\n\nLet me say not only did these people make me late for a baby shower I was hosting, they wasted MY TIME. All of the occurrences could have been avoided by 1. Training the kid who took my order properly 2. Called me when they had a question about my order 3. Spoke to me about why the order did not get made instead of just staring at me like I had a 3rd eye and I didn't have the right to be angry...especially when I had to  look the case alone looking for a similar cake flavor like the one I ordered. And no they didn't have it so I had to pick something else! \n\nVery disappointing since I just bought a new home by this place. Admittedly Vegas doesn't have much to offer in the way of fresh produce and a store that has decent pricing for the good quality such as Whole Foods. They also have a salad bar there which is great and that I ate from when I ordered my cake (THAT WAS MY FIRST TIME THERE). As well as I bought a scoop of gelatto (that was ok.....but I ate it). I am a family person who does not need reasonable pricing - that they do seem to have. In addition, I need time a feature many families can lack. I am mad that they wasted mine and didn't even flinch or respond or take ownership of THEIR FAULT.\n\nI assure you people will continue to go there because they have some nice features to their store but I think it'll be the last they see of me.\n\nMonday mornings, I am bestowed at my front door with fresh milk, a  produce box, and meats that is delivered by Winder Farms. THOSE PEOPLE ARE FANTASTIC and for this I AM LOYAL. Still. I do shopping when I need things but this WILL NOT be the place to do it....\n\n\nYou lost a fine customer Glaziers, you really did.

Putting large orange stickers that read \"paid\" on any non bagged items so the Gestapo can verify that the item was indeed paid for.\nFurthermore, they force you to leave any backpacks with them, now I ride a motorcycle and as such use a backpack to carry my items back home. I understand that for them allowing me too keep it on carries some risk but with cameras watching the isles and the relative difficulty to stash something in a bag on your back compared to say... a purse.

We promptly received our meals, and were genuinely surprised about both the quality and quantity of the food! Each meal was nicely proportioned, and came with a choice of sides, which we got potato salad (Not that good). My sandwich was tremendous, as was my dad's burger, so we opted to split ours and share them. The Sandwich was tasty, although I wouldn't get it again, and the burger was delicious, as it was served on what seemed to be a round slice of challah.

However, they let me in on a little secret, if you come at 7:30, they will give you however many and whichever bagels you want, for FREE!

Not rocket science. \n\nThen came the drama of getting the bill. The woman at the counter was going on and on to a customer about the woes of AMEX fees. Yes...they are high...you can choose not to accept AMEX cards. I was going to use my AMEX but decided against it. After a 20 min wait for food I had no patience to listen to a tirade against a credit card company. She asked me what I had. I said \"Oatmeal and Fruit.\" She rang me up at $5.95. I paid, left a tip and was ready to gather my items when suddenly she wails...\"That's not it! You got the fruit plate...that's more!\" I ask her how much I owe.

Thick steel cut oats and brown sugar in a milky concoction. They redeemed themselves just slightly. Maybe they deserve another try.\n\nThey are a local, family owned restaurant and serve lots of interesting and traditional items...I mean, how many Jewish places are there in town to eat at right? But they need to get their act together. Most customers don't really want to know your gripes with credit card processors and don't need to wait 20 min to get oatmeal and then wait another 5 min for them to perform simple math. \n\n I thought Red Velvet Cafe was slow on the service but these guys are probably a little worse.

And let's see, the slaw was mushy, the whitefish a bit too fishy, and the platter veggies were way too thick for easy eating.\n\nI didn't sample a whole lot from their deli counter, but it looked well provisioned and the chocolate covered macaroons incredibly so. I did get a dozen bagels, and when I got to twelve, waited to see if they give out a Baker's Dozen. Indeed they do. Always a nice touch.\n\nAs an aside, i did manage to get into some trouble while there. You see, there was this cute, little chick who kept eyeballing me, So I'd wink and she'd smile and well this went on until my wife BUSTED me. Flat cold. Mid-wink.

And then she adds, \" Why she's not even a year old and she's little angel\" and then she vaults into a chat with the mother and grandmother and auntie. \n\nMan, that was close!\n\nSo my vote goes to stopping in if you're in the vicinity, but not put them on any culinary bucket list.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 8, "useful": 7, "cool": 4}}, {"text": "Levy's is probably my favorite Jewish deli in Las Vegas.

Rex will bless you like he did those thousands of people when he was pretending to be an Archbishop.  You tell one priest that you aren't into Altar Boys...BOOM...defrocked. Rex would have been pissed if Rex wasn't melting down candelabras and turning them into Iphone parts.  All good things must come to an end...soon Rex was roaming the countryside...the cities...the beaches...the dumpsters of the Northeast. From Maryland to Maine Rexy was a seeker...a poet (Roses are Red...Violets are Purple...this doesn't rhyme F U!)...a part time amateur dentist...and full time stud.  These were great days. Rex was alive. Rex was kept by chubby women looking to \"work off\" the winter weight. Rex for 3 days was Chief of Thoracic Surgery at Mass General...until he threw up inside a heart transplant patient.  It was during this time Rex fell in love. Twice. First was with \"Three Eyed\" Karen. Oh, how I miss Three Eye...looking into her blue eyes...and the one weird grey one on her neck.  The second was bagels.\n\nTo people outside of the Northeast they just don't understand the beauty and wonder that a great bagel can provide.  The perfect bagel is slightly crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. It can be served as is or sliced and toasted. It can hold butter, cream cheese, lox, cold cuts...almost anything. The only incredible sadness of great bagels is that one day later you have a hockey puck...or you need to slice them thin and bake them to make chips. Still...for that one day. That one great day. You have a circle of perfection that makes that wedding ring on your finger seem more stupid and meaningless than you already know it does.   \n\nAs with most foods in Vegas it is very, very tough to find a great example of a food delicacy.  For about 3 years Rex \"Bagel Genitals\" Marvin refused to even buy bagels in this town. Rex denied a part of himself...much like he did for those 6 years he didn't buy Donna Summer commemorative plates. Oh...the dark years...so dark...so cold. Rex digresses...Rex sobs...Rex moves on...no bagels for Rex for 3 years...until...a very good friend, Dr. Slash \"Degree from Antarctica\" McCutter, invited him to discuss his latest...um...troubles...to Levy's Bagels and Deli.  Rex reluctantly ate the bagle handed to him, an Everything...after explaining to Dr. Slash that he would end up tied down naked in an ape habitat after giving the apes Viagra, Monster and more Viagra...after seeing the small smile on his face as he protested his fate...and then begged me to do it...Rex was worried about the quality of Levy's. From the first bite all those great memories of eatin bagels with Three Eyed Karen came rushing back. Rex was home...and not the home where had his hand broken for giving the thumbs up to his drain cleaning fourth step-father...oh no...this was the good home...where he tied down his fifth step-father and had a large neighbor lady with horrible gas pains treat him to the sounds of the musical fruit...for 5 hours. Ah...good times.\n\nLevy's bagels were perfect. Rex went on to try several other flavors all were very good. The best savory being the Onion and the Everything. The garlic needed more garlic and the Poppy was never a favorite of Rex's.  The best sweet was by far the Cinnamon Raison, while the Blueberry was good but not great.  \n\nThe real revelation was the rest of the menu. First THEY MAKE THEIR OWN CREAM CHEESE! For those of you who never had homemade cream cheese you will never eat that store crap again. You will use it for grout in your tub. Second, the Challah bread French toast was great and the stuffed Challah bread French toast was even better!  The omelets were good, the pancakes were good. Rex has never been there for lunch but the breakfast food are excellent. \n\nThe bad...good portions, not great, good specials but nothing that made me have to come back for a good deal, and the waitress service was a little slow. Sadly, the Knishes are frozen and brought in...and they taste it. Lose it from the menu or make it fresh. The Lox, which I think was brought in wasn't great, and if it is made in house...not good. A great Jewish deli has great Lox. Period.\n\nAll in all...it is a great place for bagels and breakfast.

For $11.99 I was hoping for a large sandwich overflowing with lobster. Instead I got what amounted to a 5 or 6 inch sub with a decent, but not mind-blowing, amount of lobster. I devoured it in a couple minutes and it still left me hungry. It's also served with fries (which were delicious) and cole slaw.\n\nThey do get extra points for making a half sandwich for my son (for $3.59) even though they don't have a kids menu.

In a bind, a bagel and cream cheese from here is fine, keeps my stomach from growling, but if I had another option within a five minute walk of my office I'd take it.

And why do I go back?\n\nI guess the answer to the first question lies in the fact that I go to Einstein's expecting to be treated like an individual ordering MY individual bagel, with MY individual tastes at least somewhat considered. The very first time I had Einstein's was at this location on Maryland Parkway, in fact, I've never been to another Einstein's, so my impression of this franchise is based solely off this one location. \n\nI have never ordered one of their bagel sandwiches. I have always ordered bagels with cream cheese, or as they like to refer to it \"spread\". The first time I ordered here I realized when they put cream cheese on a bagel they PUT CREAM CHEESE on a bagel. It's more cream cheese than bagel. Lesson learned - ask for less spread.\n\nI have been back multiple times and I have always asked for LESS SPREAD. Yet constantly my bagel comes to me smeared and over-loaded with spread. Maybe I'm asking too much? But come on! I believe once I ordered the bagel with the spread on the side. Now thank goodness, that's a good idea because then these over-zealous bagel ruiners don't get a chance to get their cream cheese explosion guns all over my poor little bagel. \n\nNow to answer question number two. Why do I go back? I guess it's because of the *bagels*. They have a great selection and the bagels themselves are delicious. I also enjoy the fact that you can order a coffee and go back to refill it as many times as you please. The fact that it is at least somewhat close to where I live is convenient for me. \n\nBut... still, when a customer asks for less spread and I don't get it, that's unacceptable. There are three people working behind the counter typically. The person who takes the order should be able to communicate to the other employees what the customer wants. I suspect there may be a break-down in the communication here. Because if I ask for somethin specifically and the person taking the order even repeats it back to me correctly... what happened in between the time I placed the order and I received it?\n\nBut I digress.

Went downstairs to the Pellegrino Pizza & Deli beacuse I read a good review about the pizza. Then I changed my mind and bought a hamburger. Best decision I've ever made in Vegas! I didn't tell them how I wanted it so, the burger was cooked medium-well. The size was a normal 1/4lb. Didn't seem like much for a $6 burger but the taste was excellent! Fresh lettuce and tomatoes on a grilled bun, with pickle and carrot spears on the side. French fries would have been another $4 so I upgraded to the $5 onion rings. Another best decision! Big fluffy battered 'rings dipped in bbq sauce. All cooked perfectly, none were burned. So, basically, I paid the typical $12 for a casino burger but I got one of the best fast-food meals ever in this town. Other places want you to care more about the burger's size rather than it's falvor. Pellegrino decided to emphasize quality over quanity, and I couldn't have been more satisfied. The only drawback is that I went there alone. While the burger was normal size, the basket of onion rings was large enough to be shared. I almost cried when I threw away the leftover 'rings but I just couldn't eat them all. The pizza slices looked like what I normally see in my home town but, of course, I wasn't able to taste them.

Seriously, this is the most amazing pie crust, light, flaky, moist, *sigh* I just wish I could better explain how good the crust was on the chocolate cream pie.  I didn't have to scoop the cream because every bite of perfect crust and chocolate just melted in my mouth.  And for a mini pie at $3.89, this is a bargain.  Most whole pies here are under $10 and worth at least twice that much.  I also brought home a chicken pot pie and for someone who would only eat the chicken filling, I thought the crust was the best part of it.  Compared to the crust, I found the chicken and veggies to be a little bland.   I would buy it again just for the crust, and try the turkey pot pie instead.\n\nI just did carry out, but they have a nice little seating area, sandwiches, salads, soups and quiche.  If those items are even half as good as the pies you are in for a treat.  I also brought home a blueberry cobbler.

I took my delicious morsals home and popped the chicken pot pie in the oven.  About 20 minutes later it was done.  This beats any frozen Marie Callander's pot pie any day!

I'm not that picky on that. The home fries weren't hot either which was a disappointment, because I know potatoes hold their heat very well. Anyways, aside from the warm, not hot, food it tasted pretty good. Eggs were done just to my liking. The turkey sausage was fantastic and had a perfect texture. There are two types of turkey sausage, the smoked sauage that comes in a long link (hot dog texture) and the shorter links with a more ground beef texture (and also apparently patties like they had here). It was seasoned well, cooked well, and the texture was just perfect. The home fries were good and also had a nice texture, there was some crispiness to it, but at the end all I really had left was extra crispy chips.\n\nGiven my experience, I can only do a 3-star.

I swear I was on the cusp of tears after the first bite.  I know I was starving when I ate, but they were just genuinely fantastic.

The roast beef was nice and rare, and the sandwich was overall quite tasty. It was pretty loaded down with meat, which helps against the $9 cost. That $9 is about on par with Chompie's, who sells a sandwich loaded with even MORE meat for about $11 and a half for $8.\n\nThe fries were decent, but definitely of the frozen variety, so nothing to sneeze at there. My friend had the pastrami on onion roll and seemed to enjoy it. He also took down a chocolate milkshake and a slice of chocolate cake that was massive and dense in a way few cakes I've tried are.

(Not the only incidence of this happening.)\n-We observed two other tables of business casual individuals leave before their food had a chance to arrive, for (what we can only assume was) the same reason that we had to.\n-The hostess had to ask a four-top of people that already had drinks and some food to move to a different location in the restaurant in order to accommodate another party that just entered.\n-People began to pile up at the door to be seated and had to wait it out. Some just left.\n-The hostess began seating people with the warning that \"The kitchen is like, really, super backed up right now, so it'll be like, 30-40 minutes to get your food. Is that okay?\" (Would have been nice to get that warning and avoid the experience.)\n-The wait staff just kind of ran around like (well-intentioned) chickens with their heads cut off.

It tasted, I guess, a bit old. Home fries were really good had sauteed onion. \n\nNow on to the real issue..two tables\nNext to us were ready whispering (complaining). Made me wonder. Guess the server forgot to add sausage but assured him it would be ready when his pancakes were. Guess what! Pancakes came out but the sausage didn't. Owner came and rectified the situation.

I'm a fan of always giving new places a try, so while my coworker and I were looking for a place to eat today we decided to stop in and check it out. \n\nThe inside still looks like a Village Inn. I think they might've painted a bit, but the booths and fixtures are all old and you can tell they've been there for a while. But that's not a big deal, after all, I've eaten quality food at far worse looking restaurants. \n\nThe waitresses were all very friendly and we were seated promptly. I was surprised by the large selection of items on the menu. They had the full gambit from a variety of breakfast offerings to a ton of different sandwiches and dinner entr\u00e9es as well. \n\nI figured since this is a deli I would base my first judgement on the quality of their sandwiches. I ordered the Ham Feast sandwich. The bread was fresh, the bacon was cooked perfectly and the tomato was ripe. The flavor of the Ham was very good and high quality. Overall the sandwich was very good. I was a little worried that $10.50 was too much for a sandwich, but I wasn't at all disappointed by the quality or freshness. The fries that were served with the sandwich were thick and very fresh. Nice and crisp just like a French fry should be. \n\nI'm interested in trying their breakfast fare as it seemed like they have some really good options. \n\nThe atmosphere was a little bit stale for my tastes. They were playing some old school rat pack type stuff. That along with the old interior made the place much more suited for the older person type crowd. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but if you're expecting a jasons deli type of contemporary atmosphere, this place doens't have it. \n\nOverall, I give the place 4 stars because the food was great, and I just haven't had the chance to sample the rest of their menu yet. I'll hold out on giving them another star until I see if their quality holds up across the rest of the menu.

After hearing positive comments about this place from a co-worker, we gathered the troops and headed over there yesterday to give them a test drive.\n\nThe Tempe location is essentially an old Village Inn restaurant that they appear to be converting into a deli. We arrived unannounced with a party of 8 and the staff was quick to push some tables together to accommodate our group.\n\nThe staff here is friendly and the service was good. Once we got settled, our server put some pickles out on the table to snack on while she took our drink orders.\n\nThe menu options here are limitless...we had a hard time making a choice. I finally settled on Dutchy's Pastrami Deluxe - which just about put me into a culinary coma. I have not had a sandwich this good in a long time. If you are a Miracle Mile/Carnegie Deli fan, then this place is for you. The size of the sandwiches are HUGE, so unless you walk in with a big appetite, I highly suggest you order a half-sandwich unless you plan on bringing part of your lunch home in a box. I had to laugh when I saw an option on the menu to double the meat for an additional $4.50 - I don't know who could possibly put down that amount of food (unless you were attempting to imitate an episode of Man vs. Food).\n\nThe pastrami was perfectly seasoned/cooked and the bread was very fresh. You get your choice of fries or potato salad as a side - both of which received kudos from our party.\n\nAfterwards, the manager stopped by to ensure everything was good and our server was kind enough to break our checks out individually (which she offered to do upfront without us asking).\n\nI will be honest - I'm somewhat picky when it comes to deli's. Jason's for me is okay, but nothing special. I can make a comparable sandwich at home, so there is nothing unique to draw me there. Gandolfo's NY Deli has also left me unimpressed.\n\nI would highly recommend Archie's to anyone for some excellent NY deli-style sandwiches...just bring a big appetite with you.

My father is notorious for ordering Reubens then saying \"It's not as good as Stan's,\" an old deli is Scottsdale.  \n\nI got the meat platter, which had corned beef, pastrami, and tounge, as well swiss, potato salad and cole slaw.  I knew it was going to be way too much food, but I figured I'd get a taste of everything.  \n\nI ordered some kugel, which we ate as an appetizer.  The server asked me if i wanted it cold or microwaved.  I would much prefer \"would you like it cold or warm.\"  I don't want to know you're just going to nuke it.  I'd prefer to think it came straight out of the oven.  I have to say, the kugel is outstanding.  \n\nThe meat was quite good, though a touch dry. Pastrami had good fat content and look good.  The corned beef had nice marbling and a good flavor.  The tounge, whch I don't normally eat, was also good.  The salads were workable as well.  Dad seemed to enjoy his reuben, and didn't make any negative comments, which means it was excellent.  \n\nOverall, the experience was good, but it was slow.

Because the sandwich I got the first time was so good, I figured hey, let's go to Archies and I'll get a half of a sandwich and you can tell me what you think.  \n\nIf you've been to Archies, you know the whole sandwiches are large and very tasty. You can read my first review for the details on that. However, if you're in the mood to save 3 or 4 bucks, or aren't entirely hungry for a giant sandwich, I suggest you head to paradise bakery or pretty much anywhere else if all you're looking for is a half. You'll see why below.\n\nThe menu selection for a half a sandwich and a side was considerably smaller than the regular sandwiches, and they come with fries or coleslaw etc... The prices range from $6-7.5, which isn't too bad.  \n\nHowever, this is where the bad comes in. We all ordered half sandwiches: ham, turkey, and pastrami. When we received the sandwiches we all had the OK...  :-\\ sad face look. The sandwich was nothing but some slices of meat in between two pieces of rye bread. They didn't come with any condiments at all, no cheese, no lettuce, no tomatoes or mayonnaise, nothing. Nor were we offered any condiments. I don't know if it's the fault of the waitress for not asking us what we wanted on our sandwiches (or our fault for assuming a sandwich would come with condiments), or if they just don't offer it, but that's something that's kind of important for a sandwich, otherwise it's not even a sandwich, it's bread and meat, like a giant size lunchable served with fries. Nor were we given the choice of bread type. I don't know if you've tried it, but Ham on Rye isn't exactly the best combo. Besides the apparent lack of variety, the bread seemed freshly baked, but was rather chewy and the crust was near inedible due to the sheer amount of force required to rip it. I felt like a little kid eating inside the crust lines of a pb and j sandwich (with more of a wince than the smile you get from the sweetness of jelly). \n\nSadly, I get the feeling that the half sandwich menu is designed to make you think you're getting a deal, however, it's designed to be the highest profit margin section of the sandwich menu with no expensive extras like cheese or vegetables on the sandwich. Until this place offers half of a \"true\" sandwich, I won't be coming back. The sad excuse for a sandwich was not a good first impression for my other co worker, and I doubt he'll stop by again any time soon. \n\nUnless you're catering to the senior crowd with no taste buds, your second half of your sandwich menu needs an overhaul.

I used to eat at this place when it was a village inn , so theres a bit of nostalgia. I'm not sure if they are considered a \"Jewish\" deli but they have all sort of yummy Jewish specialties like Kugel and Matzo ball soup. Anyway, I've had their \"Dutchy's\" Pastrami Deluxe sandwich and it was to die for. Home-made toasted rye bread, excellent russian dressing, some of the best cole-slaw I have ever had, and the hot pastrami was piled at least 4 inches high. The thing that made the sandwich standout so much was the fact that the pastrami was no fatty or chewy, but still melted in your mouth. The french fries were thick-cut and seasoned with kosher salt, pretty solid but the side of ranch dressing I got was sub-par. \n\nOn my next visit I had a cheese-steak hoagie. This thing was massive, and the steak was juicy and tender despite the meat being lean and not fatty. It was served on a nice sesame wheat bun. \n\nMy dad had their matzo ball soup which is homemade and light and tasty, unlike allot of places where the matzo ball is dense and boring. He also had half of a Reuben and it was just as generous as the full-size sandwich except cut in half. Their corned-beef is excellent and not fatty or greasy like their other meats.   \n\nOn both visits the service was prompt and friendly and our drinks were kept refilled constantly. On the first visit our really new waiter made a couple goofs but fixed his errors quickly enough. \n\nThe thing I like the most about this place is that it beats the crap out of Chompie's (another popular \"Jewish\" deli/diner), in my opinion. I've been going to Chompie's for many, many years and we have almost always had bad, painstakingly slow service and borderline rude wait-staff. You would think they would fix it but our complaints have always fallen on deaf-ears.  I can walk into Archie's and get immediately waited on, then have yummy food in under 15 minutes. \n\nThey also have tons of home-made and imported baked goodies. I can attest that they brownie was pretty awesome.

I looked at the menu before going and the vegetarian sandwiches sounded pretty good. And there was more than one, so I figured why not try it out. I would have been better off skipping this one.\n\nSo my husband and I went in about 6pm and we were the only people in there, which always makes me uncomfortable.

I have been to some places before where its been pretty dead, and the service is slower than it should be. So the girl comes out with a plate of pickles and takes our drink order. My husband tasted the pickles first and told me they were super salty. So I tasted them, and they tasted like they were dipped in salt. There were also a couple wedges of what looked like tomato? But I was too afraid to try them to be sure. Then she comes back and takes our order. I got a vegetarian hash with some rye toast. I thought all sandwiches came with a side, but mine didn't. Which is fine, I wasn't that hungry anyway. My husband got a mozzarella, tomato, and italian bread sandwich with a side of fries. My hash was not what I thought it would be. When you think of a hash, you think crispy potatoes, full of veggies, and just really tasty. Mine was none of those things. It was mushy potatoes, and little tiny bits of vegetables.

I expected a little more the first time I ate and the same after this past experience.  \n\nBasically, my major reservations about the Vig are:\n\n1. No waiters - From an employment standpoint I feel this to be a way to tighten up the cost of labor.  If you want a counter order deli, put in a Capriottis.\n\n2. There is no comparison between the Vig & Carnegie in Mirage.  The food, service, and portions are all justified in the price.  This brings on #3\n\n3.  For the price, the M resort can do so much better; and does.  Almost every restaurant in the M, including the The Red Cafe is a better overall choice IMHO.  \n\nFinally, I would like to summarize my review by saying that although, the Vig is a small blemish to the M resort on most key points.

Forget the upscale breakfast and faux southwest shops that dot and line Scottsdale. Forget the 'burbs of Peoria, Goodyear, and East Mesa. Don't let your visiting family leave without making a trip down to the Phoenix Ranch Market on 16th st and Roosevelt. Yes, this is south of the I-10 freeway and far away from your faux mexican food at Macayo's Cantina. At Phoenix Ranch Market you'll find a side of the city that nearly all of the transplanted surburban population seems to want to ignore, or just completely forget. This is Phoenix being Phoenix, not Phoenix trying to be a new Los Angeles or anyplace else.\n\nAfter having breakfast at a carbon copy brunch eggery, I was in need of something less perfect and faux. I found exactly what I was craving. When you can hear the sounds of mariachi or radio campesina from your car parked at the other end of a packed lot, you know this isn't the local Kroger you're about to enter.\n\nPart grocery store, part food court, part village market, PRM is huge, it's overwhelming and it's surprisingly clean and comfortable - this isn't a low rent grocery like Food City. With a fresh seafood section two or three times the size you'd find anywhere else in Phoenix, and with parts of animals you've probably never prepared at home, it's fun to just look, but even more fun to buy. Want meat? Want better options? Better cuts? Want an entire skinned cow's head with the eyes intact and staring at you? Check. It's all SO GOOD.\n\nBut that's just the meats. They make their own tortillas onsite with a literal factory and small army of workers churning out the flat corn and flour awesomeness. Hungry? Want mexican food? Want great mexican food? ALWAYS consider going here. Think of anything on a restaurant menu and you have it here. Prepared fresh, and a la carte. Seriously. Tamales of any kind. Horchata! Cow Tongue! Burritos of immense size and stuffed with anything you want. Some of the best beans in town, rice, and parts from a pig that still actually look like parts from a pig. This isn't the mall food court.\n\nThe place is packed with mostly hispanic families but you'll also notice a few adventurous types, including my asian self. Most of the employees speak english very well so language is not a barrier. The only times you'll need help is when asking what is that? And like mentioned above, the answer just might be cow tongue (which by the way, is good, however I can see how the texture would turn some people off. Imagine a soft almost too mushy beef...)\n\nOh. The food is also cheap. You'll get more than full off of $5, you'll explode at $10. It's seriously like heaven here. Music, people, atmosphere, food, drinks, desserts, baked goods. All of it awesome. I met up with my friend Amy.The.Kidd for 'lunch' and we ended up spending almost 4 hours just walking around, back and forth, trying each new item we found, or trying the standards but knowing they were going to be better here. Mmmm. Horchata, great corn tamales, rice, beans, empanadas, warm fresh tortillas... bring everyone. This is a place that should be in people's minds when they think of Phoenix, not just the golf courses, or upscale Scottsdale, or Frat/Sorority Tempe... but South Phoenix.

The boy decided to use it for a school project so I tagged along to see if I could help. The second we walked in the door however, all hope in my helping him was lost. My mind was in a frenzy as I decided where to stop first. The Jugeria for some Horchata? Or the restaurant for some asada?

Its a noble effort to bring Mexican staples and unconventionals to the big city in the middle of Arizona, USA, but the product are tinged with americanization; from their weekend menudo, which is wholly rubbish, to the carne which is a grade above what you would get in a true Mexican market (damn FDA).  Though the latter may sound like an unusual gripe, its that stringy gato-grade-meat that makes fajitas and tortas uniquely tasty.

As of June 1, 2009 travelers must possess either a passport, passport card, or WHTI-compliant identification to enter the US by air, land or sea. Contrary to popular belief however, Americans will be able to visit the Phoenix Ranch Market without documentation.\n\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION/DESCRIPCION GENERAL: Phoenix Ranch Market III is an upmarket Mexican-style mercado complete with an interior food court called \"La Cocina\" (The Kitchen). It is located in a rather unpleasant part of town, but manages to attract a large following of gringos eager to inject some diversity into their palette without risking turista.\n\nTHE FOOD/LA ALIMENTACIN: Offerings in \"La Cocina\" run the gamut from Mexican style tortas, to more iconic tacos and burritos. Many items offer a choice of meat, from ham to carne asada, to carnitas. A separate area offers various seafood dishes. Everything is ala carte, suprising those hoping to economize using an American style \"combo\".  Despite this, \"La Cocina\" remains popular, especially at lunch time.\n\nSERVICE/SERVICIO: All orders are taken by an attendant standing next to the line for the cashier. Most guests do not wait long before placing the order. Some have reported difficulty communicating with the attendant however, the other employees tend to have command of the English language. Visitors are responsible for retrieving their own orders and seating themselves at long bench-style tables. \n\nPRICES/PRCIOS: Like Mexico itself, the Ranch Market is not the bargain it is made out to be. Prices that may look low for entrees quickly increase when adding in the cost of beverages, churros, and gas. Most respondents however, believe that the mercado occupies an important niche between true fast food and more sophisticated self-serve meals. \n\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS/CONSIDERACIONES ESPECIAL: Some have accused the Phoenix Ranch Market from being too acommodating to non-Latino customers. While this concern cannot be dismissed, it is obviously the case that all of Mexico has fallen to this trend. New hotels now gleam along the shoreline in Puerto Penasco, golf courses spourt in the arid desert outside Cabo San Lucas, all while Costcos can be found in such tourist-heavy states as Veracruz and Guanajuato.

I knew that the market had a lot going on at all times; I nearly run down at least 6 people getting in and out of the parking lot and I'm a really good driver (seriously-not Raymond from Rain Man good, but actually good!). The parking lot on the store side is always packed.\n\nSo the focus of my trip was the cucina. It was bustling for lunch already at just 10:30. So as I'm trying to make sense of the menus posted in both Spanish and English on the wall above the hot food line or whatever, I am greeted by a nice woman that helps me decide where to go. She mentioned sopes first, so that's what I started with.\n\nMy order was way too much food for one, but I wanted to try a couple of things. So I got both a chicken and a steak sopa, a street taco al pastor (pork), and a side of beans. They did have combos unlike another reviewer said but I only wanted to add beans an opted for a side instead. My total for food was $11.00. Not super cheap, but like I said more food than I would normally order at once.  \n\nSo a sope for those unfamilar is not a torta as someone else said. It's more like a weird tostada or open faced sandwich. The base is somewhere between a corn tortilla and an all out bread. It does appear to be flash fried to cook but I'm not totally sure and it didn't feel greasy. The sides are curved to make a small cup to fill with beans, meat of choice, topped with shredded lettuce, grated cojita cheese (I'd describe Mexican parm--hard salty and good!!) The chicken and steak were both tasty. The steak was a little strung together if you will. I'd rather have seen it be chopped better so I would be easier to eat smaller bites. If your teeth didn't make it through that bite, a big chunk was coming along with it. Sorta messy but good though I felt like my sopa was a bit tougher than it should be and my extra cheap plastic fork would bend to the will of the sope.\n\nThe street taco was just so I could taste the al pastor. Two tiny corn tortillas topped with a bit of pork. I topped it with onions and cilantro and would totally eat the al pastor in another dish. \n\nBeans. Not a really a fan. They lacked the taste of say Carolina's beans though the texture matched. A disappointment. \n\nSalsa bar was good. Hot green and red, and the pico was spicy too. Fresh onions and chopped cilantro are a must so it was good to have those. \n\nAgua Fresca...Just love it. I had the fresh guava juice. So tasty and well worth the additional $2.91 I spent for the 32oz drink. \n\nTotal food and drink, $13.91. A little spendy for lunch served in stryo while seated on a bench, but it was fun and I will order a little differently next time so it won't be as expensive and I won't order more food than I can eat.\n\nMarket, looks good. Great looking bakery (really), meat counter, tortilla factory, etc. I'll probably not go out of my way to get there for things I can buy at Food City on a regular day. This does look like a fun way to go get some lunch before you shop for dinner on a weekend. I'll definitely take others for hot food and a fun people watching experience, plus pick up a few goods on the way. \n\nI don't really know about authentic. It's probably not. I don't really care.

Certainly one of our famous triple digit days, and as I sat in the passenger seat, bumming a ride from mi amigo, Vicente, I couldnt shake my contempt for his leather seats.\n We drove down Roosevelt in the Garfield district towards Ranch Market, on the way discussing the Alwun house, Rito's, and some colourful housing that we both agreed leant to the overall gentrification of the neighborhood.\n The grounds of this place are sprawling, palatial in fact. I was completely ripped and had on a pair of imitation wayfarers that had a broken arm and kept sliding off my face with the least possible movement of my head. \n Endeavoring not to break them further I held my head at rigid attention my back was grammar school like in posture. I then realized how arrogant and white I must've looked, in my mind I fantasized I was a conquistador with a local Toltec guide showing me the ins and outs of the Aztec village we were entering, then I kinda got sick of that phantasy and pictured myself as a balmy Harrison Ford intrepidly following Albert Molina through an alternate ruinous Mayan temple, all the while expecting danger and betrayal at every corner.\n I probably looked half insane as some of the patrons looked at me oddly, giving me a wide birth. Entering the place it's just as big inside. It's like costco and food city had a wild passionate tequila filled tryst and gave birth to the Eva Longoria of grocery stores.\n Vicente and I immediately split up, probably not the best of ideas, but I wanted to explore and he was eager to do the same. I quickly snatched up the worst shopping cart in the store (you know the one with a bad front wheel and sticky grip) and let my stomach guide me.\n Two gallons of horchata. check. Exotic mozzarella style cheese from Oaxaca and  some delicious salty Cotija. check. A lb. of plantains. check. Mango's, apples, dried pinto beans, sugar snap peas, string beans, potato's, roma tomato's- check! \n Grocery shopping while intoxicated can get a little quixotic, and confusing to say the least. I hadnt the slightest clue what I was going to make, but the colors of the produce were certainly alluring.\n Finally Vicente caught up with me and laughed gutturally upon seeing my hodge podge of a shopping cart. I stared thru him with glazed eyes as I espied the \"cafeteria\". I abandoned my shopping cart and slowly walked over, intriguiged, literally beguiled by the aroma of cooked meats. \n I hadnt the slightest clue what most of it was, and what broken Spanish I know certainly wasnt helping with most of the dishes behind the glass, until bingo; Carnitas.\n There was a word I knew and loved, I stared at the \"meat\" not quite convinced I knew what I was looking at. Sure it said carnitas, but this was...well...it resembled a tamarind bean, but was much longer, and had a color ruddy and blackish, certainly most unappealing. The tube like meat sat coiled amongst itself like tentacles in a brackish water. I stared at it hypnotized, until a young Mexican attendant came to take my order. \n \"Hey man what you want?\" he asked, breaking the glamour that held me entranced.\n \"...a half a pound of this...\" I said unsteadily. He looked at me almost impressed, and half cautiously. As he deflty grasped a pair of tongs and started sloshing the meat back and forth in it's brackish juices, attempting a better grip, it looked more alien to me than ever. I was beginning to come to my senses out of a stupor, and it was slowly dawning on me what this was.\n In a slightly horrified and hoarse whisper I leaned over the counter and looked him in the eyes and asked, \"Wait, wait......what is this...stuff!?\"\n Then he said, grinning a knowing, mocking grin, \"Yoo don' know whad tis is and yoo wanna poun' of eet man?\" \n Just then Vicente strolled up casually behind me and saw what I was doing, the two exchanged a brief chuckle as apparently Vin had overheard the attendant's query.\n \"Trrrriiipa!\" Vicente exclaimed, using his dormant mexican accent that usually only comes out when drunk or speaking with his parents, to which the attendant grinned and nodded enthusiatically.\n Aghast, I stepped back in revulsion, I'd nearly ordered a pound of pigs intestines.I felt profoundly embarassed, never more had I shown off the \"pinche gringo\" side of my personality than in that moment. \n I ended up just ordering some pork ribs that'd been marinated in a chile sauce, along with the ubiquitous spanish rice and refried beans.\n I love ranch market, but I'm certainly not going back until the raspberry of embarassment lightens.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 20, "useful": 13, "cool": 13}}, {"text": "I went over here to try the breakfast burrito's, but it appears that they don't make you a fresh burrito every time you order.
