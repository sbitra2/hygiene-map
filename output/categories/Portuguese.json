If I want to eat out at Fountain Park, I will automatically first think of Nando's.  Trouble is, quite often everyone else has the same idea.  This won't stop me coming back here though.\n\nI'd never even heard of Nando's before I came to Edinburgh.  I had no idea of what I was missing, and it was only when I moved into Bruntsfield a couple of years back that I realised the error of my ways.  The idea of Nando's is simple.  You can get chicken done to differing levels of spicyness,  These can then be had with a variety of side dishes, or as a burger, wrap, pitta, or other things.  There are, of course, provisions made for any vegetarians who may come along.\n\nThe kitchen at Nando's feels much like a part of the restaurant.  You can see the grills at work as you order your food, and watch the magic unfold.  Nando's feels a bit like a fast food place, in that you place your order at the counter, and collect your own cutlery and sauces.  On the sauces front, try the extra extra hot sauce (in the black bottle).  The consensus amongst my friends is that it is not the hottest one they offer.  What do you think?\n\nI have never been disappointed with the food I have got from Nando's.  It is often busy and so, the food can sometimes take a while to arrive, but you'll forget about that once you start eating.\n\nIf you have never eaten at Nando's, I have no idea why.  You are missing one of Edinburgh's great culinary experiences.!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "It is a testament to Nando's that despite this being one of the bigger restaurants it has, that there always seems to be long queues to get a table. As Mark says, this is the first option people opt for when they go to Fountain Park, and there is a very good reason for this, because the food is so tasty!\nI can be a bit of a pig when I go here, my usual choice I go for is the 1/2 chicken, bathed in several layers of chicken peri perisauce, with this I usually order a side of chips and a corn on the cob. You can get garlic bread as a side, but I would suggest against this, you only get a couple of slices, and it really doesn't provide you with good value for money. This meal comes to around \u00a39, but considering a meal at Burger King costs around \u00a36, the few extra quid, really is worth it and puts them a cut above such fast food joints.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Mmmmm Nandos, now this is really finger licking good chicken!!! If you haven't been to Nandos before and like spicy food this place is defo worth a try.

The chicken was not dry as it an be elsewhere but peri peri perfection!\n\nIt is a large Nandos and being so close to the cinema gets really heaving at peak times. I knocked one star off for the length of time taken to place our order, 15mins standing in the queue is tiring on my legs! Although it was a busy night but from what the waitress said it is always busy even during the week, but opening an extra till seems an easy fix and as one was unmanned I think they could have done this.\n\nAll in all a very enjoyable experience oh and final thing for a big Nandos the toilets were immaculate, have to give credit here as don't know about you but I think the state of an establishmens toilets tells you how much on the ball they are!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "My favourite hot chicken restaurant!

Other food stuff are served but in less variety.\nMy favoutite is the chicken wings - they are better than any bufallo had before.

There, I said it. Nandos seems to be like Marmite - people either love it or hate it. For me, it's love. It's spicy. It's freshly-grilled chicken. A WHOLE chicken if you want. I normally pip for the half. And they have ratatouille and sweet potato mash. It's a filling, hearty but also relatively healthy feed.\n\nIt's hard to review different Nando branches, as it's a chain and one of the thing a chain should do well is reproduce the same quality everywhere. They do. The chicken here is so less juicy, hot, fresh and flavourful. I suppose as this branch is attached to the cinema and bowling complex, it gets really busy. But the staff are really efficient, always smiling and never seem stressed waiting on the crowds.\n\nI ordered take out from here recently and whilst waiting, I sat and watched the behind-the-till and kitchen staff. It ticked over like a well oiled machine, or well spiced chicken (No, wait that doesn't work. Nevermind). They had a system, they were rocking it. I was impressed. I left with my half a chicken in a bag and I hadnt been happier that day.\n\nI suppose I'm giving this one 3 stars as I only come here if I'm going to the cinema, and even then it's only every few visits that I go, due to how busy it gets.

The food was all piping hot when it got to the table.  The chorizos were flamb\u00e9d right at the table!! (And all who tried it said it was delicious and not greasy) two of our friends had a steak and cheese sandwhich with a spicy gravy and a fried egg on top - that looked amazing... two had the pork and beef skewers and commented that the spice rub was just right, flavorful with heat, but not overpowering.  My sister in law had steak with potatoes and an egg, she was impressed at how perfectly the steak was done to her order (medium rare)... \n\nWe didn't even wait for our mains to make our verdict - after the appetisers (the afore mentioned rissois, along with cod cakes and 2 chorizos) we had decided we were definitely coming back.  \n\nThe wait staff were helpful and attentive, I had trouble deciding between the two bacalhau dishes and with a single question \"do you like salty food\" our waitress helped me decide.
