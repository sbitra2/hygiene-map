So I changed my order to friend shrimp.\nIt took awhile to get the food out, which is okay because it was homemade. But we only got our glasses filled up once while we were there and we had to flag the guy down to do it. And they wern't busy so I was really confused as to why our service wasn't better.

Bad thing is they don't give you unlimited, only one per person. \n\nThe food finally came, and I think all around everyone was pretty pleased. My shrimp  was huge and done in cornmeal, I've never had it that way before but it was delicious all the same. They didn't have any coctail sauce which kinda stunned me but whatev, Their tartar sauce was good and I don't normally like it so eh.

Ordered food at counter and was asked if it was \"for here or to go?\". Wife and I both ordered catfish but wife had greens and yams for sides and I had fries and slaw. We joked about who was from the farthest south by the sides. New location has 7 tables and seats 22 people. It is as one reviewer stated like an old factory break room. There was one table occupied with a couple and a teenage boy beside us. When food came both orders were identical including the sides. I pointed out I ordered different sides and waiter said \"no you both ordered the same\". I pointed out he agreed that my wife had ordered a more southern side and then he admitted that I had ordered slaw and fries. He asked if we needed anything else and I asked for some tartar sauce and ketchup for my fries. The fries arrived about half way through my meal and he put an empty ketchup container on the table. I called him back and asked for one with ketchup in it and he brought me a dish full instead (only have 1 container)?

The food: Greens and yams were very good. cornbread average, catfish OK. It went from very thin to very thick which means some of it is either overcooked or undercooked. The other table had chitterlings and they seemed to enjoy them and ate it all. For chicken I have had better at Popeyes (I have also tried Paula Deen's and said the same thing). Kathy may be a great cook but has no concept of how to run a restaurant. Good home cooking but bad service and \"I don't give a damn\" attitude would not keep her in business in the south.

My son and his dad had the fried catfish and they rated it better than Hush Puppy's--the gold standard according to them.  I don't eat fish, but just looking at their food, I could tell it wasn't as greasy as the catfish I've seen at other places.  \n Service was great, the food is delicious, and the only reason I am not giving it a 5 star rating is that I'm a stickler for good mac n cheese, and theirs was just okay.

The food was pre-made and reheated in a microwave, but it was still good. Still, it's always disappointing to have your plate of soulfood goodness put down in front of you and your mac and cheese is still holding the same shape as the container it was stored in.\n\nI'm giving them four stars because of the ambiance and their stellar service.

He offered a discount if we gave a great Yelp review, so think of that when you look at other reviews.\n\nOne dining partner ordered the veggie plate, which is basically cornbread and your choice of three sides.

I was excited!\n\nIt pretty much ended there. I really, really, really wanted to like this place. I would have preferred to have loved this place, but I would have settled for an \"I love you, but not in THAT way\" sort of conversation here. \n\nAlas, I am not sure I want a second date.\n\nFirst: The service was VERY slow. Yes, it's a small place. And mostly it was service with a smile. But it was slow. We all but flagged the waiter down to order our drinks. And then again to order lunch. He kept pointing out how slammed they were. I could see it, I sort of get it, but then there should be more help on the floor. He was genuinely kind and happy to help us, but it doesn't make up for the fact that once both of us were seated, it took 15 minutes-plus to finally let them know what we wanted to eat. Add to that the wait for the food itself? My hour lunch was approaching an hour and I hadn't had anything to eat yet.\n\nNever got a drink refill. Had to ask for silverware. Getting the to-go boxes (I took those greens to go!) and the checks was OK, but then had to wait for the payments to be processed while watching the waiter do other things.\n\nOK, OK, there were SOME good points.\n\nHere we go... food. I decided to try the liver and onions. You get to choose three (huge portions here!) sides. I went with mac and cheese, collard greens, and fried cabbage. (Oy, I did not come here expecting to adhere to any diet, that's for sure!)\n\nThe large portion of liver was cooked perfectly but the cut was off. Too much connective tissue running through it. I'd rather smaller pieces cut away from the parts you can't chew/eat. It had a hint of a breading/coating on it that was not bad, not over the top. But I had a small bit where it was all flour. No bueno.\n\nThe collard greens were the best ever. Seriously. Eat them. (Insert \"Eat All The Greens! meme here.)\n\nThe mac was good, definitely homemade. I only tasted it because pasta is not my friend, but the flavors and composition were really decent. Not amazing, but decent.\n\nThe cabbage was, against all odds, really great. Too oily/buttery for MY tastes, but still managing not to be wilted and brown; it was bright, a tad crisp. Surprisingly good but slightly over on the grease scale for MY tastes (trying to be fair... it is, after all, \"fried cabbage!\").\n\nS's massive portion of meatloaf with rice with gravy were good, she said, though the yams were a tad on the raw side. She also had the mac and agreed: good, yes, tasty, but nothing to write home about. (To go box for the food here, too, so that says a little something.)\n\nAnother thing I didn't love? The photos on the menu didn't seem to totally match the food. Not just like, \"hey, mine doesn't look like that,\" but in a \"they don't even offer that on their menu!\" sort of way. I felt cheated that I couldn't order cole slaw or green beans, even though they were so prominently displayed.\n\nHuge portions of mostly OK-ish food. Smiley but slooooow service.

Perfectly crisp and flavorful.\n\nAmong the sides I tried, the cabbage and yams were good, while the mac and cheese and collared green were just alright.\n\nThe cornbread was very moist with good texture as well.\n\nIf there were a 0.5 star rating, I would probably give EllaEm's a 3.5 overall.

It is crispy on the outside, the breading or whatever they use is not to thick or overpowering, it's perfectly seasoned and crunchy, but wait, when you get to the fish.....OH MY! It is like butter; it melts in your mouth and is so delicious you would never even think it is fish. Definitely the best WE have ever had (yes I had to share, the meal was large)\nI am not from the south, but have visited NC and eaten catfish at many other places before and this is by far the best I have ever had.

We sat ourselves down and no one acknowledged us. There were only 3 other guests sitting at tables so it wasnt busy at all. So we sat, and sat, until i got a little anxious and finally one waitress walks over past my table didnt look at me and go to my friends table and pass her one menu...I was thinking didnt that silly girl see all of us walk in and why would she only give her one menu then turn around and walk away. I wondered were me and my kids invisible?? Well finally another waitress came over Heather to take my order and all. Tonight my review of the place is mostly of the service because that determines whether i want to spend my time and money at a place where the employees are so very rude.\nMy friends and i had sat at two different tables next to each other since it was 8 of us. Their waitress (the rude one) had taken their drink request and all before mine did, however my waitress brought out my drinks and cornbread before theirs did and when she did i watched as she kinda slammed it on the table WTH?\nAnother couple came into the door an ederly couple and she was right on them as soon as they hit the door with their menus and giving them their drinks and they had not been in the door 5 full minutes.

I guess that happens sometimes.  The mac and cheese was pretty good.  The greens were tender and full of flavor.  Soul food has a ton of salt in it, just in my opinion the salt could be toned down.  Of course, I wouldn't mess with a family recipe that has been passed down through the generations just because some Asian guy said something on Yelp.\n\nWhile I was eating the chicken I looked at my fingers and they didn't have any grease on them.

Both were delicious, but I prefer the beef gravy. I would probably skip this next time and order another side in the future.\nCollard greens - Not a big fan of collard greens in general but hubby said it was good (But he had better when he was in Mississippi).\nFried cabbage - DELICIOUS! Sooo homey and definitely a big hit for both of us and we licked that bowl off for sure! We should have ordered more of these. \nFried chicken (2 pcs) - Juicy and crispy! I love fried chicken cooked this way, lightly battered and seasoned with Granny's special seasoning. \nMashed potatoes - Tastes like how we make it at home. Between my husband and I we could have skipped it but my daughter will probably not like that cause it's her staple.\nYams - Soooo good.

You get 3 nice sized chicken wings, a waffle, and eggs any style you want. The chicken was crispy and slight breading to it. The waffle was just ok.

Came with your choice of 3 sides. I picked Mashed Potatoes with Beef Gravy, Mac n Cheese, and Mixed Veggies. This is where I got really disappointed. The Catfish was decent but all the sides tasted a bit bland and was lukewarm. The veggies were definitely not fresh because it was partially soggy, it looked lifeless, and was chewy when I took a bite. The Mac n Cheese tasted like what I make my kids at home with the instant microwave stuff. It's not fancy but it is good enough for them. Here at a restaurant that is unacceptable.

I use the term southern, whereas EllaEm's and many of the cafes of this type in town use Soul Food. I believe they are synonymous as both southern and soul food share almost all aspects. They most unifying similarity is they are both born out of poverty, and this is what makes southern/soul food an art. It is easy to make a fantastic meal when you have the finest cuts of meat and important spices with which to flavor the food. However, when you have to create magic from the poorest cuts of meat, vegetables that are easy to grow and considered common, and your spice palate consist of little more than salt, pepper and broth that is the example of a true artist. It is easy to paint when you have all the paints and a fine canvas, but to create something out of nothing with almost nothing shows real talent. \n\nEllaEm's is artistry on display. It is fine southern food with flavor to spare. This is not a diet conscious restaurant where calories can be counted. It is instead a representation of a culture where food is used as an offering of love, and often the best of times happen around a dinner table. There is little pomp, and no circumstances here, just good food at a reasonable price...well mostly reasonable. \n\nOn my first visit I had the fried chicken (dark meat), fried cabbage, red beans and rice, mashed potatoes and gravy, and two corn muffins (my heart will never forgive me). The chicken was excellent, very moist and fresh with a good crispy crust. My one of only two complaints from the evening was there were only two pieces of dark meat chicken. The sides made it more than enough for a fulfilling meal, but one more piece of chicken would have made me feel better about the order. The red beans and rice were good, but not great. The mashed potatoes with chicken gravy were to die for. I must return to have the chicken and waffles with chicken gravy (for which my heart will once again curse me). I had the fried cabbage at the suggestion of my friendly and courteous, albeit somewhat slow, server (second small complaint) . The cabbage was perhaps the best part of the meal, and would win hands down if not for the corn muffin. Go ahead and order two at the start because one is just not going to cut it. \n\nI would like to give EllaEm's 4.5 stars because of the two small discrepancies I mentioned above. I rounded up instead of down because ElleEm's is exactly the type of business I, and I hope you, like to support. It is local owned, not in a fancy location, and providing a good service at a reasonable price. I big you if you are wanting a good meal with a distinct American cultural edge, chose ElleEm's over any one of the worthless and \"soulless\" chain restaurants which litter our city.

The chicken needs more seasoning and there needs to be a few more pieces on the plate. The waffle needs to be pumped up some because they are a bit on the thin side and not too flavorful.

It comes with any 3 sides of your choice. I originally chose the Mac & cheese, potato salad, and mashed potatoes with beef gravy, but our waitress said they were out of potato salad at the moment so I settled for the candied yams instead. My boyfriend ordered the Wingettes & Waffles, which is just chicken wings and a waffle. \n\nThe fried catfish was cooked great. It wasn't too oily at all. The Mac and cheese tasted no different from any other Mac and cheese but the mashed potatoes and candied yams were probably the best I ever had, and I don't even like yams lol. The portions of both the catfish and the sides were huge. So big that there was no way I could've finished it all no matter how hard I was trying. My boyfriend's chicken and waffles were also delicious. The waffle was kinda thin but it was still really flavorful to me. I didn't try the fried chicken wings by itself but the way they cook their chicken and their homemade waffle recipe made for a perfect combination. \n\nAbout 15 minutes after we started eating, our waitress came back to our table with a side of potato salad for me, on the house, because she felt bad that they didn't have any when she took my order.

I am wholeheartedly disagreeing with that.

The chicken fried steak was really bland and tough, but the crust was nice and crispy. The gravy was a bland chicken gravy, not the typical white gravy with pepper. My chicken was pretty good, but when I told my server at LoLo's a few months ago that I liked their chicken better than Mrs. White's, I thought she might fall over with incredulity- and sheer joy.

She is on the phone with her boyfriend calling him out for cheating on her. Using all sorts of profanity while doing so. \n\n3. I state that I am there for the to go order and that is it. No one says it will be a few more mins or anything. Now mind you I live on 10th St & Camelback so travel time to Mrs. Whites should have been sufficient time to prepare...fried fish, mac and cheese and mixed greens. 2 of the 3 dishes are cooked already I am sure. \n\n4. I wait for about 10 mins when a older gentleman that works there reminds the phone lady that I am waiting for my order. I assume she is the cook. Well phone lady never even started my order. She did not start my order until 10 mins after I walked in the door and she was done calling out her boyfriend on the phone.\n\n5. In my 30 mins of sitting and waiting.

In these days of flash frozen prepared dishes that are uniform from visit to visit at chain restaurants, this food is made in a tiny hot kitchen.

My grandmother's cabbage has spoiled me; it's hard to satisfy me with this dish.\nThe rice and gravy was a bit disappointing.  It was bland gravy over white rice.

Only complaint was that some of the bananas were too ripe, although some people like it that way?\nThat's all for my meal. \n I didn't even look at the receipt, hmmm...no clue how much it all cost me haha.  I didn't care.  I've been hearing about this place since I moved to AZ and actually swerved from the far right lane on Jefferson into the parking lot, taking out several vehicles in doing so (j/k).  \nThe place itself as others have said is pretty dumpy.  The best food is found in places of this status but as I was looking around I felt myself wishing that this specific place would get a face lift.  I don't know, its just that they are such a staple and well-known place...they could at least frame some of the memorabilia they have on the wall.  Not dirty though, mind you.  The girl there was diligently mopping.  Too much clutter by the register...personal items of the staff just laying around.  C'mon now.  Represent what you serve, instead of allowing people to think that what they will get served may represent the look of the place.  A rinky dink liquor store that serves the best corned beef - they can look like a disaster, that's just fine.  But these guys are a soul food force in the area and I feel they could be even more with an update to their building.\nThe folks that were working there were just fine to me.  An older man greeted the customers, gave instruction to the servers, and took my order.  He knew the regulars and greeted them enthusiastically.  I liked that.  Furthermore, some guy came in needing change.  The man (hmmm I guess that's probably Mr White???) gave him tips on where to park for cheap, gave him the money to park somewhere, and told him to hurry so he won't be late for his appointment.  :) :) :)  Also shared a few observations about a woman on tv (Let's Make A Deal).  \nNo one was rude.  You read what the golden rule is and you'll see its enforced here.  Do unto others...\nI saw a plate come out to a dine-in customer that was piled, and I mean PILED with fried chicken smothered in gravy and with greens and something else on the side.  It looked ridiculously amazing. \nI will go back.  I will try the porkchops, smothered this and that, and of course the catfish.  I'll also try some other sides, maybe the two I chose were their ho-hums anyway.\nI recommend trying their chicken at least once!\nOh and i saw someone on here mention their to-go order was skimpy...sorry bud but mines was 3 huge pieces that didn't even allow the box to close:)", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 4, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "All I can say is \"What the hell\"? I'm so embarrassed by some of the reviews that point out this is the best soul food they ever tasted.   They only could justify that untruth if they did not grow to in a family that cooked with love or never been to  a Kentucky Fried Chicken.  The food and service was horrible.  My guest and I had to ask for silverware, cornbread and refilled....again \"what the hell\".   I was raised on soul food and know the difference between store bought and homemade.  Oh sure they doctor it up but totally got the prescription wrong.  The food has absolutely no flavor, lacks salt, lowreys seasoning, black pepper, garlic powder, mind you these are staples in cooking soul food especially Fried Chicken.  I'm African American so this next statement is not intended to be racist but come on black people, how can you tout yourself as the best Fried Chicken and truly taste horrible.  Again, \"what the hell\".   It's very easy to make gravy....especially if you have the drippings from your fried chicken so why did this gravy taste like it came from a can.  What surprised me most was to see the tourist eat their food like it was the best food they ever tasted.  Poor visitors, this is not soul food.  Save your 17.00 per plate and drink  and go have Kentucky or better yet Jack in the box.  Yes almost $34 for two plates of chicken and two drinks.

After hearing a few people talk about how good the food is there , we wanted to give it a try.  We viewed their website and if you look under Entrees, you will see the meals are all priced at $10.18 per plate.  Good deal! \n\nWe arrive at the place and our first impressions are, the place needs cleaning and a paint job.  Most anyone can look past how a place looks if the service is great and the food is really good.  Most dive places I've been to have both... so the decor isn't something I get hung up on. \n\nService...  marginal at best.  Some guy... guessing the owner... arguing with the staff, singing... just doing whatever.  I guess this is acceptable since he owns/runs the place?  Not the best thing to do in front of customers. (again... it's a dive... not expecting 5 star services)\n\nServer---  stops my wife in front of the bathroom door to ask if she knows what she wants to order.  Maybe wait until we are all seated and ready to order?  Thought this was pretty strange! \n\nNow the food comes out.  Chicken wasn't horrible, wasn't great.  The canned mac-n-cheese... right up there with the best High School cafeteria mac-n-cheese.... not good!  Right from a box or can... no flavor... not homemade.   Very disappointing to say the least.  The greens... again... from a can... maybe some additional seasoning added... but.. odds are... if they were too lazy to make real mac-n-cheese... then they were too lazy to make real greens.  Gravy on the chicken... same sad story... from a box/can.... just not good or great. \n\nDessert--- sweet potato pie   not bad... probably one of the better things ordered.  What was crazy... if you can imaging this... take a normal/decent size slice of pie... now cut that in half and this was the serving size we got.  All for $4.99 a slice. NUTS!  $10 for two slivers of pie. A joke! \n\nRemember I mentioned the FALSE ADVERTISING at the beginning of this review.  All meals $10.18.  NOT TRUE!  The site hasn't been updated in who knows how long? \n\nYou sit down and the menu does not show the pricing... only mention of pricing is the Ox tales for $15.00.  So... you would assume from the website the meals are $10.18 each.  WRONG....  for  two meals, two very sad/small slices of pie.... $41.00 \n\nNo breakdown of the pricing ... the owner/manager just punched up some numbers on the calculator and that was the bill. \n\nAll in all... this place needs new management... some passion put back in to  the kitchen... and they need to update/clean the place.  Not to mention... in this day and age... no excuses to not having an updated website.... to properly reflect your business and pricing.  I have a feeling when Mrs White was running this place... it was awesome... not anymore. \n\nBad experience.. not even close to being worth the money spent.

I've been coming here for about seven or eight years and I remember when the food used to cost $8.80 per plate - AND after your meal someone was always walking around offering the dessert of the day to everyone. Quaint and tasty and decently priced. Now, everything is almost double that, over $14 per plate. And the flavours have gone downhill. I told these guys the cornbread at Mrs White's was all-world. Out comes stale shitty cornbread that I guarantee was made the previous day - we got there at just after 11am so I KNOW it wasn't fresh. One of my friends asked for mac and cheese, they didn't have it. Also didn't have red beans and rice, which is what I normally order. Um, ok. I asked for smothered chicken. The other two asked for fried chicken. Out come three plates of fried chicken. I was too hungry to care. Then the guy comes out and says they DO have mac and cheese. Whatever. Collard greens aren't flavourful at all - almost like something steamed out of a Green Giant freezer pack. Fried chicken was okay, but not anything better than Church's and three times the price. And nobody offered any dessert, not that we would have had it anyway.\n\nThe bill for all three of us came to $48!! For basically something I could have cobbled together myself and I'm not even kidding. Kraft mac and cheese would have been tastier. Fried chicken takes a little while but isn't rocket science. Collard greens are a twenty-five cent side, and I almost broke my tooth on the cornbread. This place went from a treat to a disaster in one horrible visit. Won't be back unless and until they literally halve their prices and go back to the quality hole-in-the-wall they used to be. At least they accept credit cards now - only took them a half century to figure that out.

We saw this restaurant featured on Check Please Arizona and being from the south, we were excited to try it.  I decided to take my husband there for his birthday.  Let me start off with the review of the food - it was terrible.  The chicken was greasy, and had no flavor.  The sides were as bad as a school cafeteria.  But the service is even worse!  We arrived around 1:30 on a Saturday.  There were 2 large tables of people and a few other tables but still lots of empty tables (the place is pretty small).  We chose a table in the back - huge mistake, because it reeked of the smells from the bathroom.  But I wanted to try to stay positive since it was my husband's birthday.  We waited only a few minutes before a waiter came by to give us menus and get our drink order.  We ordered non-sweet tea - however, we got one sweet and one non-sweet, we were able to get that remedied, but when the waiter came back to give us the tea, he wouldn't take our order even though we said we were ready.  He said he had to get a pencil and paper and would be back. Well, he didn't come back for almost 45 minutes!  That's not to say he wasn't around, when the large table's food was ready, the brought out the plates one by one - several minutes apart.  Several other tables came in during this time, while we were still waiting to order, he actually took he new tables orders before ours!  Finally, I spoke up next time he was in our vicinity and told him we still hadn't ordered.  Even after this, it took him about 10 minutes to come back!  We should have walked out, but now it was a mission to see how long it would take.  After we ordered, we waited again.  At some point, a man came out and asked a table near us, but who had came in well after us, how long they had been waiting, and this nice lady told him that our table had been waiting longer than hers.  Turns out, they got their food before we did!  In fact several tables that came in after us got food before us.  Finally, we got our food and let me say that I have had better fried chicken from KFC - I actually think they might have gotten the chicken from KFC, because I don't remember the smell of chicken frying in the restaurant.  And of course they got our sides wrong.  At the end of our meal, a lady came by again to the table near us and apologized for the delay and asked if she could provide a dessert on the house, again the nice lady customer informed the employee that in fact we had been there much longer than them, The employee then just looked at us and reluctantly came to our table and asked us if we wanted dessert.  Having lived in the south, I am familiar with racial tensions, and I have read the other Yelpers mentioning the disparity of service for non-dark customers, this place is worse than anything I have ever experienced.  Two hours waiting for a lunchtime meal!  That's CRAZY!  I felt unwelcome and unimportant to the business.  I will never go there again.  And after all of that, it was $34.00!!

I got the catfish sandwich and cabbage, so delicious. My hubby got fried chicken, mac n cheese, and sweet potatoes. Everything tasted great and the portions where big.

I think this restaurant must've recently opened because I didn't notice it when I was visiting last year.  I love catfish and so decided to give it a try.  As I walked up to it,  I first noticed that from a distance it looks nice (nice sign is what attracted me) but as I approached I saw it was very barren looking.  It really didn't look appealing at all.  The girl at the cash register had samples and so I had one and it was good so I ordered a 6 piece catfish meal with a side of onion rings and cole slaw.  I asked about the cole slaw and the girl behind the counter said it was \"really good\".  I placed my order.  I attempted to pay but there was a problem with the cash register so she went in back to get someone to help her and a young man came out.  He looked like he was the cook.  He punched some keys on they register and showed her what was wrong and then went to the back.  First thing I noticed was that he used the register keys and didn't have gloves on.  Anyway, I paid and she said it would be ready in 10 minutes.  After about 5 minutes I walked up and my order was ready.  First of all, the cole slaw is so sweet.  It is not \"really good\".  It has too much slaw sauce on it.  Much too sweet.  The onion rings tasted good.  The catfish was really and I mean really deep fried.  It didn't taste exactly like the sample I had tasted at the counter.  I couldn't really taste the catfish, just the deep fried batter.  The red dip that came with it was just extremely hot.  I don't know what it was but it didn't help the flavor of the catfish.  But I was hungry so I ate the catfish.  Here's what really made me angry and caused me to write this review though:  When I was down to the last two pieces of fish I noticed the styrofoam underneath it was eaten away.  I realized that they must've set the very hot fish directly in the styrofoam tray and it had melted the styrofoam and I had eaten it!!!  I just thought how could someone be so unaware that this could happen??\n\nI don't really want this place to close as I think the catfish idea is a good one.  It wouldn't take much to spruce the place up.  Train the employees and make sure they know how to be friendly to the customers. Teach them customer service.   Get rid of the styrofoam or use paper.  They could have also asked me if I was going to eat there or take it as they could save money on plastic bags by not using them for every order.  People order their food, walk 15 feet away and throw the bag in the garbage.  You need a plastic bag for this?  Lot's of unconscious thinking going on at this place.  If no changes are made, I will really be surprised if they are still in business when I visit Arizona again next year.\n\nPOSTSCRIPT:  A reviewer reminded me that not everyone's food preferences are the same so as to my stating the coleslaw was too sweet, let me say that even though I might have thought it was too sweet, others might not think so and may actually prefer it this way.

Even if you're in the sourest of moods when you enter the restaurants, your conversation with the effervescent Mell will brighten your day.\n\nWhat you need to know:\n* The fried chicken is the star attraction at Melly Mels.  The meat is juicy and far more delectable than any $7 plate of chicken has any right to be.  The coating is has a wonderful crunch, not greasy at all.  Best of all, it is served piping hot - there are no heat lamps at Melly Mel's - everything is made to order.  With a little hot sauce sprinkled on top, eating this fried chicken was a near life-altering event...\n* There is an extensive breakfast menu.  It has the usual fare (eggs, pancakes, bacon, sausage, etc.) as well as chicken and waffles.\n* The lunch deals are a fantastic bargain.  For $7, you get a generous main course, two sides and a drink.\n* The sides were hit or miss for me.  I loved the cornbread muffin and the fried potatoes and onions.  The black-eyed peas and rice & gravy not so much.  The yams and the mac and cheese ordered by my dining companions looked promising.\n* If you are looking for a quick meal, this is not the place to go.  Because of the made to order nature of the food and the volume of carry out orders, give yourself a good hour and a half for lunch.\n\nMy last piece of advice: DO NOT LEAVE UNTIL YOU ORDER DESSERT.  I love, love, love, love, love, love the desserts at Melly Mells.  On my first visit, I had the strawberry cake with a smooth cream cheese frosting.  My second visit featured a lemon pound cake.  Both were out of the oven fresh and both were Oh.So.Delicious. 'nuf said.

He chose the chicken wings, catfish, along with grits, potatoes, and toast. Just a shout out to the Catfish. It was hot, moist, delicious flavor and one of the best crusted coating batters i have ever had. Southerners everywhere would be proud. Grits were creamy and cooked perfect. Awesome all the way around.\n\nI ordered the chicken and waffles. Really was looking forward to trying this, and I was not dissapointed. You get 4 large chicken wings.

Good thing the BF and I have an eye out for food places all the time 'cuz we're always hungry.  From the outside, there's not much to look out.  It occupies a corner spot and after walking in, you can see tables lined up past the counter to the back.\n\nWe were told to take a seat anywhere we liked and after sliding into our booth, menus were brought over.  The waitress came by to ask if she could get us beverages and you gotta get Sweet Tea ($1.50)!  (Yum! Yum!)  \n\nPerusing through the menu, we decided to split an order since dinner was happening in a couple of hours.  We opted for the whole order of Shorts Ribs with gravy ($17.99), which is \"slowly cooked beef ribs, seasoned to perfection with gravy or BBQ.\"  The whole orders come with three sides and our choice was the collared greens, macaroni and cheese, and fried okra.  (Check out the picture!)  A half order was available for $12.99, but  I'm not sure how many sides you get with the half orders.\n\nThe wait wasn't too long for our order to come, despite the warning on the menu saying there's a 20 minute wait for fried items.\n\nThe short ribs were tender and came off the bone easily.  It was flavorful and went well with the gravy.  The macaroni and cheese was a bit bland for my tastes though, but the collared greens fared a bit better.  The BF said they could have cooked the greens a bit longer for what he likes.  We especially liked the fried okra though.  It was my first time having that and we wished we had two orders of it instead.  \n\nOther sides available included yams, black eyed peas, red beans and rice, potato salad, corn bread dressing, cabbage, string beans, and rice and gravy.  Entrees included oxtail, catfish, chitterlings, gumbo, meatloaf, fried chicken, and liver and onions.  Dessert choices were peach cobbler, sweet potato pie, and banana pudding.  \n\nService was good.  The waitress refilled our sweet tea before we had to ask and before we were even done with our first glass.  We definitely appreciate that.  She also brought out an extra plate for us so we could share our entree.  And she asked if we wanted any dessert before giving us the bill too.\n\nOverall, the sweet tea, ribs, and fried okra were good.  The other sides were just okay.  We felt that it was a bit pricey for what we got, and both expected a larger platter of ribs.  We wouldn't mind going back to try out what else they had to offer.\n\nSidenote: I'm not sure if it's intimidating or not seeing this very tall man  wiping down tables as his gun and badge bounce off his hip.     \n\nThere's an 18% gratuity added for parties of six or more.\n\nUpdate! 03/14/08 - The BF was craving their short ribs, so we ordered them up again.  This time they were  A  LOT more generous with their portions!  (It makes me wonder if we got shafted the last time - check it out and compare the pictures yourself!)  I wish we remembered not to get the mac n cheese, but we got black-eyed peas and fried okra this time too.\n\nI went for the Small Seafood Gumbo which had crab (hard to eat), chunky sausage, chicken, okra, and rice.  It's pretty generous for a small portion, but there's not all that much seafood in it.  It's super gooey from all the okra 'stuff' though.  \n\nThis time we got complimentary cornbread pancakes, two each and a side of butter.  What a nice treat while you peruse the menu.

It has been a while.\n\nI've been to M&M a few times before. My most recent visit had to be the most notable of them all. I usually roll with the fried catfish dish (very good), but today, I decided to go for the chicken & waffles (faint-worthy). Here's a rundown of what I have tried:\n\n***Chicken & Waffles - By far, my favorite dish here (and my favorite waffles of all time). The waffles have an airy, incredibly fluffy consistency. It is practically melts in your mouth with each bite. I actually have to admit that these even surpass the famous Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles over in L.A. While the chicken wings themselves, did not wow me as much as the waffles did, they did have a delightful crisp, with a nice touch of seasoning.\n***Fried catfish - I am a catfish junkie. Suffice to say, M&M does serve up a great plate of catfish. If you're in the mood for crispy, flaky, and well seasoned pieces of fish, you can't go wrong with this order. Note: Half order includes 1 catfish + 2 sides. You may want to go for a full order if your stomach demands it.  I paired my half-order of catfish with fried okra and black eyed peas. Just like they sound, they did my body good.\n***Cornbread pancakes - These come free to your table as something to munch on while waiting for food. They are usually incredibly fluffy and fall apart with a savory crumble with each bite, but my most recent visit came off a little dry.\n***Muddy water - Pretty much a drink like an Arnold Palmer. Half iced tea, half lemonade. Their lemonade really does pack a sweet punch, so it does stand out above the usual Arnold Palmer.\n\nThe wait for the food was a little on the long side. We must have waited 20-30 minutes for our plates to arrive. The friendly staff made sure my coffee mug was never empty. Plus, the cornbread pancakes continuously came to our table to plump us up during the wait.\n\nAs they say, soul food sticks to your ribs. Over here at M&M Soul Food Cafe, not only did the food stick to my ribs, rear-end, and whatever flab that was hanging off of my body, it did also ingrain itself a spot in my brain as my favorite spot for chicken and waffles.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 7, "useful": 10, "cool": 7}}, {"text": "Soul food in Vegas?

Once we assured them we wanted to eat, all was well and we were seated. We ordered the smothered fried chicken and the pork chops, with mac and cheese and okra for sides. Everything was super good. The fried chicken skin was crispy and the chicken itself was juicy. The gravy was typical southern brown gravy deliciousness. No complaints on the mac and cheeses or okra either. I actually restrained myself a bit and saved room for banana pudding. My sister had never had southern style banana pudding and she was floored.

I ordered the fried chicken wings and waffles, of course, as I am a huge fan of this dish and order it whenever it's on the menu. The ONLY time I eat fried chicken is when It's accompanied with a buttered waffle and smothered in maple syrup. If I'm gonna go, I wanna go all the way. Wings are not my preferred piece of  the chicken but that is a small thing and I'm willing to overlook it because the waffles were awesome. Perfectly soft, chewy texture and I'm pretty sure I detected a hint of cinnamon. They were a perfect compliment to the fried chicken. I might be spoiled for this dish at any other restaurant. \n\nThe catfish plate with two eggs, grits and toast was really tasty too. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the grits didn't require any doctoring up. They were good without any added butter or sugar. The third breakfast entree was corn beef hash. I didn't try it, not really my thing.  I'm guessing it was good though because there wasn't one bite left on the plate. \n\nThis building is in a state of slight disrepair.

Although I hardly ever eat it now, I was raised on soul food in a family of the best soul food cooks ever. Today was my birthday and my partner surprised me with a trip to M &M. The facility seems very much updated from some of the pics that I've seen on Yelp. It has the feel of a diner. It was very clean and comfortable. I will say that I was a little paranoid with the security guard in front of me with a gun. Interesting, but I suppose I should be happy. \n\nThe food...to my surprise...VERY GOOD! I had mac & cheese, collard greens, and potato salad. Oh...dare I forget...chitterlings. I was politely corrected...chitlins...I was always corrected as a child too... The corn bread that they bring before the meal was amazing. It was round, light, sweet, and YUM. Then came the meal. The collards were superbly cooked and seasoned. The potato salad was delectable. The mac & cheese was a tad dry,  but good. The \"chitterlings\" were scrumptious...people passed my table and were asking how they were. I think in general, people are scared to eat them. DON'T BE SCARED....just order and enjoy. My partner ordered rice and beans(just ok), yams (very sweet and good), and BBQ chicken. I was very disappointed in the chicken only because it seemed as if they took their baked chicken and put BBQ sauce on it. That's not BBQ chicken. The baked chicken was good and the BBQ sauce was good, but it wasn't BBQ chicken. Lol...\n\nThe service was really good. Our server was friendly, attentive, and helpful with food choices.

Probably should have known that the wait was going to be a little longer than usual. \n\nWhen we walked in, the place was PACKED. The poor little waitresses were running around trying to serve everyone as best they could, but the amount of people seemed to be overwhelming. I'm pretty forgiving so the wait (which was close to an hour and fifteen minutes WITH a toddler) was ALRIGHT. Good thing I had my phone full of kid-apps to keep my little guy entertained. Our waitress probably popped over like 2 times in that hour and fifteen minutes. I feel like she could have popped over a few MORE times, but she seemed so exhausted and overwhelmed, I really just felt bad for her. \n\nWhat really bothered me was our food. First off the served us these little corn cakes, but after waiting forty minutes, I contemplated asking the waitress to give us two more batches because we were famished at that point. \n\nWhen the rest of our food came out (fried chicken, greens, beans, mac n cheese for my boyfriend and another order of fried chicken, this time smothered in gravy and the same sides for me and my little guy) My boyfriends food was hot but I found it odd that mine was cold. I feel like they fried the chicken, left it out for an hour to cool, THEN dumped the luke warm gravy on it. The sides were pretty good. The collards were very flavorful and had a little kick, the beans had just the right amount of seasoning and the mac n cheese was creamy but it would have been nice to have a little bit more cheese. \n\nAGAIN, the place was EXTREMELY busy and I'm pretty forgiving; just maybe keep in mind what day you try to come in. And really, I can wait for a while before I start to get really agitated, but I just ask that my food be HOT when it comes out ESPECIALLY having to wait that long.

I ordered without hesitation the Chicken N' Waffles (which is served all day and all night long) and my party placed an order for the Smothered Fried Chicken and the Seafood Gumbo.

Despite the afternoon rush, our server was very un-rushed, attentive and kept it coming with the cornbread!  The fried chicken and waffles came out in a dish of 3 chicken wings and 2 waffles with a side of butter and syrup.  The wings were fried to saving grace perfection.  Not too salty and not too greasy either.  The waffles were soft and delicious and it seemed like they were made from the same cornbread ingredients.  My life is f'n good.

Obviously not brought up on \"Soul Food\" but raised close enough to Detroit that it played a big part in childhood memories I've since sought out, those looking for collards, chitlins, or gumbo should be aware that none are available before noon on weekends (despite the online annotated 11am,) nor is fried chicken beyond the wing (though if you ask nicely they may be able to accommodate after a substantial delay...IE, the thigh arrived with dessert,)  and moving past these inconveniences be advised that service, while friendly, is constrained - a pair of young ladies and an elderly fellow managing a capacity crowd of ~80 with wait times up to an hour during my stay.  Moving past the 'issues' and onto the food and d\u00e9cor suffice it to say that the interior replicates the fa\u00e7ade and with a small kitchen at work behind makeshift walls the food arrived at an awkward pace with mixed results, particularly in the proteins where both pork chop and breast were dry and flavorless despite excellent, crispy breading while the thigh was expectedly more succulent but also far better seasoned, as if from an entirely different batch.  Speaking to the rest, mostly carbs and a pair of over easy eggs, it was in these items that M&M shined - the waffles a soft wheat batter and the 'cornbread' a pair of pan fried flapjacks needing only a touch of syrup to balance the savory notes, something neither the sweet potato pie nor the banana pudding would require at all - the former a well done classic and the second far more dense than any take on the dish I've found and all the better for it, a sort of bread pudding made with only a bit of liquid and a lot of ripe bananas juxtaposing softened nilla wafers.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 3, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Why is this place so loved? We've been wanting to know and finally tried them.

My partner had fried catfish, the same sides, plus potato salad, along with chitlins, since you can't find them easily. \n\nFirst, they brought out pancake-style cornbread that tasted a bit like a greased skillet.  My partner's entree arrived several minutes before mine, so I got a preview of my side dishes.  We were both surprised at the lack of seasoning. The dressing was a soft, gritty serving with no discernible flavoring other than some sage. No onion, salt, pepper- very odd.   The macaroni and cheese was somewhat hard, with congealed clumps of cheese. The potato salad was more like mashed-potato salad, the flavor wasn't horrible but it was mostly of sweet pickles. \n\nMy BBQ chicken was a huge disappointment. Just a small, baked, drumstick and thigh with bottled sauce (it appears) poured over them. Huh? My partner's full serving of catfish was largely devoid of seasoning, although it was cooked all right. The extra $4 for the third side and half a piece of fish was not worth the price. \n\nThe first bite of chitlins went into a napkin and were declared \"awful.\"  I'm no chitlin eater- the smell alone was making me gag, but my partner, who has both eaten and cooked them, couldn't stomach these. \n\nThe server was pleasant but never cleared the table or asked how we liked the food.

They had also been breaded and fried, but they remained succulent. All the sides were outstanding, to a great extent because they're not loaded with salt. The cabbage was nice and sweet, and the mac and cheese gooey and rich (although I have to say that Bobby Q is still has my #1).

Get there... now. Payton is known for pushing limits and incorporating fresh, local ingredients. The menu will likely change every week, if not every night, so I'm not sure if my recap will help all that much, but here goes.\n\nThe neighborhood is sketchy, the place is tiny, and the accommodations are \"rustic\", so if you're all into the Scottsdale scene or flashing your dough, don't bother. That being said, Shantal mentioned that being there made her feel like she was camping every night, and I have to admit the evening had a vacation feel to it... National Lampoon's style!\n\nYou can instantly tell that Payton is having a blast and it shows on his face and in the food. We were seated on a collection of old dining chairs at a makeshift table of 2x8s and construction horses in the middle of the front yard, with a candle to light our way... I knew it was going to be a sweet evening!\n\nWe started with the burrata that was lightly seasoned with truffle oil and cracked pepper. Unfortunately a lot of people are adding burrata to their menus and they have no idea that this fresh, creamy, delicate version is how it's truly meant to be. It was served with slices of toast that I expected to be the brick-hard version to which I've become accustomed. Imagine my surprise as I bit into a spongy, buttery slice of bread with just a crunch of the crust! Delicious.\n\nThe porcini foie gras terrine will scare those faint of heart, but it's amazing and the pear butter adds this velvety, sweet flavor that just makes it unforgettable. I wasn't a fan of the pate', but it was a combination of pickle, horseradish, and mustard flavors with chunks in the loaf... all things I can personally only handle in moderation individually and generally dislike, so it was exactly as described. The mains arrived and the Sonoma lamb sugo proved to be an interesting choice. It's not something you would eat on a regular basis, but I'm so glad I got to try it. The shreds of lamb meat were piled on top of a bowl of hearty fettuccine with perfectly cooked chickpeas and dollops of cream that muted any gaminess of the meat. Then you would get a bite of golden raisin to kick in a touch of sweetness; pretty cool combination of flavors and textures without being over the top.\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise of the night was the bowl of Bolognese that was planted in front of us, it blew me away and I have no idea why!! Payton, what's your secret with something so simple? Dessert followed with apple pie that could've been much tastier if it were warmed with a scoop of ice cream, but all was rescued with a huge chunk of bread pudding that puts my mother's recipe to shame (and it was served warmed with a scoop of ice cream :). \n\nAll in all, we had a wonderful night with fabulous food and fun friends and we didn't want the night to end. If you want a hint of adventure, get to Welcome Diner before the end of May... seriously...

Chef, I hear, tries to keep it real and keep it local and fresh when sourcing his menu, so it changes each week.  McClendon's Select was mentioned more than once.\n\n(PRICE NOTE:  On Tuesdays from 10pm-close, the menu is 1/2 price to be sure Curry exhausts his fresh produce and meats.)\n\nWelcome Diner was serving about 12 people when we arrived, 6 at the inside counter and three couples outside dotting the front yard, set up with a picnic table, a sawhorse, some two tops, and glass tabletop lanterns.\n\nThe food came out quickly, and our gracious and knowledgeable server asked if we'd like our dishes as they were prepared or in courses. We opted for the former.  My darling dining partner and I shared all four dishes.\n\nTHOSE DAMN GREEN BEANS\nWe started with green beans, as crisp as they were picked, with just one tip snapped off, just like my grandmother taught me.  These were served with a citrus creme fraiche and some recently picked tarragon.  I always love dairy with tarragon, and this dish, served cool (not cold) if I remember, was dusted with local bee pollen, granular bits that taste of honey and something else and melt on your tongue.\n\nMOZZARELLA\nThe menu insists there's basil in this tangential rendition of caprese -- and there probably is -- but the takeaway message from this panko-encrusted slab of mozzarella with the sweetest tomatoes I've eaten is a sweet-n-sour burst with every olive oily bite.  A standout appetizer.\n\nGNOCCHI\nIf you're like me, when you've eaten or prepared gnocchi before, you assume they get plopped into the boiling salted water before the plump up and rise to the surface.  Not so fast, Barilla Boy.  Payton Curry's gnocchi, I believe, are (dry?) pan-seared on both sides,   keeping all the doughy, gummy deliciousness often lost in the water.  The madeira wine and cream reduction here smothers the pillowy gnocchi and tooth-tender walnuts and squiggly good morel mushrooms in a way that makes you close your eyes, shut off your hearing, and attempt to pour all of your sensory energy into taste and smell.  When eating this dish, I more than once covered my face with my hand to shield what may have been unflattering facial pangs of ecstasy.  \n\nLEMON CURD\nWe struggled to choose this dessert over the Strawberry Olive Oil Cake and Strawberry Malt, but we got our strawberry fix as the second layer in this delectable parfait, topped with the airiest foamy meringue, and served in a mason jar.  The macerated strawberries made you want to relive childhood and replace mom's jelly with Payton's strawberries to accompany Laura Scudder in your PB&J sandwich.  We clanged spoons at the bottom of the jar for the last bit of bee pollen.\n\n$62 with tax and tip.  We didn't bring a BYOB wine but would next time.  (The $13 corkage fee seems high, but there ought to be an explanation for that.)  Everyone working in the tiny dinette and serving the tables outside had huge smiles and loads of enthusiasm for what they were contributing to the Garfield neighborhood and to the downtown culinary scene.  Others are taking notice, too. Michelle Laudig (former restaurant critic at Phoenix New Times) and Aaron Chamberlin of St. Francis both dropped in during our dinner.\n\nI worry about the AZ heat baking the charm out of patio dining in May, \nJune, and July for Chef Curry, but I hope to return in April...maybe on a Tuesday at 10pm for half-price eats.\n\nOther reviews of Payton Curry's chef-in-residence at Welcome Diner: http://www.yelp.com/biz/payton-curry-at-welcome-diner-phoenix", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "This place is DEFINITELY NOT CLOSED.

The combination of flavors on the puerco thing was just delicious.  And the hashbrowns were fresh and not too crispy and not overpowering and flavorful.  I kind of wanted some sour cream to go with the flavors and make them like a crunchy baked potato.\n\nThe beignets are not as fluffy as the ones I remember in New Orleans but definitely will satisfy this girls desire for fried dough.

I got the mimosa while she got the bloody mary.  I'm not sure what they put in those drinks, but they had some kick!  They weren't overtly alcoholic, but just spicier than other mimosas or bloody marys I've had.  As for the food, I came here for one thing.  A biscuit sandwich.  More specifically, the Big Jim.  Fried chicken, country gravy, bacon, and cheddar on a homemade biscuit.  Unreal.  The biscuit was flaky, buttery heaven.  The batter on the fried chicken was delicious and the gravy wonderfully hearty.  Easily the best biscuit sandwich I've had in the Phoenix area.  My girlfriend got the Andouille Scramble which was basically an omelette with andouille sausage, peppers and onions with a side of potatoes.

I was desperately looking for a place that would take my rush holiday pie order and after a dozen \"No's\", Angie's sweet kindness let me in from the dark and shined a light on me that warms me to this day.  She said that she didn't exactly have anything ready, but asked me to come in and we would \"talk\"; Southern speak for, \"we'll work it out\".   \nWhen I had arrived at the location, a lady greeted me with a hearty hello and called for Angie to come out from the back.   Based on her enthusiasm, I just naturally assumed I was speaking with Angie.  When Angie came out with her big smile, I reminded her of who I am and she hesitatingly said that she does have a pie but it's in her personal pie tin and not very professional looking.  I excitedly exclaimed, \"That's PERFECT!\"  I know I'm dragging on here but what I want you to see is that Angie and the lady who greeted me so enthusiastically, who I later found out was Angie's Mother, are the most kind, humble and positive people I've met in a long time.  \n\nI took the pie, which was a great deal, with a small stack of menus and delivered the pie to my friends with a copy of the menu.  On my way back home, I was hungry for lunch so I called Angie's and placed a \"take out\" order.  If you decide to visit Angie's I recommend calling in advance and order \"take out\".  \n\nAlways on the prowl for home cooking and fried chicken I ordered the... Now don't judge.  I intended to buy part 1 for lunch and part 2 for dinner but sometimes the food is just too good and well...you know...things happen.  Anyway, I ordered the nine piece wings and fries and for my \"intended\" dinner, I ordered the fried chicken dinner with two sides: Collard Greens and Red Beans and Rice.  Angie said it will be ready in 30 minutes.  I also wanted to stop by to let the ladies know how much my friends I and appreciated and loved the sweet potato pie.   When I told Angie, she was very grateful for the positive feedback.\n\nNow to the good stuff... My orders came in two, 3-section, Styrofoam, to-go boxes inside a plastic bag.  I could feel the heat on my fingers and smell the scent of fried chicken emanating from the bag.  I got in my car and barely got the key in the ignition before I had that knot on that bag ripped open like an excited five year old on Christmas morning.  I popped open that first Styrofoam container and found a mound of REAL French fried potatoes, and NINE golden chicken wings.  Remember that scene from \"Pulp Fiction\" where the briefcase was opened and a gold glow was cast on the face of John Travolta?  That was me.  Do not tell on me but I am driving during this segment of the review.  I'm hungry and going to \"nibble\" a bit while I drive.   My first pull, I took in one fry and was blown away with it's freshness and that \"comfort food\" feeling it gave me;  hot, fresh, perfectly salty and real food not processed or \"extruded\"     Now I'm pulling up four and five fries per reach.  They are hot and moist and taste so good but then my fingers touch a faint rough texture versus the smoothness of the French Fry.  It's the first tactile introduction of the fried CHICKEN WINGS!!!  I'm at a stop light now and can use both hands to pull apart the pointy side of the wing.  Not much meat but I love the crunch and it's perfectly seasoned!!!   So nice and so good!  I then place the center piece with the moist flesh covered by the fried, crispy, salty goodness.  Not sure where the bones went.  Then la piece de la resistance, the meaty end; not huge like some hormone fed Frankenchicken, but perfect.  I can't put it to words.  You're just going to have to get your lips on some so you can feel the love.  \n\nI live about 6 miles from Angie's, a drive I barely remember.  When I pulled onto my street, I discovered I was not wearing my seat-belt!  I ALWAYS wear my seat belt!  I can't remember a time when I didn't wear it.  This is some amazing food!  \n\nI pulled into my garage looking at the passenger seat, there is one more box left.  The debate erupts in my head, \"put it away, \"just have a taste\", \"put it away\", \"just one bite\"...back and forth, but gluttony won this day. I sat at my dinner table with fork and napkins...plural.  Intending to just \"taste\" the collards and red beans and rice, then retire the rest of the meal for dinner I soon realized that I should have just walked away and put the box in the refrigerator.  First bite and it was over.  The Collards were seasoned perfectly and so tender with  bite sized chucks of smoked ham hock and the red beans and rice reminded me of food my Grand Mother, who's from Jefferson County Alabama, used to make.  I was sucked in.  Then there is the perfect mounds of happiness in the cornbread.   Next thing I know, the plate's empty.  Only the bones remained and I'm stuffed.  This is genuinely one of those great meals where the food tastes so good you just keep eating no matter how full you are.  \n\nAmen", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 5, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "Thanks yet again to the Yelp app for finding my lunch.  I typed in \"soul food,\" and this place appeared.  It had half a dozen glowing reviews, so we decided to give it a shot.  Very glad we did.  Angie is very friendly, I stopped by before we ate and got a to go menu.  She advised me to call and order what we wanted, as the food is cooked to order, and it is not quick.  This is totally fine with me, I find that generally, the quicker stuff is, the less \"real\" it is.  And usually, the better it tastes when it takes some time to cook.\n\nThere are some mainstays on the menu (fried or smothered chicken, for example), and there are daily specials.  We ate at Angie's on a Thursday, when meatloaf is the special.  So, my wife had meatloaf.  This is a traditional meatloaf, tomato sauce, onions, veggies.  Very moist, went well with the mashed potatoes and brown gravy.  We also tried mac n cheese, fried corn, and okra.  Of these, the okra was my least favorite, but I still really liked it.  The fried corn has bacon and veggies in it, it was a style we hadn't tried before.  Both of us liked it.  I'd like to try to replicate this dish at home.  The mac n cheese, as expected, was fantastic.  Classic soul food mac, not based on a roux.  Very cheesy.  \n\nI had the fried chicken.  I was glad I called ahead, because this dish can take 25-30 minutes.  Again, I don't mind since it's fresh, but I highly recommend you call first.  This is a LARGE serving of chicken, 4 pieces, with 2 very large drumsticks.  Both meals at $9.99 for the entr\u00e9e, 2 sides, and cornbread.  Very reasonable considering the flavor and quality of what you get.  The fried chicken was seasoned very well.  I find that a lot of places are too focused on the skin, which is certainly important, and leave out proper seasoning.  Not Angie.  The skin was crispy, adhered to the chicken, and was flavorful.  That's the fried chicken trifecta.\n\nThe employees were very friendly.  The place is small and sparsely decorated, but we felt very comfortable.

She really made our experience great from her lovely personality and excellent service.\n\nNow to the important part.....The food!  We are a southern family and wanted some of our go-to comfort foods, fried chicken and fried catfish.    The fried chicken was just like the chicken we used to get in Tennessee at my grandma's dinner table.  The catfish tasted like the catfish from Mississippi and my childhood.  My mom swears that the catfish is the best she has eaten outside of the South.  I can't argue with that statement because it was YUMMY.  \n\nWe also ordered the mashed potatoes, mac n' cheese, red beans & rice, and fries as side items.  Everything was amazing!

I rated Kathy's Southern Cooking 2-stars for the following reasons. #1 Customer Service/ Etiquette was very poor. In my opinion when an order is placed and you do not have that particular item (i.e. Peach Cobbler) available at that moment, you are to express a little sympathy or at least be a TINY bit apologetic for that item not being available at the customers request. To ask the customer \"What do you want me to do about it\"? Is extremely rude!!! I would have gladly waited for said item had the man at the front counter had a different approach. I took off 2 stars just for this particular reason. There are certain ways you should speak to people. I understand that when cooking any southern meal/food that it takes a bit of time. I was very excited when I walked into this establishment. Poor service etiquette is very unacceptable. And #2 Food was just above average. I ordered a catfish dinner for myself w/ a side of greens & also ordered a chicken dinner & a hot-link w/ banana pudding for someone else. We both agreed that the Mac N' Cheese was at best rated a 1 out of 10. It tasted exactly like the Mac n cheese from KFC! The greens that I ordered were very good w/ hot sauce. They weren't seasoned heavily at all, I assume to give you the option to add seasoning yourself. The mashed potatoes & gravy were delicious! No complaints. The hot-link was covered in BBQ sauce & was regular, nothing too good or too bad. I have tasted better, I'm not sure where they get theirs from. Both the catfish and the chicken were good!!! The batter for both was good as well! And the banana pudding was pretty tasty. I did not get to try the cornbread that was supposed to be included with my dinner because unfortunately, they left it out. My overall opinion is that the food is good, the service is extremely poor.

This was a LOT of food for about $11.75 as I recall.  I may be off on the price, but you get 2 large slices of meatloaf in addition to corn bread and the 2 sides.  Beyond reasonable.  The meatloaf slices were hefty, we took basically a whole slice home.  Moist, flavorful, and covered in a fantastic brown gravy.  This is a classic version of the dish, and it's a great representation.  \n\nI had the fried chicken, which, as other yelpers note, does not come out quickly.  But, it's worth the wait.  I had a breast, thigh and leg.  You have to pay $1.00 more if you want to choose your 3 pieces, which I did because I don't care for wings.  The meal is still a great value even if you had the extra dollar.  The chicken is HOT, you can tell it's freshly made.  All 3 pieces are juicy, even the white meat.  The skin has a great crunch and seasoning.  Definite repeat.\n\nThe iced tea is sweet and it's fantastic.  But, they have it at room temperature.

I had two wings and a breast and they were all moist on the inside, no dry choking hazard white meat here. The greens were good, perfectly seasoned, made me wish I had some pepper juice ( its a down south thing when they get some peppers put them in a jar with what I think is vinegar and let it sit on a shelf for a couple weeks, its bomb on greens ) I could tell the mashed potatoes were made from real mashed potatoes, and that brown gravy on top was no joke. My whole meal was delicious in every meaning of the word. I pressed my girl for some of her ox tails and they were delicious as well, tender, nice size and flavor on point.

Yay!  Another venue offering soul food with candied yams on the menu!!  Since none of the employees could answer my food allergy concerns that afternoon, I'd have to call the next morning.\n\nEarlier today I was able to get my food issues cleared and decided I'd have a late lunch (or early dinner) of BBQ platter with three meats (choice of beef brisket, chicken on the bone, pulled pork, or rib tips).  I ordered the meats dry since the BBQ had allergens.  Dinners come with two sides and cornbread, so I chose candied yams and brown sugar baked beans and asked that the cornbread be packaged to go.\n\n(Before I placed my order, I asked if I could sample the meat since the last time I tried BBQ meats on the dry side, I found them quite tasteless; the cook was more than happy to hand me a sample of the brisket.)\n\nLiked the brisket; the meat was so tender and moist and  tasted like a smoky version of corned beef.  The chicken was good, too, but the meat was still red and slightly raw when I sliced into it for a peek underneath.  I showed it to the server who started to say that the chicken is usually served that way, but she took it back for more time in the oven when I asked.  Unfortunately, the chicken was very charred when it was returned to me.  I was able to salvage most of it after scraping the burnt skin off.  While the first two meats were delicious on their own, w/o BBQ sauce, the rib tips did not fare so well.  I liked the texture of the meat, but it definitely could use more complexity. \n\nWhile I was able to determine that the dessert menu (outside source so info on ingredients wasn't easily available) is pretty much off-limits to me, I am not in the least disheartened...  The candied yams and brown sugar baked beans (both made from in-house recipes) were so delectable and sweet, they're almost like dessert, but with added benefits- vitamins, fiber, and protein!  Mmm... LOVED the spices used to flavor the yams.  Yes, there are the usual suspects of butter, cinnamon, and brown sugar, but I detect something else... almond extract!  Go and have a try yourself and see if you can help me detect what these flavors are :)  And the baked beans!  Red peppers and hatch green chilies really make this side dish sing!  \n\nBeans, beans, the musical fruit...  \n\nBreakfast menu is served all day [steak and eggs, biscuits and gravy (thickened w/ cornstarch), scrambles, and country burritos, to name a few], and lunch and dinner menus [fried chicken and (Belgian) waffles, burgers, wings, BBQ tacos and wraps, sandwiches and po'boys, chicken fried steaks, etc.] start at 11a.  I'm already looking forward to taking my grandmother and cousin here on my next weekend off!\n\nNotes to owners/manager:  \n\n1.This easily could've been a four-star review, but I thought it poor form to send back a badly-charred chicken.  I didn't think it was wrong of me to send back the bloody leg... (Ring!!  \"Hello, Salmonella poisoning, How may I hurt you?\") \n\n2. I was told that the addition of sweet potato fries is being considered- please don't take too long to decide Yes! :D \n(With a good dusting of cinnamon-sugar, please!)\n\n3. Please change your font printing on the front and back take-home menu covers.  The current choice (white print on black and superimposed on a white background) is almost illegible.\n\n4. Kudos on having DEDICATED fryers for your fried fish (batter contains corn), chicken, and other meats (fried pork chops and chicken fried steaks)!!

I'd heard about it from others like some sort of ancient mythology - it sounds amazing and fantastical but you know it can't really be true.  When it comes to Lo-Lo's - believe the hype.\n\nFinding Lo-Lo's: I've driven down Central SO many times and never known how close I really was.  Then one day I saw an arrow spray painted on the side of the building.  \"Lo-Lo's this way!\"  It took a few minutes to realize that that must be THE Lo-Lo's.  I started talking about it w/ friends and we decided we needed to go.  I confirmed the address and the 3 of us set off for flavor adventure.  Yes, you turn at the arrow (Which you only see when driving North on Central) and it's not much at all past that - but don't expect any huge signs, valet service - or even a parking lot.  You'll park right out on the street - and on a busy night that means you may need to walk a bit.\n\nEntering Lo-Lo's:  Stepping through the doors = Waiting area.  Taking 2 steps into Lo-Lo's = Standing in front of someone's table while they are eating.  You can tell this used to be someone's house - and it was a small house at that.  There are just a few \"rooms\" for seating - and the largest has 5 tables.  Our first time there we sat in the room that has just two tables - a 4 and a 2 top - but it's also where the cash register is, where folks pick up to go orders, where they refill the drinks/silverware, where they store extra items that were purchased in bulk and has the doorway to the kitchen and you have to walk through that room to get to the other rooms.  In some places you might think this was the worst table in the house.  At Lo-Lo's I would disagree with you.  We got to listen in on the best conversations and we had the best view of all the amazing food going to the different rooms.  \n\nThe Food:  Sweet Tea served in a big Mason Jar.  SOLD!  It was awesome and the refills kept coming.  Soul Food without Sweet Tea is just wrong to me.  As for the rest of the Menu - it's not 30 pages long - in fact I'm pretty sure it's just one piece of paper written on both sides.  And yet it's still SO hard to choose.  The first time we went each of us got something slightly different.  Both my eating companions got some version of a meal that included both Chicken and Waffles.  I bucked the trend and got their Salmon Croquettes with Cheese Eggs, Grits and Waffles.  I could talk for days about how amazing their food is.  Best Eggs I'd ever had.  I am not a big egg person and I was craving these eggs again for a month.  The more I think about them the more I want to go.  The Salmon was amazing - I took one home and it was big enough I made myself a sandwich with it the next day.  The sides are all absolutely amazing.  The Greens have an amazing sweetness aftertaste that I am completely unable to describe.  The Chicken.  Oh, the Chicken.  Let's start w/ this.  I've always thought fried chicken was \"ok\".  I went with 2 folks who love fried chicken - and make their own family handed down recipes.  After their first bites it looked like they had found the holy grail.  It was the best fried chicken I'd ever eaten.  Guess what I've saved for last?  The waffles.  I always eat waffles or pancakes last for 2 reasons 1) They are SO sweet just like a desert and 2) I can only eat a few bites worth.  They are usually too sweet, too sticky, and very quickly mushy.  So, I spread around the butter (removing most of it of course) and drizzled it with some syrup.  It was the lightest, yummiest, buttery heavenly thing I'd ever had.  These were not just waffles.  These were Waffles.  I ate almost the whole thing.  As for Lo-Lo's desert menu - I've heard great things about their Red Velvet cake - but I've never quite been able to get that far into my meal and still order more.  Maybe next time.\n\nService: We've always had great service.  Servers are usually young and have that \"I'm working at my uncle's restaurant for the summer\" quality - but they are fast, knowledgeable and quick on the refills. \n\nAtmosphere: If you are from certain parts of the valley - Lo-Lo's may be a bit of a culture shock.  Yes, it is quite possible if you are of the Caucasian persuasion - you may be the only one there during your entire meal.  I've heard some folks say they would be \"afraid\" to go because of that.  My thought?  Get the heck over it.  Should a black person be afraid to go to AZ 88 or Flemings because they might be the only black person there?  Heck no.  And wouldn't you think they were silly for even thinking it?  Exactly.\n\nOverall: Prices are good.  I honestly can't remember how much anything costs.  I blame the food.  But I do remember thinking \"wow, is that all?\" every time we go.  Location is downtown - just minutes from AWA.  Food is out of this freaking world.

We were seated immediately (I have no idea what people were talking about regarding the wait- we were lucky is all I can wager) in the same room Kristin C. was: the only four person table besides a two person one, where they have the soda machine, extra canola oil, cash register and silver ware and the kitchen where the amiable cooks sauntered out drinking sweet tea and eating the food. I liked the little hutch over our table with various black studies books. I liked the famous signatures tagged all over the place. \n\nI looked over the two-paged laminated menus-and was stumped. I forgot they had fish tooo....and sides...and omg. I guess the staff is used to a long decision making process, cause they hooked us up on the mason jars of sweet tea (holy shit is it GOOOooooOOOD). We all decided on the platter since it affords you two sides WITH cornbread, and the platter rings in only at $12.50 for battered chicken (3 pieces) or Codfish or Catfish with two sides and cornbread...whhaaaa-considering most sides are at like 3.50...I got the cod (go MA pride!), waffle, collard greens, cornbread. Tim got the chicken, waffle, home fries and his dad got catfish, waffle and homefries. After placing the order (I was gonna get fried okra but since the greens aren't cooked with ham, I went for 'em), it came within ten minutes-like FAST.\n\nWe all dove right into the waffle (I scooped off the butter immediately on to a separate dish in hopes of saving myself a little) and all agreed it was the best waffle ever.\n\n\"This waffle is good.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is\"\n\n\"Oh my...I just had the waffle and it is GOOD.\"\n\nfive minutes later\n\n\"This waffle is really, really good.\"\n\nten minutes later\n\n\"I can't believe how perfect this waffle is\"\n\nIt was like fucking Groundhog Day with this waffle, I couldn't picture a better waffle-not too doughy, not too nutmegy, not too crispy, not too buttermilky, not too cinammonly, not too eggy, not too airy, the little waffle indents weren't too deep or shallow for optimal warmed maple syrup lovin', and I ate the whole damn waffle. My lil' waffle of doom.\n\nI could only manage to eat one piece of Cod (it was as big as my face) and the crunchy, flavourful (but oddly not spicy) batter was perfect with the hot sauce on the table. The cornbread a moist muffin of pure delish-a real compliment, not a star, but a perfect compliment to the rest of the palate. I loved my collared greens and it was spicy, and vaguely sweet, and I ate it gingerly it was that good. In fact even thought I stuffed myself, I still had a whole piece of cod, a 3/4 of a cornbread muffin, and almost huge bowl of collard greens left over.\n\nWe really wanted that red velvet cake so seductive under the glass dome case on the counter, but as we sat there drinking our refills, the pain started and the dreaminess and sleepiness and regret. \n\nOur guest loved it, kept complimenting me on it (and didn't notice my bizarre eating habits), Tim mentioned if he lived near by he would gain 5,000 pounds, and I can't wait to come back on a weekday early afternoon to have brunch w/the waffle and GRITS...yummers!!!!!!", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 13, "useful": 11, "cool": 11}}, {"text": "Every once in a while, you just need to enjoy good southern cooking.\n\nI was taken to Lo-lo's while visiting Phoenix.\n\nThe Sweet Tea is served in a mason jar and comes with a diabetic attack.

We were the 5th group in line and by the time the doors opened there was a pretty good sized line. As soon as we sat down I got up to use the bathroom (morning coffee works fast!) and noticed that EVERY table was full. I mean every table (this is approximately 45 seconds after opening the doors). \n\nNow, I worked in the restaurant business for over 5 years and that would have been a NIGHTMARE at any of the places I worked at. I was intrigued to see how they would handle it. \n\nThey used a \"shotgun\" approach to serving, we saw at least half a dozen servers throughout our entire meal asking and getting us what we needed. The service was not notably friendly, but it was fast and efficient and there was almost always a server within earshot if we needed something. I have no complaints here, but I am relatively easy to please on the service side (probably the 5 years doing it myself ;)\nAnyway, on to the food, we all tried to order so that we could try all the \"famous\" items. So I ended up having some of each of the following: Chicken, Waffles, Grits, Cheese Eggs, and Fried Okra.\nI am going start at the best and move down. One caveat before we begin, I am not at all a fried chicken fan, I eat it on occasion but have never been excited about it or sought it out. \n\n1.) The Chicken: It was absofreakinlutely amazing. I am talking breathtakingly good. I'm talking take a bite and then hold it out in front of you to look at it to make sure it is just a piece of fried chicken in your hand. It was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside and not at all greasy. I don't know what they put in the batter but it was awesome. I am starting to salivate right now actually. I did try it true southern style with syrup on it, which was good, but I stopped because I felt the syrup was detracting from the overall flavor. I am not going to attempt to describe the taste, you are just going to have to go and try it for yourself; I will never do it justice. By FAR the best fried chicken I have ever eaten. All of this impression was with going in there with REALLY high expectations, if that tells you something.\n\n2.) The Waffles: Like I just mentioned, I went to Lo Lo's with really high expectations because of friends and Yelp reviews. I was not disappointed here either. They were very, very tasty, and even slightly exceeded my expectations. They are the best waffles I have ever had, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, smothered in butter and syrup YUM. I cleared my plate despite the physical pain of eating so much. I would go back here just for the waffles, but I have to admit, the margin by which the chicken exceeded my expectations was much larger.\n\n3.) The Grits: They were very good; I probably won't get them next time, not because they were lacking but because they would take up valuable chicken and waffle space in my stomach. My only previous experience with grits was in the Army, and obviously, this was an entirely different species of grits.\n\n4.) The Cheese Eggs: These were tasty, fluffy and cheesy, overall exceptional eggs. Mine got a little syrup and butter on them which actually were really good. I can't decide if I would forfeit more bits of chicken and waffles for them though =P\n\n5.) The Fried Okra: Also very good, and a great appetizer. We had a native Texan with us who is a rabid okra fan and she said they were the best fried okra she had ever had. For me though, they will likely go the way of the grits next time.\n\nFor drinks we all got tea, mine was the only unsweet one (which was really good). The sweet tea fans in the group said it was the best sweat tea they have had in Arizona.\n\nOverall we got our food fast, our drinks stayed full and the food was phenomenal and even better than were expecting (and we were expecting greatness). I will now be a regular customer and am going to start browbeating my friends that haven't tried it yet to go with me ;)\n\nLo Lo, I sincerely hope this restaurant has made you a wealthy man because it would be a crime if it hasn't.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 6, "cool": 7}}, {"text": "My roommate & I went to Lo-Lo's on a random late Saturday morning.. and never wanted to leave.

From a culinary point of view, chefs continually strive for balance. With Lo-Lo's you get balance between savory fried chicken and sweet waffles. It's like joy on a plate! \n\nFor those in the know about Phoenix soul food, there is a fair bit of confusion about the link between Lo-Lo's and Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe. For the record, Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles is owned by Larry \"Lo-Lo\" White, the grandson of Mrs. White, the owner of Phoenix landmark Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe. \n\nLo-Lo's is the best value-for-your-dollar restaurant in Phoenix. You can eat like a Soul Food King for $15 including your beverage (try half sweet tea and half regular iced tea to fend off the diabetic coma) and tip. \n\nI usually order the Betty Boop, which includes a fried chicken breast and a waffle. I make it real Betty Boop by adding a second breast. I'm always tempted by Aunt Hattie's Salmon Croquettes, but I invariably go for chicken and waffles instead because they are SO good! \n\nThe fried chicken at Lo-Lo's is utterly delicious. Some reviewers have noted that it can take a while to get your food at Lo-Lo's. I challenge those detractors to fry chicken from scratch at home. Fried chicken is simply something that cannot be rushed. I fry my own chicken and it takes 18-20 minutes to fry a skillet of chicken. If you try to rush it, you burn the coating and skin and the meat does not cook through. Baring this in mind, I never complain if it takes a while to get my food at Lo-Lo's. Yes, there can be a bit of a wait when they're really busy, but I cannot express how happy I am not to be the poor soul slaving over a stove filled with skillets of frying chicken. Apparently some customers have tried to stop by Lo-Lo's in a rush to catch a flight at nearby Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport as they've posted a sign that reads:  \"If you have a plane to catch, then maybe Lo-Lo's just might not be the place for you...PLEASE try us again when you have mo' time!  THX.\"\n\nBesides the chicken, the waffles are delicious as they're loaded with vanilla and they're crispy and brown on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. The warmed syrup adds that final touch of sugary goodness. You'll also see an eye-popping \"dollop\" of butter served with each waffle. This isn't a restaurant for the calorie-conscious, so spread the butter over your waffle, pour on the syrup, and dive in, honey!\n\nThe side dishes at Lo-Lo's are worthy of attention on their own. The Collard Greens are sublime and they're my favorite. They're always perfectly cooked and spicy. Lo-Lo claims all the side dishes are vegetarian and if they are, I tip my hat to him. I'm a bit dubious because the collard greens taste like they're loaded with rendered bacon fat and that makes them oh, so tasty! The BF agrees with me on the question about the vegetarian sides, not that either of us cares. The Mac and Cheese is excellent if you get it when it's fresh and the sauce remains nice and creamy. If you get it after it's been sitting for a while, it becomes a bit too congealed. The Rice and Gravy is tasty because the gravy is the star and it does not disappoint. Fried Okra has been added to the menu and it's great. The BF relishes the Cheese Grits and Lo-Lo does not skimp on the cheese or butter. \n\nFor dessert (or Sanny Sand's in Lo-Lo speak) Red Velvet Cake is a bit of a disappointment. Red Velvet Cake should be remarkably tender and the texture of the version at Lo-Lo's is unfortunately reminiscent of corn bread. The cream cheese frosting is good, but not good enough to offset the overly coarse texture of the cake. After everything else, dessert is pretty much superfluous at Lo-Lo's anyway. Enjoy a waffle as your dessert if you must indulge in a final course.\n\nThis place is a true hole in the wall. If it seems small now with a grand total of 49 seats, imagine how tiny it was before they added the \"west wing\" as the six tables with 24 seats in the elongated room to the west didn't exist in the original footprint. However, this place has its own brand of ambiance and charm. Lo-Lo's walls in the room with the counter are lined with autographs of famous guests including Amare Stoudemire, Charles Barkley, Curly Neal, former Governor Rose Mofford, Larry Fitzgerald, Too Short, Ken Griffey, and WWII Tuskegee Airmen heroes.\n\nI like to go for what I call \"Gospel Brunch.\" On Sunday mornings you'll get the added treat of watching folks in their Sunday best after church. You'll see some awesome outfits and some super-stylish hats.

The place was packed.\n\nTwo ordered a water and lemonade and the third went for the sweet tea.  It was SO sweet and SO good.  The jar they brought it in seemed enough for the whole table, but somehow she managed to take it down without a problem.\n\nShe ordered Tre-Tre's (2 chicken legs and a waffle) and a side of Mac n' Cheese.  They also split two cornbread muffins between the three of them.  They took a late lunch and waited a little while for their order so by the time it arrived, they were ravenously hungry and dug right in to the grub.  They didn't talk to each other for five minutes except to comment on the food and ask one another if they had tried it all yet.  The chicken was juicy and crunchy.

The cornbread was fluffy and delicious.\n\nAfter the initial feeding frenzy took place, they began to slow down.  It began getting hotter and hotter, but they kept eating, drinking, and sweating.

We had been back-and-forth yelping, and Lo-Lo's was something we knew we definitely had to try.... but we had no idea how to get there from ASU in Tempe. After trying for half an hour to use the Valley Metro Trip Planner (which gets a NEGATIVE 4 stars for being completely unintuitive and impossible!), we called Lo-Lo's and were immediately giving light rail and bus directions. \n\nAfter probably an hour and a half, during which we are getting hungrier and hungrier, and all our conversation is redirecting to fried chicken, we walk in the door and are immediately welcomed and told to sit whereever we like. We grab a table, and are offered drinks. I got a re-fillable jar of some of the best sweet tea I've ever had (although walking three blocks in 100 degree weather may have biased that opinion sometime), and we also got two ice waters to rehydrate. We looked at the menu and immediately knew what we wanted. I ordered the soul food platter, 3 pieces of fried chicken, cornbread, and sides of mac n'cheese and collard greens. Daniel ordered the Lil' Amadi, which was 1 leg and 1 thigh with a waffle, and a side of red beans (no rice). \n\nOkay. So. I don't like waffles. I'm used the Belgian waffles, which are way too huge and fill me up with bread taste and make me feel bloated. Lo-Lo's waffle blew me away; it literally was like buttery, slightly mealy, air. I kept stealing bites until I basically ate the whole thing, drenched in maple syrup and fluffy whipped butter. The red beans and collard greens were incredible! We both agreed that they were our favorites of the whole meal (two former vegans... haha): the beans had a touch of sweetness, simultaneously savory and tender. The collards had basically no bitterness at all, but weren't super salty. They were tender and cut into small slices that perfectly combined into a side-appropritate mouthfull. The mac n'cheese was pretty good but I didn't really focus on its taste. The chicken! Oh my god. I've never had breast meat that was still juicy. Incredible texture, the tenderness of the meat and the crispness of the skin juxtaposed. This place definitely blows Roscoe's out, and as a native LA-er, I'm sorry to say it. \n\nThe price is really great, less than 30 altogether, and we left a large tip because the service was so great! We felt so welcomed by the staff, and we could tell that they were having a chill time as well, singing along to Justin Timberlake in the next room. The only downside (not on their end) was that because of my slight cold, I couldn't taste all the flavors as well as I could have otherwise; that's the only reason this isn't getting a 5, and I can see myself changing that... I also cursed myself for forgetting my camera. I guess that means that I'll have to make another trip out there before I'm out of this desert.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I've been waiting forever to try chicken and waffles and I'm so glad Lo-Lo's was the spot to pop my chicken and waffles cherry. \n\nIt's a humble restaurant in the middle of nowhere, which, had it not been for the huge text sprawled on the side of a building, we would have never noticed the tiny entrance. \n\nI came here with my girlfriend while visiting her at institute and this was one of the highest reviewed restaurants in the area so we thought it would be a good idea to give it a try. \n\nThe staff is extremely welcoming and helpful. They took the time to help us find a way to the restaurant using public transportation(we were coming from ASU so we had to use both the light rail and bus system) when the trip planner had failed us miserably and would otherwise have left us stranded in 100 degree weather. \n\nThe space is very cozy and the table and chairs are very much something laypeople could own(wood - painted, none of that hyper-modern furniture here). It's not a super big restaurant so I imagine they could get packed very easily during peak business hours. \n\nThe food here is absolutely amazing. I got to try a few dishes:\n\n1. Lil' Amadi(waffle plus leg and thigh of chicken) - This is the best fried chicken I've ever had. The skin was not soggy at all and had a very nice crisp/crunch to eat. The skin was not rubbery at all and gave away easily with a little resistance(which is nice, because super flaky skin is never good and a teeny bit of resistance keeps the skin together on the chicken). The skin to meat ratio was also good - in other words, I didn't feel like I was either eating nothing but skin or that they were being skimpy with the skin. The meat was extremely juicy and my girlfriend let me try some of her white meat and it is one of the few times(other than in Pho) that I've had white meat that is juicy. The waffle was also one of the best waffles I've ever had and I usually hate waffles. The waffle here was on the thinner side and had great texture. It was slightly crispy on the outside while maintaining a very moist inside - great texture combination. Also, the waffle wasn't soggy. This is key because I usually hate Belgian waffles because they're too thick, cakey, and tend to get soggy in the middle and are just plain gross. They give you a healthy dose of butter and syrup which made eating the chicken and waffles much more enjoyable.\n\nSoul Food Platter - My girlfriend and I basically ordered two dishes and tried eachother's dishes. The soul food platter allows you to choose between chicken or fish and a choice of two side dishes and corn bread. My girlfriend got chicken(three-ish pieces - sometimes I don't consider the chicken wing a full piece because of the higher bone to meat ratio than other parts of the chicken), collard greens, and mac-n-cheese. The collard greens were delicious! They weren't too salty like some of the other times I've tried them. They were also cooked just right - not too soft due to overcooking but not too hard due to undercooking. The leaves were soft and the stalk gave more solid texture to juxtapose with the leaves(but not saying that the stalk was hard - it wasn't - just more firm than the leaves). The mac-n-cheese was okay. I've definitely had better. To me, it was a slightly more gourmet version of the Kraft's mac-n-cheese. The corn bread was also just okay. It was on the more dry side and I ended up having to dip the corn bread in sauce because my salivary glands were running low on lubricant. \n\nRed Beans - These were delicious! My girlfriend thinks they cooked them with ham to give it a slightly smokey, salty taste and I think I agree. They're not too sweet which I definitely find to be a characteristic of cheap red beans. Lo-Lo's makes an effort to actually make their red beans savory and it's very evident. The sauce goes great with the cornbread as extra lubricant. \n\nIn regards to side dishes I recommend getting the collard greens and red beans. \n\nSweet Tea - My girlfriend says that iced tea is usually lackluster because it's just like drinking tea - except cold and that the defining factor to sweet tea is that it's sweet and refreshing - something cold drinks should be. I agree. The sweet tea here was divine and a perfect beverage to our meal and great to have when the weather outside was 100 degrees. Another big plus is that there were unlimited refills! It's served in a huge jar and we easily went through two of them. Amazing. \n\nOne regret I have is not trying the red velvet cake. \n\nThe food here is decently priced. It came out to roughly $27 for the both of us and we left extremely full and happy. \n\nThe reason why I hesitate giving Lo-Lo's five stars is because I'm not a veteran chicken and waffles eater, but rather, a recently deflowered chicken and waffles novice. Until I've had more chicken and waffles to compare to, I will hold off the five stars and just give four stars for now. \n\nI definitely recommend this place to anyone in town!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I went today for lunch with my husband and really enjoyed everything!!\n\nWhat we had: \n\nfried chicken- this was the best I have ever had..it was juicy and flavorful and the skin crispy and delicious\n\nfired catfish: The Best!! wonderful flavor and perfectly cooked\n\nbeans over rice- tasted just like homemade, it was really good, did need a little salt though\n\nmac-n-cheese- yummy..not the best I have had, but still good\n\ncornbread- absolutely perfect and buttery\n\nsweet tea- this was the best part of the meal and they gave us a to go cup so we could take it with us\n\nSERVICE- very welcoming from the time we opened the door until the time we left...they all seem to work together and we were very well taken care of\n\nThank you Lo Lo's !!!!\n:", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "Yummy chicken and to-die-for waffles with all that buttery goodness.

The restaurant is very cramped if you are claustrophobic don't dine in, this place is smaller than Matt's BB! I mean you gotta go outside to change your mind. I had to take off a star for the cramped quarters. \n\nThen I had to take off another star because it was hotter than hell in there! I was sweating like a sinner in church! Did they even have air? That is not cool literally! I like that they use mason jars to serve the drinks.

We didn't know who our server was. One person came and took a drink order another person delivered it. Then a third person asked if we were ready to order. Then a fourth asked for our order we gave it. Then we had a 5th person who brought the food, and a 6th that we paid the bill with?? What the hell was that about we didn't know who to tip. We also had to sit for what seemed like an eternity on the sun to get our bill paid. For as small as Lo Lo's is they have to many people running around there not a very good use of funds if you ask me. They have about a dozen tables there and I counted 9 people working the floor. That's crazy. \n\nNow on to the food, I order fried chicken, smothered potatoes, and buttered corn. I had to laugh when a girl across the room wanted to order grilled chicken and asked what are the potatoes smothered with. This is southern cooking, soul food. It is smothered in gravy! Duh. I thought the chicken was very good and large pieces too. The smothered potatoes were very good just needed a little salt. The buttered corn was right on point. \n\nMy friend got the catfish and chips. The catfish was good I still prefer Honey Bears Cat!

This seemed like a good place to go....although I had a feeling the place was going to be overrated. \n\nWhile I don't know the Phoenix area well, the restaurant seemed to be located in the industrial boonies - the street looked a bit sketchy, and there was this ghettoish sign painted on a building pointing you to the way of Lo-Lo's.  There was plenty of street parking, and I don't recall seeing a parking lot.  It's a cute looking shop - shaped like a tiny house decorated with some neon lights.  \n\nThe place is small - I recall about 6 or 7 tables and the restaurant had most of the tables occupied on a Friday night.  Definitely not a place for big groups unless you want to take over the entire restaurant.  It's a casual spot - waiter service is casual as well.  You don't have a dedicated waiter - they have 2 or 3 people on staff to help the customers as needed (which makes sense for such a small place).\n\nI'm not quite sure why, but it took us a little while to order - there were a decent amount of items on the menu, but because the menu items were mainly combinations of the same thing, we were confused on what/how to order.  For our party of 3, we ended up ordering (I think):  Baby Ray ($13 or 12), Lo-Lo's ($12 or 11), and Stupid Fries ($8).  This place should really be a $$ rating vs. $ - our total bill including tax ended up to be a bit over $40 including tax & tip.  This was just for 2 entrees and 1 appetizer.\n\nFood came in a reasonable amount of time - probably about 10 to 15 minutes.  Portions were reasonably sized - not too big or small.  We had 5 or 6 pieces of chicken and 4 or 5 waffles to share.  The chicken was OK - I didn't find anything special about it.  Meat was tender and the crust was OK.  It helped adding some hot sauce and vinegar to help enhance the flavor.  Waffles were OK - could have been a bit better if the outside was crispier.  \n\nOverall, this place was OK - it wasn't exactly a place to rave home about.

Apparently a traditional southern recipe but one I'd not previously encountered I was told that these were best with a splash of Lo-Lo's \"famous\" hot sauce and although I generally prefer to avoid condiments I must say my neighbors were right as the acidity of the sauce really helped to bring out some of the more briny notes from the salmon while breading remained crunchy with minimal grease.\n\nMoving next to my main plate, the $14 Soulfood Platter with Chicken Fried Chicken, a golden waffle, macaroni and cheese, plus a round of cornbread it would be hard to find a gripe with this dish save for, maybe, those who like their mac n' cheese a little over-baked and with a bit of crunch.

Nicely spiced and with the gravy further gilding the lily I next turned my attention to the waffle, also crisp but intensely buttery with a good amount of 'give' at the center and while pure maple syrup would have been ideal in the end the Mrs. Butterworth's was fine - the sweetness tempered by the chicken, gravy, and macaroni.  Last but not least, the cornbread crowned with a mound of butter was textbook - a little dry, not too sweet, and good both on its own or as a transition between the plate's other components.\n\nMaking short work of the Soulfood plate my primary server, Joseph, stopped by to say \"nice job\" and asking if I had room for dessert I think he was surprised when I said yes - and even more surprised when I ordered two; one for here, one to go, and both eliciting a slow whistle from the gentleman to my left who said to his wife \"that boy can eat\" - and much like the savories what I ate next would be outstanding.\n\nBeginning first with the lesser known of Lo-Lo's signature desserts, a house made banana puddin' served in a hefty mason jar and topped with an airy dollop of whipped cream - at $5 this is probably the steal of the menu as the container must have contained twenty spoonful of the rich parfait.  At times rife with the fructose of banana and at times mellowed by whipped cream or saturated Nilla wafers with plenty of textural nuance added by crumbles and chunks of unsoaked cookie this was precisely my kind of dessert; high end ingredients or not, I love pudding.\n\nRealizing I couldn't (or a least shouldn't) leave Lo-Lo's without trying their oft raved \"Sandy Sand's Red Velvet Cake\" and knowing I could (but shouldn't) have eaten it while I was still seated at 10 Yuma Street I asked for a piece to be boxed up and although it wasn't pretty, the results were just as good as many have suggested - the cake moist, dense, and loaded with cocoa while the cream cheese icing is slick but not too sweet and nicely tempered by the pecans.  Generally one to fancy cupcakes over sliced cakes mostly because I prefer there to be more cooked surface area and thus more 'sponge' I was particularly interested to see the open baking window as I left the restaurant where the team was assembling the cakes from large springform pans thus allowing the layers to each have more exposure and thus explaining the excellent texture.  For my money I'd go with the puddin', but this is one damned fine Red Velvet, and in the context of the experience that is Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles either make a great finale to a great meal in an unexpected but excellent setting.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 6, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I have fantasized about the idea of chicken and waffles for quite some time now, and Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles was all that I hoped for and more!

We literally waited an HOUR AND A HALF for our food to come to the table, and I believe the only reason why we got it then was because we had complained to the manager.

Nothing. Then our waitress walks by our section at the hour 15 mark we ask her what the hell is going on, we get no real response. FINALLY we are at 1.5 hours and we are ready to walk, our friend goes and finds the manager and asks him whats going on and to please come talk to us. 2 minutes later the manager comes to our table with food! Yesssssss only its wrong, BOO :( They delivered 2 orders of stupid fries to the table, when we told him we only ordered one he said well we are just going to throw this away so keep it, which I am glad we did because it was going to still be a while for all the food to come out correctly. My friends order was the veggie plate, 2 of the 4 sides were wrong, then they tried to deliver the same wrong veggie plate again.

Please come take notes.\n\nThis is a silly thing to be happy about, perhaps, but I am always slightly irritated when I get a 6oz plastic tumbler stuffed with ice and a few drops of water. I drink water, a lot of it, and I don't normally get other drinks. Good service, an extra cup, a pitcher at the table, these are all things that can mitigate this. Lo-Lo's sidesteps it completely by providing 1L mason jars of water (I believe I saw kool-aid too) by default. I didn't even need a refill.\n\nI was so massively over-full that I couldn't try the red velvet cake but I'm almost considering driving back down there and getting a piece to go, the way other yelpers go on about it.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "This is a must try if you are ever in phx!

I have only eaten at the Scottsdale location but my comment is for the Central location.\nMy mom and I went in there this evening after having lunch at the Scottsdale location. We stopped in because the Scottsdale location had run out of banana pudding and i was craving it. I called ahead to make sure the Central location had not run out as well. I told the hostess on the phone that I was heading in to get some \"To Go\". Upon arrival we walked in and advised the hostess that we wished to place a dessert order to go. She promptly replied that they are NOT DOING ANY TO GO ORDERS!! HUH??? I advised the hostess that my mom and I only wanted banana pudding and a slice of red velvet cake, plus had called just 10 minutes prior. Again she reminded me that they had been advised by management that there would be no to go orders because they \"Backed up\" the kitchen and delayed orders. Even for dessert that takes 2 minutes???? It would seem to me that if you do not have enough staff to fully run your business then you should probably look into hiring another cook!!! But I must have mistaken the establishment for a restaurant, silly me! After checking with management the hostess returned and reluctantly took my order. I asked my mom if she wanted the Red Velvet cake or the Soc it to me cake. The hostess interrupted to advise me that they didnt have that there. I reminded her that the sign outside stated that it was one of the specials today!! \nIt took longer for the hostess to take my money and give receipt than it took to get my order packaged to go.\n\nI love Lo-Lo's. My family and I eat at the Scottsdale location 3 times a month. We get the best service there. I have been to the location on Central twice and twice they have failed to provide any service even close to the service in Scottsdale.

The only reason it gets 2 stars is because the waiter was nice and the place looked cool. \n\nFirst impressions are everything, so they say, and in this instance I would agree. Since moving here over a year ago I have heard people go on and on about Lolo's chicken and waffles, especially when they find out I moved from the south. \"Oh it is the best soul food\", \"They have the best fried chicken I have had anywhere..\" are some of the things people have said. We live in Mesa and there is not a location near us but this morning  we were running errands in Phoenix and drove about 15 minutes out of our way so I could finally try this place that so many people have raved about. The place was decorated nice, it was not too long after they opened and it was not busy, we were seated right away. Took about 10 minutes before we saw a server, our drinks were brought out fairly quick and our order taken. Our food came out pretty quick but what difference does quick service make when the food is cold? The skin on the chicken was not even crisp on the edges, they had obviously been sitting around for a while. I tried a bite anyway, good fried chicken is good hot or cold and this was not good. It had the overwhelming taste of flour and I think the cook forgot to put seasoning on it at all. When the waiter came over to check on us I told him the chicken was cold and I didn't want it, at first he took the plate back and didn't say anything at all, when he brought the check he apologized. I have heard people say how good it is and maybe my experience is isolated but if it really was an uncommon experience then why didn't the waiter seemed surprised when I returned it? Why didn't he offer to get me a fresh plate? Why didn't a manager come over to see what they problem was or to apologize? Maybe they are used to serving sub-standard food, that is the only thing I can think of. This place reminds me of a lot of places that were really good until they got popular, quality of food and service goes down, prices go up and the only reason they stay in business is because they are \"cool\" or trendy. \n\nBottom line - Don't think I will try this place again, there are so many really good restaurants to try in the Phoenix area and when you are going to spend an average of $10+  per person to sit down & eat somewhere, the food should at least be fresh. \n\nOh yeah, one more thing, a glass jar of kool-aid should never cost $3, unless you get to take the jar with you.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I don't want to be a snob, but coming from LA we were expecting some great things out of this place.

The staff was attentive, and the food came out quickly.\n\nFinally getting a long awaited chance to experience the legend, I decided to get the signature items they are famous for: chicken and waffles.  I got the two thighs and one waffle combination.  One of the smaller options on their menu, but plenty big to do detectable damage to my waistline.  They have quite a large number of other items and combinations on their menu, so this review can't speak to those.  Only the ones on the sign outside.  I didn't even try their $3 glass of kool-aid (they actually let you know you're paying $3 for kool-aid, which is incredibly cheap to make).  No, I only had water to soften the expected blow of stepping on the scale the next day.\n\nThe chicken was good.  That's all I can really say about it.  Just good.  However, given all the praise heaped on this place, \"good\" left me very disappointed.  I was expecting excellent, outstanding, amazing, unique, clever, inspired, daring, exotic, etc.  No, this was basic fried chicken.  It tasted like fried chicken you might get at a supermarket deli counter, or at an all-you-can-eat buffet trough.  Grab a piece of raw chicken, dip it in egg wash, dip it in flour, and throw it in the fryer.  I couldn't even dectect any spices in the batter.  The least they could do is try to beat KFC, and not just match Hometown Buffet and call it good.\n\nThe waffle on the other hand really was excellent.  It had a suggestion of cinnamon that was noticeable without being dominating.  The generous whipped butter they put on it had its own kind of magic.  The syrup brought it all together just right, and was amazingly served in what turned out to be the perfect quantity.  I very much enjoyed every bite of my waffle.  It's hard to say if they are using mediocre chicken to get you to better appreciate your waffle, or if they are using excellent waffles to push their mediocre chicken.\n\nI had to find a special occasion that brought me to the area, and leave work a little early to have a chance to try Lo Lo's.  I won't put in that effort again.  I might go back, especially if it's with a group, but I will probably stick with the waffle and try other menu items besides the chicken.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "WHERE DO I BEGIN\nfor starters lets just say this place is B.O.M.B\nthe red kool aid ROCKS!!!\nthe chicken is oh so amazing but the best is the waffles and the honey bbq wings/ chinas chicken .

Stood waiting for 45 minutes and noticed people that came after us being seated so went up and looked at the waiting list and they had skipped us and been seating people after us with parties of 3 and 4 at tables with four chairs and left us waiting for one of the couple tables of only 2 chairs since there was only two of us. I got upset at the gal running the waiting list and she said \"you're next\" then proceeded to sit 4 more parties before us before we were finally seated at a table with 4 chairs since a table for 2 never opened up.\n\nThat was strike one.\n\nNext, with the name \"Chicken and Waffles\" I expected to have some good waffles and figured they would be BIG. I ordered 3 chicken wings and 1 waffle for $10.50 and was very disappointed when this little thin waffle came out with 3 little tiny chicken wings. I get bigger wings when be buy fried chicken at the deli counter of Fry's grocery stores. I thought about ordering another waffle but seen they wanted $4 for just a tiny waffle and said screw that. I walked away still hungry.\n\nThe chicken had good flavor but the waffle was tiny and soggy and a frozen waffle out of box would have been just as impressive as this waffle.\n\nWe were at the place for nearly 2.5 hours and the bill for two of us was right at $30 for lunch and both of us were still hungry when we left.

I wanted Southern-ghetto-fabulous and damnit,  I got it. And even though we showed up at 1 for brunch, we were still faced with a line literally out the door and almost around the block... yet we still put our name down and waited. The place is quite big so even with a large wait list our wait was still only 20mins- not too terrible. As we waited outside and got closer to the entrance, we kept admiring the people that came out with their to-go box, holding their stomachs and making jokes about being so full that they'll roll down the hill. \"Thats what I want to be like!\" I cried, super giddy with excitement. \n\nWe got seated soon enough and we already knew what we wanted (obviously we spent our time outside planning out our meal). Between the two of us we ordered: Chicken and waffles (duh), Fried & smothered pork chops with mac and cheese, green beans and corn bread, fried green tomato appetizer and a giant mason jar of purple kool aid.\n\nAs our feast arrived, I could feel my heart beating faster and my arteries clogging up. This was going to be a challenge worth fighting for. We started with the C&W and each put a half-waffle and half-chicken on our plate. My friend starts eating the chicken and I immediately go in a panic. \"What are you doing! No! That's not how you eat it!\". After giving him a long and passionate sermon, I bring a random server to our table to reinforce my lecture about the correct way of eating C+W. The server agrees:\n\n************You grab your waffle. Add a layer of honey/syrup on top of every square of your waffle. You place your chicken ON TOP (either cut-up or whole). You cover the chicken with hot sauce. You grab your knife and fork (OR fold the waffle like a taco) and YOU EAT A BITE OF EVERYTHING AT ONCE************ \n\nAs he took his first bite I swear I saw unicorns and rainbows come out of his eyes. He finally got it. The sweet, salty, spicy, crunchy, soft, fried goodness that is a well-executed C+W. Its sweaty redneck sex on a plate. Its fucking good.\n\nAfter that, you could've given us a flaccid french fry and we would have still called it a successful meal. The cornbread was amazing, the mac and cheese was tasty and the pork chop was the size of an overweight chihuahua. The only thing not worth ordering was the damn fried green tomatoes: only 4 slices for $7, completely covered in salt, with a side of salt and some extra salt to go with it. Half-way through the meal we found ourselves surrounded by 3 servers and the chef, all gathered to answer the \"what are gizzards made of?\" question- all because they were afraid that we would be grossed out by the definition. We were all cracking jokes and enjoying their company.\n\nAs we were down to 1 fried green tomato and half a porkchop left, we started breathing heavily. \"I don't think I can eat any more\" said one person. \"WE MUST FINISH THIS\" said, well, me. Using every bone in my body to be able to eat the last couple bites, we took the nasty green tomatoes in a box and called the whole thing a victory. As soon as we sat in my car and turned the car on I grabbed my stomach and said \"I'm sorry, I need to do this\"- *takes off belt. \"OOOHHHH GOD. MUCHH BETTER\".

I was so full, but had to try the red velvet, and so glad I did. The cake is so moist and the frosting is perfect; not overly sweet.

We asked for some help since it was our first time and he did a fine job letting us know what was popular and pointed us to certain things I asked about. I asked him to go ahead and get our drinks while we decide what we wanted to get.\n\nHe came back and asked if we were ready and we said that we were. We placed our order (Number 3, which is 3 pc chicken with two waffles, and a chicken strip basket with fries and a side of corn bread) and then he asked \"So what did you guys want to drink, again?\" Wait a minute. I thought we had already given him our drink order and instead of coming with them, he came and asked what we wanted. That was a tad annoying. \n\nOur order was brought out by a lady who didn't really acknowledge us. Basically \"who had this or that\" and placed them in the center of the table anyway. She just left without saying a word or asking if we would like anything else. Right away, we noticed we had gotten everything except for our corn bread. We waited for our waiter to make his rounds but he didn't come back. It took awhile but he came to seat someone else so the couple seated at the table next to us got his attention and said that they were missing a few items from their order. So we weren't the only ones. \n\nAfter a few trips back and forth to them because he kept forgetting things they were asking for, I got his attention and said that we were missing corn bread. He said he would bring them out. I saw him a few times after that helping other customers and that's fine but he came back to our table and asked how we were doing...without our corn bread. I had to remind him again that we needed corn bread. We were almost done with our meal by this time.\n\nAfter he finally brought it to us, he started coming around a little more. At that point, I wasn't sure whether or not if it had slowed down or not. I figured it did since he was coming around some more. It was kind of too late, anyway.\n\nWhen it came time to bring us our bill, he had to ask us what we had ordered today. I was surprised... He said they had misplaced our order.

But since I did eat it (cause I was hungry mind you) and possibly a little too understanding, I gave him my entire order again.\n\nSo we paid and started leaving and I saw that it was as packed as ever. Worse than when we had arrived. I didn't understand why he would have time to keep checking on us at the end of the meal as opposed to during the meal. Now, I do understand that he may have been new or may even have been too slammed but shouldn't waiters and any establishment at the very least come by and ask if you were doing okay? IDK but the service wasn't on par with some other little restaurants I've been to. \n\nAs for the food, to me it really wasn't anything special.

Being that the rest of the party live further, it would take them a while, so she informed us she can't seat half of our party until the full 8 showed up. Ugh yeah, right. I'm hungry and I'm not waiting so we just asked to be seated for our four. So after letting her know it would just be us for, she writes my name and instructs me to \"scoot\"  to the side and sit down. In slow motion, I turn around and all of the waiting benches are taken soooo where the hell am I suppose to sit, on the older ladies lap that was already sitting there?! She could have easily said \"it will just be a few moments, if you'd like you can take a seat that's available behind you\". Was that too difficult?! So I say whatever, they sat us within the next two minutes.\n\nOur waiter/manager of the restaurant takes our drink orders and he seemed pretty cool cuz he was joking a lil with us.  So my cousin asks if she can put in an order for someone who was showing up a little later and then that's when things went down hill.  We were informed we couldn't do that because it would be cold by the time he came and blah blah blah.  Brotha, that's another order which results into money into your business' pocket.  So we order our food but he let's us order for our cousin who would show up late.  So we place the order and literally 5 minutes later, a different server comes out and says \"UM this is for someone showing up late or somethin\".  Ok, so you mean to tell me there was a discussion about this tiny little request in your kitchen amongst several servers.  Not to mention our order hadn't even come out yet, so the \"complicated\" order was first to come out when our orders were the smallest.  My friend asks why my cousins order came out so fast and why we haven't received ours, so that's when the title of this review comes in \"ma'am we cook chicken and waffles all day, some orders will be quicker than others\". Huh?! I know I didn't major in computer science but this really wasn't THAT complex.

We finally tried this place out after hearing about it from several of our friends and coworkers who have lived in the area for quite some time. We read a few reviews, liked what we saw, and made it a point to go. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and shown to our table. The decor is sort of a modern meets rustic look.  \n\nOur waitress Leslie came right over and took our drink order.  The menu is huge, and we wanted to try everything on it. Needless to say it took us a few minutes to make our decisions, but then we were ready to bring on the hurt. We knew then that this was simultaneously going to be both the best and worst decision ever for dinner. My wife ordered the Lo Lo's chicken and waffles, I ordered the 8 double D's chicken breast and waffle, and we got an order of fries and corn bread to share. We also ordered two drinks off of their specialty menu, a Keep it Simple for my wife, and the tropical drink for me. Sadly, I can't remember the name of the drink. \n\nThe fries and the corn bread came out first.  The corn bread was good, but not the best I've had. The fries are hand cut with a glorious seasoning.  Anyone who knows me well knows my unhealthy obsession with french fries...It's rivaled only by my love of tacos. The fries never stood a chance. Every now and then I would pause for half a second to dip one in ketchup, but they were so good they really didn't need it. Shortly thereafter the rest of the food came out.\n\nThe main course came out on large dishes that were roughly the size of trampolines. My inner fat kid was practically leaping up and down at this point. The amount of food piled on the plates bordered on unnatural. It was about this time that my wife and I realized we may have ordered too much food. We didn't care. We were too busy staring down our plates like two gunslingers before a high noon showdown and furiously snapping photos for our future Yelp post. Our stomachs grumbled with anticipation.\n\nThe chicken was delicious, juicy, and breaded and fried southern style. The waffles were soft and made to order with their special batter. I went all out, ripping my chicken breast off the bone and stuffed it in the waffle, loaded it with butter, syrup, and hot sauce. With a big grin on my face, I folded it up like a giant delicious taco and ate it like it was my last meal on earth. My inner fat kid was getting worried at this point, because he knew there was more to come. Syrup and butter streaming down my hands, I enjoyed it to the last crumb. The waffle split and threatened to spill its contents all over the table several times, but I'm no amateur taco eater. The hot sauce is medium, with a little bit of a kick but not too much, and a nice spicy offset to the sweetness of the syrup.  \n\nThroughout the course of our meal, our table was visited several times by our waitress and other staff members. They kept the drinks filled and cleared away finished plates. Everyone was friendly and made for a great service experience.\n\nTo finish it off, we ordered the banana pudding for dessert. No true Southerner can pass up banana pudding when given the choice. I grew up on my grandma's banana pudding, so there was a high bar of expectations set. I was not disappointed. The style was different from that of my grandmothers, but it was still very good. They use crumbled vanilla wafers as both a base and a topping. As with the drinks, it comes out served in a large mason jar. Be warned, it's a big serving, so come hungry or be ready to share.  My wife threw in the towel about a quarter of the way through. Rookie.  I tore through it like a Serengeti Lion devouring its prey.\n\nMy hunger sated and my inner fat kid crying for mercy, I lay down my fork and napkin in victory.

Not bad, not bad at all. \n\nThe waffles were good, but I was slightly disappointed. I think mine were a little too soft. I like them just a tad bit more crunchy on the outside but still soft. Kinda hard to explain, but they were not bad at all. They too came with a big gob of butter. I swear, I wonder how much butter do they go through each day let alone each week and year! \n\nI ended up only eating part of my grits, all of my eggs, one piece of chicken and half of a waffle. All the rest came home with me for a snack later. \n\nThe ambiance of the place is nice, but I do wish the little flat screen TV that they have in the upper left corner was bigger and more centered. It seems so lost in that wide open space that they have. I also wish they had at least two stalls in the bathroom as there was about a 10 min wait for the ladies room. Other than that, not all bad.

So I checked it out with my omnivorous girlfriend (who ordered wings and fries).  I opted for a side of collard greens and candied yams.  We also had a side of mac n' cheese for her daughter.  I ordered a Kool Aid as well, which cost as much as 25 packets of Kool Aid in the store.  Way, way too much sugar.  Seriously, it tasted like a five-year old got his hands on the sugar jar when mixing it.  The collard greens were pretty tasty and the yams were decent too.  However, neither one of them blew me away by any means.  (I recognize that the chicken is the draw here, but still.)  My girlfried said the wings were good, but I've have seen her much more enthused about wings at other places.  The fries were pretty damn bad.

Delicious it was.  My waitress was attentively awaiting my order, but in no way pushy.  She was busy at the time I closed my menu, but someone else was right there and asked me if they could start something cooking for me.  By all means they could.  She came back...told her someone had already started it and what I ordered.  Food came out and all was well.\n\n*Food:  Good, plenty, and quality.  I had a pretty good plate of food in front of me for $8 (of course, not counting drink or tip).  Chicken seasoning/batter was quite tasty.  My only nit here is that the chicken was a little dry.  It did fall off the bone...but was just a little dry.  The sweet tea and excess syrup on the plate were excellent for addressing this issue though.  Plus, some chicken and waffle bites together was actually not bad.  The waffle itself was quite fluffy and quality made.  My only nitpick with the waffle is aside from the butter provided, the waffle itself had a very buttery flavor to it.  There was nothing wrong with it...just wasn't quite expecting it...and it didn't seem that the syrup was very sweet...so it just tasted very buttery (if I'd realized that, I probably would not have used the whole dollop of butter that was there).

I think it IS better than Roscoe's. I live for their Red Velvet Cake. I DO love most of their food and usually the service is great... so why the two stars? Because I'm not a fan of THIS location. and here's why...\n\n- The crazy hours. I never know WHEN this place is open, sometimes the sun isn't even set and it's closed and other times I go by and late at night and they're open. It's very inconsistant and frustrating. \n- The loud azz sound system blaring in the background makes it hard for me to hear the person I'm dining with. So usually we just eat in silence while the music plays on.\n- The food simply isn't as good as the original location. Everything is a subpar immitation. The chicken is usually overcooked and the waffles lack that certain crunch or crispiness. \n- and my own personal reason - I had hit up Lolos on twitter and said they should have a separate to-go menu and I even said on twitter that we were dining at the counter and it was way facinating to watch the food come from the window. Which it was. I liked it, they were cranking it out and were having a good time when in comes this manager who started barking out orders and basically bullying the staff. I thought it was unfair. and then I got the bill... and was misbilled. I told the waitress who didn't do anything about it and ran my card. I asked her to fix it before running my card - she didn't. I didn't sign my ticket and asked the bully of a manager (who was bald with a tan shirt on June 10th) and then shrugged off my complaint and didn't change it. He didn't even look at it. I was astounded. I didn't know what to do - so I entered my tip and signed my ticket and vowed to never return to the Scottsdale location. oh and before we left, the Bully of a Manager asked me if I wanted a to-go menu, I said yes, thinking it was so serendipidous but when he handed me a regular menu with this shitty look and scarcastic tone he said that THIS WAS their to-go menu... and that's when I knew... he had read my tweets. \n\nI didn't mean any disrespect, honestly. It WOULD be awesome if they had a to-go or catering menu. There will be feedback from customers. And I don't care HOW good your food is, nothing warrents such rudeness to a PAYING customer. I think success had gone to the manager's head and they forgot how to keep it real - one of the drawbacks of being \"Hood-rich\" as the waitstaff's t-shirts declare. \n\nTo my yelpers I say: Be careful of what you tweet. The manager at the Lolo's Scottsdale location is sensitive so perhaps you should just save your opinion for yelp. And as for the food... imagine you found Lolo's recipe book... and you tried to make yourself a little feast, you did everything EXACTLY as it says, but it misses something... some pizazz, some flavor, some... soul?

It wasn't a bad meal but I don't think I'd ever order this again. It didn't taste bad... not at all, but I guess it just felt like I was paying for something my mom could've made me lol. The only reason to pay for this meal is because you don't have access to cooking it yourself. The Okra was just okay. I like Church's okra better. My mom has made better chicken but I'd take their waffles. This meal reminded me of going to Sprinkles for cupcakes.

Granted, the food came out of the kitchen hot and a manager apologized for another table that came in after us for being served first (apparently our order took an extra 15 minutes because of the fish, which takes longer).  Still, there was nothing that I ate there that was worth waiting an hour.  Astoundingly, when we walked out, the restaurant filled and people were waiting for tables, leading me to believe that they'd have to wait no less than two hours for their food.  Not worth it - I could fry my own chicken (and it'd be damn good) in less time.\n\n2) Speaking of the chicken, it's solid.  Don't be fooled - it's superior to KFC, especially with a smattering of extra salt and hot sauce (it's a little underseasoned for my liking, but I err on the side of salt - plus, there's salt on the table, so I can't dock stars for it).  That all being said, if you've been waiting for over an hour to eat, it's hard to be wowed.  Maybe they were understaffed on the fryers or something?  Fish on the other hand, both the redfish (cod) and catfish were so friggin' good.  Perfect cornmeal batter and delectable tartar sauce on the side, they made the wait almost bearable.\n\n3) Servers are extremely laid back, though most are exceptionally cool.  There was one waitress who, when you said please and thank you, said absolutely nothing.  Inexcusably rude, whether you are in a restaurant or not.  It's just basic manners.  Still, just about everyone else working there that we interacted with was very friendly and we even managed a few laughs.\n\n4) Sides are mixed - mac and cheese was mediocre and a little bland, greens were zippy with pepper and vinegar, cheesy grits were creamy and light, red beans and rice had excellent flavor but needed salt, cornbread was moist and buttery and fried okra was crisp and not a bit slimy.  Try the Stupid Fries - an addictive mix of bell peppers, onions, cheese, shredded chicken and gravy, all atop a mess of crisp fries.  The gravy makes the whole dish, perfectly seasoned and addictive in flavor.\n\nAll in all, Lolo's is neither a hit or a miss.  In a city that is pretty sparse on soul food, this place stands out due to the lack of competition.  But there are some glaring points that should still be addressed before I could even fathom giving out 5 stars for this place.  And all this coming from a southern-fried girl who is ready (and I mean ready) to tuck into a real plate of soul food the way it's supposed to be.

The waffle hunt continues. KFC my A$$$$. I have been here twice and the service has been great and the staff very friendly.

(Dummy) So the lady behind the counter insisted on giving them a waffle to try and the Yelp 5 stars were unanimous with the kids so she was ok with the next dinner out would be Lo Lo's. \nAnyway that was a departure from the usual review. I got the 2 thighs and waffle for $7. The Fried chicken is about about the best basic fried chicken I know of. Yes places like KFC have spices, etc, but this is straight forward plain, fried chicken and it doesn't need any thing else to make it top of the line. Krispy fried skin, moist flavorful meat. I can do with out the herbs and spices+the greasiness of some places. \nThe waffle, again about the best basic non-Belgin waffle. \nThe natural comparison is going to come up with Roscoe's in LA. Well if you remove any stigma/aura around the food, it would be hard to say one is better. The only difference I can tell you is that Roscoe's waffles have a slight malt flavor that Lolo's doesn't.

Scottsdale Road\nScottsdale\nVisa, MasterCard\n\nWhile there isn't much in soul food in the Phoenix area, people have always flocked to Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe in the downtown area. Her grandson opened the original LoLo's also in the downtown area, and this summer, thankfully opened a LoLo's in Scottsdale for all the east siders to enjoy.\n\nLoLo's menu is a bit different in that they serve waffles with their chicken as well as a number of breakfast favorites. To begin, companion pronounced the waffles light, fluffy, and with good texture. Waffles are served with a cruette of maple syrup which should be enough for the average person, but if you like, they will gladly bring you enough to drown your waffle(s) in.\n\nTheir chicken is the epitome of fried chicken. It is so different from the fried chicken chains that it is like night and day. Perfectly battered, seasoned and cooked, it can't be beat. It has just enough batter to give it a nice coating without being gobbed on like wallpaper paste. As for flavor - the only thing that comes to mind is wow! It's chicken! Not bunches of herbs and spices, but real, honest to goodness chicken flavor like it was meant to be.\n\nI ordered the Soulfood Platter ($13.00), which came with 3 pieces of chicken and 2 sides. My sides were collard greens and red beans and rice. The collard greens had no woodiness to them, and were cooked to perfection. The addition of a little Trappey's hot pepper & vinegar sauce forced me to devour the entire bowl! The red beans and rice were nicely done, and again, the addition of a little red hot sauce really made the day. For those who don't care for hot sauces, they were fine without it also. Their portion also includes a piece of homemade cornbread smothered in butter. Speaking of smothered, I also had a small bowl of gravy on the side to smother my chicken with. It had perfect flavor and just the right amount of spice.\n\nCompanion ordered the LoLo's ($11.00) which consisted of 3 perfectly cooked pieces of fried chicken served on top of 2 perfect waffles. Companion also ordered a side of Cheese Grits ($3.50) which were just o.k., but were far from being bad.\n\nWe also ordered a plate of Backwoods ($12.00) to share, which are chicken gizzards in gravy served over rice and onions. I'm sure I died and went to heaven on this dish. Gizzards are normally small chewy morsels that you can chew for five or 10 minutes before gulping them down. I don't know how they made these, but they were magnificently tender - one or two bites and it was gone! If I came back and was only able to order one dish, this might be the one - then again, it might be the chicken - then again.....\n\nCompanion ordered sweet tea and immediately noticed that it was still a little warm. Unlike most places, they make everything, including the sweet tea, fresh on the premises.\n\nCompanion has eaten at Pity Pat Porch in Atlanta and pronounced the food to be much better at LoLo's.\n\nThis isn't the place to come for ambiance - basically, there is none. It's the place to come for really good food. The restaurant was clean, and the restrooms were clean.\n\nIf this review doesn't make you want to eat here, perhaps the line out the door will.

Our first visit we had to wait about 15 minutes before we were seated which was not bad. Our second visit we were seated right away. \n\nOn our first visit I ordered 2 chicken wings, 1 waffle and lemonade. Hubby had 1 chicken breast, 1 or 2 waffles (can't remember), french fries (he can't resist them) and sweetened iced tea. \n\nOK first off this place serves their drinks in 32 ounce mason jars. The drinks are huge! They even allow free refills on drinks. \n\nThe menu said the lemonade is homemade but was watery. My husband's iced tea was better but I prefer lemon juice in my tea. \n\nThe food finally came out and the chicken was hot and tasty, BUT......the waffle was cold, thin and as one other reviewer described it, wimpy! The flavor of the waffle was good but it was cold. My husband said his was cold too! His french fries were also cold and he sent them back. \n\nObviously the cook on that day was bit off on his timing of everything. \n\nOur first visit the service was just okay. Not good but okay. It was a bit slow. \n\nOn our second visit we both ordered the soul food platter which came with 3 pieces of chicken and 2 sides. \n\nI had collard greens and mac and cheese as my sides and he had collard greens and red beans and rice. \n\nOn the second visit my chicken breast was was over cooked and dry but everything else was pretty good. There were no complaints from my husband who had a very large juicy chicken breast on his plate. \n\nThe soul food platter also came with corn bread that had so much butter on top that it looked as though an ice cream scoop had been used. The waiter was nice enough to bring me another plate so that we could remove some of the butter. \n\nI knew I was not going to be able to eat a whole soul food platter but there is no other combination on the menu that gives you chicken and the sides without having a waffle which I found a little odd. It did take 3 meals for me to finally eat all of this food. \n\nLo-Lo's also has fish, breakfast items ad desserts on the menu. We did not have the opportunity to try them but while were there we saw that other people had ordered them and they looked pretty good too. \n\nLet me not forget there are also various flavors of kool aid on this menu. \n\nAfter speaking with some of the locals about the waffles at this place they told me to always make sure that I tell them that I want the waffle hot! \n\nI thanked them for the tip but I wouldn't have guessed that I needed to specify that I wanted a hot dish to be hot.

I have been there easily once every other month for the last 3 years. I even pick up the chicken for camping trips (cold Lolo's chicken and beer is heavenly). \n\nMy wife and I were at the one in Scottsdale on Sunday (managed to get a babysitter so we could hit brunch there sans-kids). We arrived at 9:20am so I was fully expecting a LONG wait. We actually got seated right away and ordered coffee and water. \n\nThe server came back with the water and told us the coffee was brewing and took our order. After about 15minutes a different server stopped by and said our food wouldn't be too much longer. This was OK since I knew they would be busy and it would take awhile, no problem. I did ask if we could get the coffee we ordered. \n\nHe said the coffee machine was broken and they were trying to fix it. I mentioned it really sucked having it break in the middle of their breakfast rush. He said it had actually broken they day before and that lots of people wanted coffee (crazy right?). At this moment I thought, that's odd, I thought it was brewing... oh well....\n\nWell, not being one to complain, I worked in restaurants for years during college, but also not being one to enjoy waffles without coffee I opted to run across the parking lot and grab a couple coffees from Einstein bagels for the wife and I. \n\nI came back with the coffee and before I got to the door one of the servers popped out and said, \"Sorry, no outside food or drink\". He was very polite, but I said maybe this could be a special circumstance since their coffee machine had been broken since yesterday and we couldn't get any. He said no. I asked if we could just pour it into their mugs, he said no. I asked if we could switch to an outside table, he said no. \n\nI said I would like to speak to a manager and could he please go tell my wife to change our order to go since I couldn't go back inside. He went inside and came back and said the manager said no also. I was in shock. I could NOT believe this was their response. \n\nI went to the car to put the coffees down so I could text my wife and tell her to just leave the order and we would go somewhere else.  Unfortunately by that time she had paid and had the food. \n\nSo, that's it Lolo's, I refuse to give you another dollar. That was unacceptable. And seriously? What kind of place doesn't have a backup plan for coffee on a Sunday morning? You couldn't send someone out to Target to pickup some cheap coffee makers for the morning? Or rent one from a catering company? Or worst case scenario just order a massive batch from Einsteins? \n\nInstead you opt to tell people they don't get coffee and won't and if they get their own somewhere else they have to leave?  \n\nFAIL", "review_stars": 1, "review_votes": {"funny": 4, "useful": 14, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "After a strenuous morning hike we headed to Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles.

The boyfriend and I were craving waffles thanks to Food Network when we decided to have lunch at this well known favorite.  \nI've been to both locations and even though they serve the same food, I think I'm partial to the downtown location, simply because it feels like you're really down in the south. It's in a renovated house and you're sitting at small home dinner tables. The Scottsdale location is nice, but not as authentic. \nToday's experience was definitely not the best we've had.  We were greeted when we walked in and immediately sat. But that's about where the good service stopped for the day. While we looked over the menu, I overheard another table ask where their drinks were. Apparently the kitchen was out of ice, but the server failed to communicate this to the table. Lucky for us, we didn't have to worry about the ice situation, as our server decided just to wait to greet our table or take our order until there was ice. \nWhen our server finally arrived, she did take our order (The Betty Book and fried okra for me) and put in a drink order. After a few minutes, we got our drinks and our food shortly after. Everything came out great, but we were missing the okra. When I asked, the runner said they didn't have it right now. A few minutes later, our server came to apologize. She said she didn't hear the order, which is really no big deal. Then, she informed us that they don't carry it this time of year because it's too humid to fry correctly. While I appreciate their effort to not serve inferior product (which so many places will do anyway) , it seems a little strange that southern states carry fried okra during the summer when they are considerably more humid than Arizona.  It just didn't make much sense to me, as I am from Texas and have eaten perfectly crunchy fried okra during the summer.  \nAll in all, the food was as good as it always is.

For example, despite the restaurant being very busy on a Friday night, the hostess was lovely and polite and seated me very promptly.  The service in general was excellent.  My server (Mike) was efficient, courteous, and attentive and my order was prepared and delivered very quickly.  I would rate the overall service at 5 stars for this genre of restaurant.\n\nI ordered the soul food platter with an extra piece of chicken, collard greens, and beans and rice - it also comes with a generous cornbread muffin.  The greens were pretty good - a little heavy on the salt, but had a great texture and very smooth overall flavor.  The beans and rice, unfortunately, were uninspired - nothing really wrong with them, but it was a flavor that you can easily get in a can - flat, with no appreciable depth or complexity.  I needed to dump a bunch of hot sauce on them just to make them palatable.  The cornbread had a decent flavor - not terribly sweet or too bland - sort of right in the middle - but the texture left a lot to be desired.  Cornbread should be dense and firm, but still moist and delicious.  This cornbread was somewhat dry and granular.  Again - not horrible, but nothing special.\n\nFor me, though, it's all about the chicken.  Unfortunately that's where Lo-Lo's really fell down.  The fried chicken that they served me was a bit soggy (as if it had been sitting in a bin for a while), overcooked (especially noticeable in the dryness of the breast piece) and definitely under-seasoned.  The chicken meat was composed of average sized cuts of mediocre quality, somewhat fatty, bland chicken - very much akin to what you get at any reasonable supermarket deli for $5 for 8 pieces these days.  The breading was oily and not very tasty (again under-seasoned).  Although it broke my heart to do so, I just stripped the skin and breading off of my chicken and left most of it on the plate.  My low-water mark for acceptable fried chicken is KFC.  With all of its flaws, at least it's usually tasty.  What Lo-Lo's served me didn't raise the bar on KFC at all.\n\nThe price is nothing to brag about either.  I went in alone, only had iced tea to drink, no dessert, and my bill came to $22 and change.  That could buy a lot of fried chicken at KFC. :)\n\nIf I were rating the food alone, I'd have to go with 2 stars.  The service brought it up a whole notch, hence the 3 star rating.

I had a 3 piece platter which included a wing, breast, and thigh.  The chicken tasted great with the waffles in maple syrup and butter.  The collard greens were tender, with good smokey flavor and a hint of bitterness from the natural flavor of the greens.

When I first started going, they didn't have the blue koolaid, so I ordered the red koolaid.  On a couple of occasions, I was feeling snazzy, so I ordered the Toy Toy.  The Tre  Tre is similar to the Toy Toy.  Both have 2 pieces of chicken and a waffle.  Tre Tre - Drumsticks.  Toy Toy - Wings.  The chicken is hot and crispy.  I have had it a time or two and thought that perhaps it had been cooked and sitting in a warmer too long.  The waffles are extremely good.  I enjoy putting a little of the butter and a lot of the syrup on mine and eating my waffle from the inside out!  YUMMY!   I haven't had much else on the menu, but I've sampled the plates of folks I've been with and their food was good.  I was in there a couple of weeks ago and I see that they have added several new items to the menu.

I love being waited on by a couple of guys that work there.  they are twins.  Mr C and Mr D (if I recall correctly).  Those are some nice fellas.\n\nI have tried their Red Velvet Cake and I was somewhat surprised to find that it was a decent contender for what I would call a good Red Velvet Cake.  It doesn't rival my 1st and 2nd favorite RVC's in phoenix.  The texture of this cake is exactly moist enough and the cream cheese icing tastes creamy and sweet.  The one thing their RVC is missing is the taste of the cake.  The hint of the chocolate is not there.

I'm from the South, and the combination of chicken and waffles isn't as odd as it might seem to people from other parts of the country.  This is a southern staple, and suprisingly good.  However, it's the collards, fried okra and candied sweets with cornbread that get my attention.  It's hard to find any place here in the Valley that serves collard greens -- or greens of any kind -- much less collard greens done really well.  Add a little tabasco vinegar, and you're ready to rock.  Couple the veggies with a huge hunk of cornbread slathered in butter, and your meal is complete.  \n\nI've also enjoyed their fish and chips.  Catfish is my favorite, but the other fish is also very good.

Let's compare.\n\nLocation::::::\nRoscoes' are typically found downtown LA or in a ghetto. This Lo-Lo's is found in a Phoenix Suburb. Edge: Lo-Lo's.\n\nParking::::::\nI've been to three Roscoes' and the parking situation is always a dinky little parking lot and/or metered parking. This Lo-Lo's is found in plaza with an Albertsons'. Edge: Lo-Lo's. \n\nWait time::::::: \nThe only time I have ever waited at a Roscoes' is when I had a party of 12. The wait at Lo-Lo's had a wait time of over 40 minutes at 10 AM. After waiting more than 40 minutes, we were finally seated. Edge; Roscoes'\n\nService::::::\nRoscoes' servers take your order quickly and you get your food extremely quickly as well. Our server at Lo-Lo's seemed nice at first and took our order quickly. But that is when things went south. I order a \"KK's\" and a Sweet Iced tea. It took 20 minutes to get my sweet tea and 30 minutes to get our food. In the mean time, I watched an empty table get occupied by two people, their orders taken and food served within a span of 10 minutes.  All before I got my tea. WTF!? Edge: Roscoes'\n\nWaffle:::::\nHave you ever had Eggos? If you have, you know no amount of butter and/or syrup will make it special. Enter Lolo's waffles which were essentially plate sized Eggos with no flavor. I only ate one out of two of my waffles... and I LOVE waffles. Roscoes' waffles are just better. I don't know how they make it and what they put in it... but Roscoes' famous waffles just melt in your mouth. Edge: Roscoes'\n\nChicken:::::::::\nThe chicken at Roscoes' is terribly dry EVERY time I get it, no matter white or dark meat. This was the best part of Lo-Lo's. The chicken was juicy and the breading was seasoned well. Next time I go I would probably just order the chicken. Edge: Lo-Lo's\n\nSides: ::::::\nI had the grits and eggs with my \"KK's\" platter. They were definitely \"authentic\" because I felt awful after I ate them. Grits drowning in butter and eggs drowning in cheese? Edge: Even\n\nMenu/Prices:::::::\nExpect roughly the same price and menu under different names. You're going to have the same plates: the one wing and one waffle, two wings and two waffles with a side, etc. etc. I would say the prices are within a dollar of each other. But they have Kool-aid at Lo-Lo's. I haven't have Kool-aid since I was a kid and I don't plan on every having any in my life again. But they're pretty pound of the fact that they have it on tap. Edge: Even\n\nPortion size:::::::::\nI typically finish my food at Roscoes' and I'm completely suffered. I ate half of my \"KK's\" and I was dying. Heart-wise AND stomach-wise.  I literally couldn't eat any more. The portion size at Lo-Lo's is so ridiculous you could literally split any of the major combos with another person and still be full. My \"KK's\" lasted me from about 11 AM all the way until 9 PM at night. Edge: Lo-Lo's\n\nConclusion:::::::::\n\n1) Why did I bring another establishment into my review of Lo-Lo's? Because you cannot possibly deem something the best ever if it's all you've ever had. \n\n2) Some places are worth the ridiculous waits and hype. I don't believe this place is. \n\n3) As far as chicken and waffles are concerned, this place is your average joint at best. \n\n4) At first I thought this place was favoring Giants' fans over Dodgers' fans but then I realized the staff was making both groups wait equally long. Which either means, their service is just bad overall or they would rather tend to locals than the tourists who will flood the town every March. Not a good way to do business.\n\n5) If you insist on eating here, go as a group of two.

I like chicken and I like waffles.  Not sure why I never went but one day I will.  Here in AZ we have Lo-Lo's.  Tons of great reviews and an endorsement by Charles Barkley was good enough for me.  A chicken and waffle meal was definitely going to happen on this trip.  This morning it did!\n\nWe cruised into the place around 10:00am and there were a couple of people already grubbing down.  We were greeted by a nice gentlemen named Carl.  He told us to grab a seat wherever we wanted and that he would be over in a minute.  He cruised by and got us started with our drinks.  I ordered myself a Red Kool Aid..my wife got water.  Carl brought back our drinks in these huge mason jars.  I was impressed.  They freaking have Kool Aid on tap here.  How cool is that?  I started to drink my \"Red Drank\"...it was delicious!  Super duper sweet but I am down with that.  It was refreshing.  Haven't had Kool Aid that good since my grandma used to make it when I was a kid.  Between Kool Aid and Tang, my grandma knew how to mix up the powdered beverages.  Anyways.......  We placed our order with Carl soon after.  My wife and I both decided to get the Number 5...the Sheedahs Special.  Its one waffle, one breast and one wing.  We also got a side of collard greens.  Less than 10 minutes later our food was up.  Here is how everything tasted.....................\n\nWaffle-  Large waffle with a huge dollop of butter on top.  It came with a little thing of syrup too.  I noticed right away that the waffle was pretty soft.  I prefer my waffles to have a little crisp when I bite into them and this one did not.  It still was pretty damn good though.  It held the butter and syrup well and I ate the whole thing.  You could sense a hint of cinnamon and something else in it...maybe vanilla?  I couldn't pinpoint it.  It did its job though.\n\nFried Chicken-  I got hooked up because my wife gave me her wing so I had 2 wings and a breast.  The coating is a light breading.  The chicken was perfectly cooked, crunchy outside, moist inside.  It was some damn good chicken!  By far the best part of the meal.\n\nCollard Greens-  These were just alright.  I've only had them once or twice before and unfortunately I liked them better the previous times.  I tried to power through most of these but left some uneaten.  I would not get them again.\n\nOverall this place was great!  Carl provided great service and was genuinely friendly and cared about what we thought of the food.  He was on top of everything and made our meal enjoyable.  It was damn near perfect!  A little crunch/crisp on the waffle and we have ourselves a perfect meal.

If you're well reputable for your service and flavor, I can understand flies on the tables/bar, and employees eating while serving and busing tables without washing hands in between all three tasks. Sure it's a food safety violation and somewhat dirty practice but I'll look the other way. Why? because I've eaten some off of some of the dirtiest street food vendors in other countries and had a blast. So, what does this rant have to do with anything?\n\nA few days ago my cousin and I went to Lolo's Chicken and Waffles over on Thomas and Scottsdale for lunch. The host greeted me with a seemingly sincere smile, took my name, and informed me of a 30-35 minute wait for a table for the two of us. Sure, I don't mind waiting 30-35 minutes for a table to try some good chicken. So as we waited, we played some Brave Frontier on our phones because we're into that and all. at roughly 40 minutes into our wait, I had noticed people that arrived after us and had added their name to the list of waiting groups had been getting irritated with their waits (some had been seated already), and I vowed to inquire with the hostess if there was an update on our wait time, as it had been past the approximated wait time, after I finished my current level of the game on my phone. Since my phone is quite slow at this game, it took me nearly ten more minutes to finish my level. I walked up and before I could ask her anything her horror filled face revealed she had completely forgot or overlooked my cousin and I. I looked on the notepad and saw my name had already been crossed off. Whatever, things like this happen, that's why you ask nicely for an update. She immediately seated us at the bar. The bar was a nice coated wood, somewhat easy to clean, dark, and really deep. Deep enough so that I couldn't reach behind it, so around 4+ feet. I thought it was a nice way for my cousin and I to arrange for our large bodies and large orders of food to be presented as well as in reach for us to do all the hipster things like instagram, hashtag, snapchat, tweet and post pictures of our food and dranks in mason jars. On to the workers:\nI rarely post negative stuff online because it could be a fluke, a bad day, or some other misinterpreted account for why I had a negative experience at your restaurant. Perhaps your preps decided to not level the measuring cups, or round/accept 4.95 kilograms as ten kilograms, or your line cooks decided to slack off in cleaning stuff and there's leftover oils and spices from earlier. Whatever your reason is, I don't care. I know it happens in restaurants, let alone ones with food safety regulations clearly being violated in the front of house. What I do care about is if you touch everything from the butter scooper at the expo window and move the scoop of butter that has fallen on the muffin with your bare hands in front of me, when I know you didn't wash your hands after touching a bunch of other people's food, the counter, your apron, your shirt, and your pants.

Or so I had hoped. Here's what the two of us ended up ordering (text from their website):\n\n-Lolo's Famous SoulFood Platter - 3 pieces of Chicken Southern Fried (got three thighs) w/ 2 side orders & cornbread. For the two sides, we got Cheesy Grits and Mac n Cheese.\n== The thighs were okay, definitely juicy but lacking in flavor. the chicken tasted bland, and 1 of these thighs were so bloody at the bone the meat around it tasted like iron. The skin was nice and crisp, but all I could taste was \u6912\u76d0 flavor, aka salt, pepper, and either 5spice and msg or just msg. Not necessarily bad, but not what I expected from a 'southern soul food' place. The Mac n Cheese was super cheesy and not bad, but not why I chose Lolo's for lunch. Cheesy Grits got a scoop of butter on top. why? Cornbread was dry and had a decent muffintop/honeyglaze and also came with a scoop of butter on top. \n\n-#1 - 3pc chix southern style, 2 waffles, grits & 2 eggs with cheese & onions\n== Sam Yu's food; I didn't taste this as it was nearly the same as my orders. Honestly we didn't share much. \n\n-#3 - 3px chix (thigh, leg, and wing) prepared southern style, with 2 golden waffles\n== This thigh was also bloody. Ate around it. The leg was abnormally large, looked like it was frenched rib, and was terribly dry. The wing was actually juicier than the drumstick. Strange but true. So the chicken wasn't fantastic here, but it was definitely expensive. at $2.50 per piece I would definitely not come back for their chicken. Would their waffles be able to pull a last minute win for them? Unfortunately the waffles I received were as dry as Arizona's summer desserts. I couldn't eat it alone, or with some of the butter I had transplanted from my cornbread and the scoop from my grits. I noticed at this point my cousin's waffles came with syrup. Since I was being a stubborn child I didn't request some syrup and just left their waffles to be that bad. dry, hard, and nothing special.\n\n-South Side Chili Cheese Fries - Hot fries topped with our homemade chili & cheese\n== My cousin's, and after all the stuff I had tried, I didn't both trying this.\n\n-Grape Koolaid\n== Wow that's sweet. I let the ice melt a good amount before drinking it in order to let the water dilute the Koolaid. Novelty mason jar, but wayyyyy sweet.\n\n-Lemonade\n== My cousin also reported a great disturbance in his blood-sugar levels after drinking this.\n\nInstant regret. Ordered way too much food for the two of us, but for me that meant leftovers I could give to the dog or myself later. Sadly I probably won't be returning here on my own volition, unless it's to accompany somebody else / give it a measly second chance. Maybe my expectations were set too high, maybe I've been spoiled by Crispy Fried Chicken in San Diego, or maybe I'm just too damn critical about food.

Gravy came with the Baby Ray; it was brown with lots of onions. Love the onions but would have preferred white gravy like my friend had on his chicken-fried chicken. Next time I will know better. The waffles were a 7 as well. They forgot the grits which was very disappointing to my grits-loving friend. Cost was $47 for the three of us. We don't think it was worth this much money.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Imagine that KFC and the Waffle House had a baby....well, you would get a Lo-Lo's. That description is accurate but does not really do justice to how good the food is at Lo-Lo's. Plus you can't get Kool-Aid  at KFC or Waffle House. The waffles are really where its at! The chicken is maybe a little above average, but it does have a little kick to it.\n\nI had the Lo-Lo which was 3 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles. The waffles were fantastic. They were large, soft, and golden, done just right. The chicken was a little spicy for my taste and I found myself putting more syrup on it, which actually turned out to be a good thing. \n\nThe side orders were a good size and I would recommend the fried okra. Overall everything was good, but overpriced in my opinion.

After searching online, I was unable to find any solid info on the place and decided just to go ahead with purchasing the Groupon and trying it out for myself. \n\nThe restaurant is located near the intersection of Rancho & Rainbow, just across the street from the Sante Fe Casino. They are two doors down from Dimas Tacos, inside the lot where the old movie theater used to be . The interior is kind of basic but has a nice homey, welcoming feel and they keep it very clean. There's a good amount of seating, but they offer to-go orders as well.\n\nWe were seated by one of the owners, Yvonne, who was kind enough to answer questions about the restaurant and the food. She explained that there used to be another restaurant in this location called Dirty South, which I had never heard of either. When they took over about 7 months ago, they revamped everything and changed the name. They still offer classic soul food dishes, but after investing in a new $7k smoker, smoke complaints from neighbors down the street forced them to put their BBQ efforts on hold. Apart from that setback, they still have a decent amount of items on the menu including oxtail, chitins and even an AYCE option. \n\nI ended up ordering the fried catfish dinner. For $12.99, you get 4 decent sized pieces of fish, 2 sides and a dinner roll. The catfish appeared to be very fresh and was cooked well with a nice tender, flaky interior. My only complaint is they were a bit heavy handed on the coating/breading, so it was slightly overpowering. The flavor was decent and not overly salty, but I think they went to light with the pepper and spices, so it lacked that slightly spicy kick I prefer in fried fish. I was also able to sample the fried chicken and even though it wasn't as crispy as I think fried chicken should be, the batter was really good and had a nice, subtle heat in it. If they do the same for the fish, it's winner, winner catfish dinner! Screw the chicken!\n\nUltimately, the sides are what really stood out for me here though. They have quite a few to choose from and it tastes like they put just as much love into the sides, as they do into the main dish. We ended up trying the collard greens, fried cabbage, mac 'n cheese and the potato salad. Both the greens and mac 'n cheese were some of the best versions I've had as a side at any restaurant. They do a sweet potato salad so I wasn't a huge fan of that but the fried cabbage was absolutely incredible. It's perfectly cooked with sweet, salty and spicy flavors but they throw in fresh peppers, giving it an amazing texture too.\n\nIf you're in the mood for desserts, they have a handful of homemade offerings. Unfortunately, the lady who makes peach cobbler was out of town so we didn't get to try that, but we did order some banana pudding. I could tell it was made earlier as the bananas were starting to brown and the wafers were slightly soggy, but the flavor was still very good and I wouldn't hesitate to order it again.\n\nI'm not sure how this place has gone 7 months without making it's way on to Yelp but I sure hope they stick around. Not only do we need good spots to eat in the NW, but Yvonne and company are great. I don't drink sweet tea and even though we were the only ones in the restaurant at the time, she offered to brew unsweetened for me. Above and beyond service like that is hard to find and its much appreciated. Legends Caf\u00e9 will certainly be seeing me again!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 8, "useful": 13, "cool": 10}}, {"text": "The boo found this spot! I am always excited when it comes to BBQ or soul food. (Do I say that alot? I get excited about a lot of things... lol) So we decided to give it shot. I was relieved to find out it was fairly close to us. Located in the shopping center across from the Santa Fe Station Casino where a movie theater used to be. That is now replaced by a church. The Santa Fe Mining Company is in that same shopping center, just go all the way to the back. Honestly we would have never found this place just driving by. \n\n Once we got in, we found ourselves to be the only ones there. I don't know why, but that always makes me nervous. Our server, who we came to find out is one of the owners, sat us wherever we wanted. It was actually quite nice being the only ones, meant VIP service ;). So after chatting a bit we found out that there was no BBQ due to complaints regarding the smoke from the smoker. So that left fried foods. I wasn't complaining, I never turn down an opportunity to try fried chicken. (not talking KFC here either) The fried chicken dinner - I opted for white meat which came with a boneless breast and 3 chicken wings. Not the traditional way, but I was going to give it a fair shot. It also came with two sides - I chose mac n cheese and potato salad. The chicken was pretty good. I do enjoy ripping it off the bone, but I found this easy and less time consuming. The breading on the chicken was golden, crispy and delicious! Now as for the sides it was 50/50. The mac n cheese was soooo good. Cheesy, gooey and flavorful. The potato salad was good, but not my cup of tea. I am one for a mustard potato salad and this was a very sweet potato salad. I had 3 or 4 bites and set it off to the side, while I picked up the side of mac and stuck my tongue down the inside of the cup to get the last bit of cheese out. It's so very hard to find good mac n cheese, so hold on to one that you find. I am very much used to getting a corn bread muffin or some type of biscuit with my meal, but this one came with a garlic ciabatta roll. Not bad. I liked the change up. So the ultimate kicker here for me is the desserts. I am probably the biggest peach cobbler fan EVER! I have yet to find that one that will leaving me with late night cravings, so I continue on the hunt. Lucky for me they have it as an option. Sadly not available when we were there. So of course I will be back to try it! We did get the opportunity to enjoy the banana pudding. It was delish. \n\nI left so full, my pants almost busted. I can't wait to go back and try something else, but I do hope that the complainers in this world will let us have some BBQ soon! BBQ! BBQ!
