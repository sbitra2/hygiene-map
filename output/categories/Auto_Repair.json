My daughter and I were heading on I-One-Oh from Tucson to Frisco and we stopped here because the food options decrease dramatically as we course the wide Sonoran Desert. What makes the tacos really special are the amazing corn tortillas, which are made there! The horchatas were also sweet and tasty. It's a small family run business.
