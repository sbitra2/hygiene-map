It was going to take something of amazing to break me out of this spell.  It was going to take.....  the best Philly Cheesesteak I've had in Vegas.\n\nA little background:   My dad is from Philly and as such I've grown up with cheesesteaks my entire life.  I've been back east with him a few times and each and every time I have a cheesesteak or two and formulate mental comparisons.   My favorites that I've had there are Jim's and Steve's (side note:  how come 95% of cheesesteak places are opened by people with the most common one syllable names in the US?)   When I read about Hank's opening up, and right by my house nonetheless, I'll be honest I was a little wary.   While I'm not picky in the least bit and can eat anything from a homemade cheesesteak using steak-umms and american cheese to capriotti's version to stake out's etc etc and be happy, I also realize that it's incredibly difficult to replicate geographic favorites all the way across the country.  I tried to keep expectations low knowing that there was a good chance this would be \"just another cheesesteak\" \n\nAfter chatting with the owners for a few minutes, my hope started to rise.  Hank (is it safe to presume his name was Hank?  I forgot what he told me) was telling me about the kind of meat, the differences in meats between various places back East, and basically was a walking encyclopedia of cheesesteak knowledge.  If this guy isn't updating the wikipedia entry on cheesesteaks, he should be.  Then the golden words:  he told me that his cheesesteak was most closely going to resemble Steve's from Philly.  SOLD.  \n\nI ordered a Philly Joe based on recommendations here, and I also ordered cheese fries and some hot cherry peppers on the side because I'm a glutton for lactose intolerance and hot fiery things in my belly induced punishment.  It was definitely worth it.   For $6.95 you get 9 inches of the best quality steak I've had on a cheesesteak out here.   Whatever it's costing him to fly this meat out to Vegas, it's worth every penny.  The cheese got all gooey and messy and it helped that I devoured the whole thing in about the same amount of time it would take most people to finish unwrapping it.

I had narrowed it down to three places, but there was something about the reviews that pulled me to Hank's.  I was rewarded for trusting my instincts.  The couple that owns and runs the place is charming and delightful, with thick Philadelphia accents.  \n\nI ordered the Philly Joe (1/2 cheese whiz and 1/2 melted american with grilled onions) based on the couple's recommendation.  It took a while to make, but it was worth the wait.  First off, I don't like 'american' cheese, but this wasn't anything like kraft singles.  The sandwich was glorious.  Have you ever had something so delicious that you regret eating it quickly?  It was out of this world.  \n\nThe meat is high end ribeye, so you're not going to get a huge amount of steak if that's what you expect, but the taste is phenomenal.  The bread may have been the most amazing thing: the perfect firmness and it really makes the sandwich memorable.  It is a little messy to eat, but I wasn't even self-conscious about licking the wax paper.\n\nI've never been to Philly, but I've had cheesesteak sandwiches from over a hundred places all over the country, from Subway to gastropubs and everything in between.

They have the meat and bread delivered all the way from Philadelphia. Usually other cheesesteak shop's bread gets soggy but not this place.

Normally i like to add some spicier options to my cheese steak, but the options here were limited.  I do not like onions, or mushrooms, so I was left to just get a fairly plain cheese steak.  I wish they had some sort of hot peppers, but if they do it was not clearly advertised anywhere.  The bread was fantastic, seemed like it was homemade.  For cheese they have options of cheese whiz, provolone, or American.  I ordered provolone.  The cheese was ok.  The dissapointing part was the meat.  They used sliced beef instead of chopped.  I am not against either option.  The issue was that the meat severely lacked in flavor.  It seemed like there were absolutely no spices or anything to this meat.  The meat needs to have flavor otherwise what is the point.  I would much rather have a cheese steak from Capriotis sandwich shop or several other places that I have ordered from in the past.
