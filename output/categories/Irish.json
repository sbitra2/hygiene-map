That being said Claddagh has become a bit of a favorite family tradition for my father, grandmother and I.  The Greenway Station area falls about halfway between my father's shop in Paoli and my work.  We started meeting up for late lunches on Fridays and dinners on other nights, and I've always been impressed with the food.  I wasn't quite sure of the place before my first time there but over the last few years I've grown to really enjoy the atmosphere.  My father, despite never being able to pronounce the name, considers it one of his favorites in Middleton.  My 92-year old grandmother tagged along with him once and ordered the corned beef and cabbage, which is the largest single serving meal I have ever seen.  She's come along a few more times since because of it.  My grandmother absolutely loves corned beef and cabbage and she can tuck in pretty well on it.  Then she takes the rest home and has dinner for the next three days.\n\nI personally like the fish and chips.  I don't eat much fried fish (never been one for the vaunted WI Friday Fish Fry) but I do enjoy the way Claddagh uses a large cod filet and doesn't make the fish too greasy.  The \"chips\" are pretty delicious thick pub fries and I actually really like them with the tartar sauce that comes with the fish.  I also learned that I like malt vinegar.  I wash it all down with an Imperial pint of Smithwick's or two.  The sandwiches that I've tried have all been quite good.  The version of the Rueben comes with coleslaw instead of kraut but this actually comes off really well.  The meatloaf sandwich is perfect comfort food in the winter.  Unfortunately my favorite sandwich was taken off the menu about a year or so ago but despite that there's plenty of options to go with.  My father and I have gotten the lunch specials of the shepherd's pie and the beef stew, which was perfectly sized, filling but not coma-inducing.  Of course I have no idea how \"authentic\" this all might be since this was the first Irish-themed restaurant I've been to.  I would compare it favorably to the food at Brocach downtown or Erin's on the east side.\n  \nFor a chain restaurant in a new shopping center on the outskirts of Middleton I would rate Claddagh a solid 3.5 to 4 stars.  My expectations have always been met or exceeded and the staff have always been friendly.  The names are all pretty hokey - Brian Boru steak salad! - but that's kind of part of the charm.  I've got friends that get a bit worn out by the Irish music in the background but I've always kind of enjoyed it.  There are bands every so often at the restaurant and bar service goes pretty late.  There is an outdoor patio that is OK during the warm months, though it does just look out on the parking lot expanses of Greenway Station.  I've stopped in a time or two for drinks and the bartenders have always been exemplary (much like Brocach), but the main reason I keep coming back is for dining and the friendly convenience.

We did not have any food, so this review is based solely on our experience while having a few drinks at the place.\n\nOnce we were seated, the server came over to take our drink orders. Curious, I asked how the hot apple cider (\"spiced rum & hot apple cider served with a cinnamon stick\") was, and our server told me that she didn't know because she doesn't drink and doesn't know anything about alcohol. OK, fine, it's totally fair to not drink (I didn't for a long time), but shouldn't the answer automatically be, \"It's great,\" when a customer asks how something you sell tastes?\n\nAnyway, we proceeded to place our order, and she brought them out. Everything was fine, although The Wife's Claddagh Coffee Martini (vanilla vodka, baileys irish cream, kahlua, tia maria & coffee; garnished with coffee beans) was very sweet and, seriously, not very strong. We had our first round, and then it was time for round #2.\n\nThe server came back over to again take our order, and we had some questions. I asked, \"Your menu says 'We like to mix things up[, so] ask your server for more draft & bottle selections & our rotating & seasonal taps! Ask your server for additional choices due to limited supply.' So, what additional beers do you have on draft?\"\n\nShe replied with \"I, um, I don't know. I don't drink, so I don't know. I think it's, like, the usual ... Coors, Miller ...\" That annoyed me - the menu says to ask my server about additional drafts not listed on the menu, and my server doesn't know the answer to that really simple question.\n\nOur friend then asked, \"OK, well, what seasonal brews do you have.\" She gave the same answer, \"I'm sorry, I don't know because I don't drink.\" At this point, I just gave up, and it has nothing to do with the fact that she doesn't drink. If you work as a server at a restaurant or bar, your job is to know the menu and the answers to customers' questions. If that means you need to know all the ingredients in a sandwich, you memorize 'em. If it means that, even as a nondrinker, you have to memorize the drinks menu, ESPECIALLY when you work at an Irish bar/restaurant that makes a majority of its money from alcohol sales. I mean, COME ON.\n\nSo, she lost out on what certainly would have been a higher-margin sale (I was interested in the Warsteiner seasonal, which is undoubtedly more expensive than the local New Belgium Fat Tire), and also indicated to me that the staff at Claddagh aren't well-trained.\n\nFinally, for the 2nd round, The Wife ordered another Claddagh Coffee Martini, but directly asked the waitress to \"Please make it stronger than the last one.\" When the martini came out, it was all wrong. First, it was brought out in a snifter (according to the waitress, they had run out of martini glasses. What bar runs out of martini glasses?!). Second, there was a head on the martini (yes, that's right, the martini was frothy). Third, this one was as weak, if not weaker, than the first martini.

Just don't go on St. Patrick's day, unless a jam-packed anxiety-inducing fiasco is your kind of scene.\n\nThe ambiance is your standard Irish pub fare - dark wood, heavy tables and chairs, a fireplace of sorts, and random Celtic symbols and signs all over. There are TVs sprinkles throughout the restaurant, mostly concentrated in the bar area. They're often showing international soccer games, though they'll generally show any popular sport, so I've come here for the occasional NFL or NBA game. They don't have the sound on, but they do use closed-captioning (which, incidentally, makes Joe Buck's observations seem even stupider than usual, but I digress). The restaurant itself seems pretty clean, but that's a bit difficult to discern between all of the dark surfaces and dim lighting.\n\nThe staff is usually cheerful and happy to serve. On occasion, I've been in when the host(ess) is nowhere to be found, but that usually rectifies itself when a server notices me standing there waiting to be seated. They are fairly attentive and helpful, although I was a bit alarmed last week. A bat had gotten in through an open window (this would be one of many reasons why screens on windows are a very good idea in a restaurant), and it was obviously in distress, trying to get out. Bats happen to be my favorite animal, so I was happy when it was able to find its way out by itself and fly off, although not before our server went on a rant to us about how all bats carry rabies and she wanted a tennis racket to \"finish it off.\" Yikes. Occasionally a company will be doing a promo event, so it's a little bracing when the reps come up to your table to bray a commercial for their product.

They also have Team Trivia of WI every Thursday night, and the host is fantastic.\n\nMost of the food is good, but not great. One standout dish, which is especially fantastic during a hot summer evening, is the duck salad. The duck isn't overcooked or greasy, though there isn't too much of it on the salad. The tomatoes, sun-dried cranberries, and oranges complement it well, adding a nice combination of sweet and tart flavors. I recommend the cran-raspberry vinaigrette for a dressing. The Galway and Fruits on the Green salads are also recommended for summer eating. The loaded pub chips are good for sharing, but not as good as the ones at the Brocach (although you can make them better by asking for BBQ sauce and ranch dressing instead of just ketchup). The fried pickles are pretty good, largely because the pickles are in chip form instead of spear form. That equals more crispy goodness and less \"sweet Christ on a cracker, that's a torpedo of boiling pickle juice that just burnt my entire mouth.\" The spinach and artichoke dip is tasty but VERY heavy; I'd save it for cold, rainy fall evenings. Other go-to dishes of mine include the Shepherd's Pie and Chicken Curry. The French Onion Soup isn't bad, but it's quite salty. The Corned Beef & Cabbage is a fairly bland snooze-fest. If you want a burger, go Jameson Burger or go home. The beer selection isn't fantastic, but there's some local stuff on tap. One surprise I found on their generally-overpriced menu is a reasonably-priced flight of whiskeys that were fairly tasty.\n\nOverall, this isn't a place I dream about, but it's worth the occasional visit with friends when you're looking to watch a game or play some trivia.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Monday Lunch Special: Buy one get one free Fish and Chips.\nFish piece was the size of my arm.

We had beer, shared an order of the corned beef and cabbage rolls, and split a \"Paddy Mac\" sandwich, which is essentially a Reuben. The food was quite good. I especially enjoyed the corned beef and cabbage rolls, which when I went, were similar to a fried wonton that had the fixings of St. Patrick's Day dinner inside. Sort of like an Irish egg roll. Yum. The Reuben was average, but the fries were pretty tasty as well. Service was unremarkable in either a good or a bad way. All said and done, I would usually rank that sort of experience as four stars. Normally, I would definitely return to a restaurant that showed me a good time and had good food. \n\nWhy then, you ask, is this a one star review? Let me explain.\n\nI take major (MAJOR) issue with Claddagh's use of the words \"gluten friendly\" to describe certain menu items. (Menu items that are often served with bread.)  I presume this was done in an effort to appeal to the now-popular dietary trend of avoiding gluten. The problem with this, Claddagh, is that \"gluten friendly\" is not a thing. If someone can't eat gluten, then they can't eat gluten. Period. Full stop. \n\nCladdagh's use of the term \"gluten friendly\"  to describe foods that still contain gluten, would be like if JIF Peanut Butter made a new type of peanut butter that was 50% peanuts and 50% almonds...and then tried to market the new product as \"Peanut Allergy Friendly\". Does that make sense?\n\n Although I personally find  vague claims of \"gluten intolerance\" dubious, especially when the person has never had a problem eating gluten before, there are definitely people with a **medical diagnosis** of Celiac's disease who absolutely, under no circumstances, can consume gluten. I feel that Claddagh's attempt at marketing its menu to appeal to the \"gluten-free\" dietary trend could harm people who actually need to avoid gluten for important medical reasons. Even if it's not a life or death situation, people who wish to avoid gluten should be allowed to do so without having to jump through hoops and worry about being tricked by menus. \n\nIt's majorly unethical to twist words to imply that a thing is something that it's not. This is especially true when the item in question (food) has the potential to directly impact a person's health. \n\nCladdagh: fix your menu. If you want to offer gluten-free options, then please do so. However, referring to a spinach-artichoke dip appetizer served with crostini or to a hamburger served on a wheat bun , or even to your fish fry, which is battered in flour as \"gluten friendly\", is unethical. People have a right to know what's in their food, and this feels like a deliberate attempt to mislead people in the name of making more money.", "review_stars": 1, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 8, "cool": 4}}, {"text": "Had a couple wonderful experiences here.

To begin my dining experience, I found the darkness in the pub to be overwhelming (a word I'd rather use in this context is \"oppressing,\" but I'm trying to lighten up!).  I wouldn't have minded so much (as I could've sat closer to the door left ajar, which allowed light to come in), but then the music blaring out of the speakers overhead was just too much!  To compound the situation, the song selections were either U2 (which I liked) or jarring Irish punk rock (which I don't), most of which were of the latter.  :(  Perhaps I should've walked away after making these observations, but I've had FM bookmarked for at least six years now, and I wanted to get it over with.\n\nAfter many inquiries about food preparation, the bread used (which company?  specific ingredients used?), etc., I decided I'd go w/ the crabcakes and the braised rib sliders.  The crabcakes (topped w/ roasted red peppers and garnished w/ wasabi and mustard mayo, the latter I opted out) also came w/ a side mixed greens salad and a citrus vinaigrette. While this dish wasn't the best-looking of all the dishes I had that afternoon- don't let the pic of the bread pudding fool you, it was the best-tasting, but this isn't saying much.  I didn't care for the watered-down flavor of the citrus vinaigrette, and frankly, the crabcakes had enough flavor, so the lack of dressing wasn't a big deal.  I don't know if I'd order them again, though...  What was a big let-down was the braised shortrib sliders' dish.  Now these sliders looked fantastic, but the shortrib pieces were so sinewy and/or fatty, that, as much as I tried, I couldn't chew through any!  I really wanted to like these, bec. of those gorgeous-looking fried onion strings that sat on top of each slider.  Thankfully, my server offered to swap them for something else, and it was w/ a little sadness that I said goodbye to those onion strings :'(\n\nLately, mussels haven't appealed to me, so my server's suggestion to try FM's wasn't giving me much hope.   Surprisingly, these mussels tasted OK, and the price is right (for happy hour), and if I weren't already not disappointed in the darkness of the pub; the loudness of the music's volume; and the sub-par quality of the shortribs, I may have enjoyed them more.  With the hope of finding something good to write about, I ordered the bread pudding.  (At this point, I should've just given up.)\n\nThe bread pudding dish, which you'd think, looking at the pics I took, would taste good,  was a disaster!  It was dark in the pub, yes, but the dish looked like they just placed slices of bread down, showered them w/ dried cranberries, and poured some white chocolate sauce.  Something was amiss- was it even baked?  How was it prepared?  There wasn't enough cream sauce to cover most of the bread.  I was told that the bread was indeed soaked in the cream, and then baked, but this bread pudding had to be the worst I've ever tried.  The pics looked great, but don't be fooled...  \n\nThe server was friendly, and most of the stars reflect her attempts to appease me, but I didn't enjoy my experience there, and would never recommend this place to anyone.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 7, "cool": 4}}, {"text": "I've been out to Fibber Magee's a couple of times in the last few weeks and I am becoming a fan.

I used to love this place, I really did.  There was a time when a group of my friends considered Fibbers to be their seccond home - and we were here at least two or three times a month.  (Some are there almost daily - I would only make the trek a couple times a month.)  The drinks were poured well and reasonably priced, the food was tasty and the music was great.  Real craic in that room!\n\nNot sure what happened over the past couple of years - but WOW, last night was hit and miss across the board.\n\nA group of us met to bid farewell to a friend moving out of state.  The drinks are still solid (they have REAL ginger ale, which is getting more and more rare with many bars opting to mix coke and sprite for the right color - flavor be damned.)\n\nThe food was pretty spot on, too - though I am not thrilled with some of the menu changes and don't get others.  (Gone are the fried mushooms - which were fantastic.  For an Irish Pub - why the section of Medditerannean flatbread pizza??  The items I saw were well presented - but along with the \"upgrade\" to the menu, some of the local pub flavor has been lost.)\n\nI had the fish and chips.  With the size of the cod filet that showed up, it's a damn good thing I was sharing with another gal - that sucker was HUGE!  The beer batter was flavorful and fried to crispy golden perfection - the cod was still moist and tasty - a truly enjoyable dish.  It was on a bed of fries - somewhat thicker than shoestring, but thinner than normal - skin on and well cooked.  The coleslaw was OK - seemed commercial grade - but nothing wrong with it.  \n\nSo - why only three stars?  Service and music. \n\nOur server was adorabe.  Cute, sweet, friendly and great smile.  And damn near totally inept.  There were five of us at our table.  With the first round of drinks, three of us asked for water in addition to our libations.  None of us got them.  So we asked again when the food was dropped off.  Nothing.  The party next to us had some styro cups and an almost empty pitcher of water.  I grabbed the cups, filled what I could, and took the pitcher to the bar to get refilled.  When we wanted a fresh round of drinks, it took over 20 minutes of empty dinner plates and empty cocktail and beer glasses before she came around.\nNo pre-bussing was done as plated were emptied - and when she did come by to grab dishes, she looked so focused and didn't make eye contact that without grabbing her, it would have been impossible to ask for more drinks.  The disturbing part was when I ordered an Irish Coffee (yes, I am aware that Irish Coffee is not from Ireland - it's from San Francisco - but in this day and age, ordering Irish Coffee at an Irish pub just makes good sense.)  The look I got from our waitress was a combo of deer in the headlights, confused, and \"what language did you just say that in?\" Happily, the bartender knows just what it is, and I received a good one - but the look she gave when I asked for it was more than a little unsettling.  And noted by the people around me, as well. At the end of the night, I had to search the bar to find her to get my tab. I guess that's the irony of of the automatic 18% gratuity for groups.  She doesn't actually have to WORK to make the money.  Why should she?  Do a half assed job and get 18%, or truly work and do a good job and maybe get another 4 or 5% on average?  So - it's there to ensure she doesn't get stiffed, but it also doesn't provide any reason for her to do a decent job.  Sigh.\n\nThe band was really, really bad.  They used to bring in local bands with Irish flavor - who were GOOD.  The band last night (and from conversation with regulars, most of the bands of late) could not be classified as good.  But, what they lacked in talent they more than made up for in volume.  The best part of the show was when they took breaks.\n\nSure - it may not be fair to take a star away from the establishment based on my feelings toward the band - but it was impossible to overlook.  If that's the caliber of bands Fibbers is bringing in on weekends now, I think I know what I will have to do in the future.\n#1 - only show up during the week\nand\n#2 - sit at the bar.

Just amazing.  And the broth is bacony and oniony and peppery.  They give you one slice of very good garlic bread per order, which is really not enough.  That order should come with two pieces so I don't have to pay a buck for another one or start dipping things like french fries and tacos in that wonderful broth.  One of these days I'm going to ask Kevin to hook me up with a dirty martini with about a 1/2 shot of that broth.\n\nWe typically get the fish and chips, which have always been perfect, but today for some reason I tried something different.  I had the pork tacos app for my meal and it came with four fat stuffed little soft shells with some tasty tomatillo salsa and pico de gallo.  Tender pork and flavorful salsa.  My belly was very happy.  I topped that with a Newcastle, and then was feeling frisky so I asked Kevin for one of those Three Olives Froot Loop drinks.  Great dessert.  Trust me.  The Baileys Bread and Butter Pudding is a stellar dessert choice as well.  \n\nMr. M had the cod sandwich and it was fried perfectly, as the fish always has been there.  It may seem simple to some, but there's really an art to cooking fish.  It doesn't take much to overcook it and whoever is frying it up back in Fibber's kitchen knows what they are doing.   I don't usually eat a lot of fries but theirs are like crack for me because they are skinny and brown and salty.  Mmmmmm mmm mmm.

They have a very well-rounded selection of craft beers on draft from around the country that is rotated very often... I would assume more than just a seasonal rotation. Besides the crafts, they offer up all the traditional pub favorites on draft as well, my personal fav being Smithwicks. They also serve up their own special cocktails and offer a full bar, as well as a menu chocked full of traditional Irish pub food. I have had the garlic fries before, and they were OK... I have had better  (sorry Meagan B.!) Next time I am there, I will what my diet can allow me to eat, and report back with my review on the food.\n\n\n~Atmosphere/Service~\nEach time I have gone, I have been there when my favorite Irish Rock band \"Keltic Cowboys\" were playing. Being a loud band, the atmosphere was obviously a bit more upbeat. But, that tells me that this location knows how to get the place rockin' and keeps their customers happy. Different flare is located across the wall, from sprots to different Irish heritage signage. The inside is predominantly wood based, so its got that old-style bar feel, nothing contemporary to this place. It is not overtly loud when the band is not playing, however it can get crowded on busy nights, making it a tad difficult to get to the barkeeps. The bartenders are knowledgeable, and helped me pick a couple brews out when I first started trying to get into darker colored beers...So hats off to them! Service is a bit lacking, however, from the waitstaff. This is due mainly in part to the fact that they had 1 person running tables, during a show, on a SATURDAY NIGHT. That's not helping anyone...not the waitress who is trying her best, or the customers. We barely got touched during our 2+ hours there...I'd say about 3 times....that's no bueno. So note to management, get an extra body out there to help everyone out!\n\n~Extras/Rating~\nOverall, this place keeps serving me well. I really love coming here, and despite the 25+ minute drive from Phoenix, it is totally worth it when a band is playing or if you have some friends whom want to relax and kick back.

This place used to be consistently great with service and food but I'm sad to say it's not anymore. \n\nBegan earlier this summer when the food started being hit or miss. Some days it was the stellar food we all came in to have at lunch and other days... not so good. To the point that the last three times were bad and the large group of us haven't gone back and probably won't. The food thing came down to if a certain chef was working - if he was there, good; if not, bad. Started asking the waitresses and figured out the trend. \n\nFast forward to today and that chef has left and no longer works there. Which leads me to understand why the last 3 times in a row the food has been subpar. Like what makes a tomato hard? wasn't green or unripe but hard like... tough to cut hard. wtf? I don't know enough to know this is a reason the food has got worse but typically if you're looking to franchise you get different food vendors that can deliver the same type of food to your locations all across the country. So think frozen foods instead of more fresh stuff etc. I mean it makes sense.\nAlso when you have a trained Chef quit whom made great food, and tailored to groups that wanted more expensive off the menu lunches and catered for local businesses & events... something's up. I can only assume it was the quality in food and the new direction... \n\n... meaning... I also found out (chandler news and biz journal) that Murphy's is wanting to franchising and changing their name to Irish Republic and some of what's going on inside. Girls with slightly different garb... kilt's and knee-high's. etc. Not so much breastaraunt-ish but similar. \nTrademark Info: http://www.trademarkia.com/irish-republic-public-house-85274024.html\n\nService... much like the food the service has gone down in quality. There never seems to be enough girls during what used to be the lunch rushes and an hour lunch quickly turns into 1:30 lunches waiting on fill-ups and food and the check. It's not horrible service, girls are nice and friendly, just slow. \n\nIn summary:\nWe haven't returned in at least 4 weeks and it's just not an option when thinking of places to eat downtown Chandler anymore.

I know that she did not purposely mean to make the face but she did. I honestly wish she would have told me not to order it. It was not good, it was very bad in fact. Dry, tasteless, overcooked meat with a semi hard bun. I should have sent it back but I instead decided to suffer through half of it which is retrospect and a stomach ache later, was a bad idea.

After arguing with her for several minutes she finally agreed to substitute the ranch for 2 dipping sauces, but no more than two. So my fiance settled for the BBQ & the Buffalo sauce.\n\nWhen the order came out however, not only was he brought the ranch that he didn't want, he was also brought all 3 of the sauces he originally asked for. Which at first seemed like a great sign that maybe Shae had decided to change her attitude and settle on the fact that the happiness of her customers was more important than her urge to be rude and belligerent. But then we got the bill... Sure enough, Shae charged my fiance for each one of the dipping sauces. \n\nWhen our server came back to collect the check, we asked her why we were charged after Shae had agreed to sub the ranch for 2 sauces. The poor girl got super uncomfortable, because unfortunately she was forced to play the middle man. So I told her that our issue was not with her, and to please bring Shae back to the table to sort this issue out. \n\nWhen Shae approached she started mumbling under her breath and rolling her eyes, which is always a great sign that you're going to get the resolution you're seeking... So I pulled out my phone and started video taping the conversation in case she decided to pull the same type of attitude as she did the first time she graced our table. That seemed to get her to change her tone and she reluctantly removed the sauces from our bill.\n\nIt's a shame how one employee can completely ruin what could have been a wonderful experience.

No music just akward silence. Waitress said a lot people use there phones to read the menu!! Manager n is about this - that's a problem! It's like they don't know what they want to be - tortilla soup as the daily soup in an Irish restaurant - odd! Linen table clothes that continues moving all over table. There is only maybe 4 items that is Irish on the menu, it all over the place. Then they have steaks at the price of Shula's... Uh no way was I going to try that!\nNow let's talk about the food! It was horrible! The mozzarella sticks were barely warm and they serve the marina sauce cold, no really it's meant to be cold! The Shepard pie, well half of it was burnt and you could smell the burnt cheese. There was no flavor!! And it was suggested - no highly pushed to me and another table to use the HP Steak sauce to make it taste better! Really use a table condiment to add flavor!!! Wheres the meat???? I could barely find it among the frozen peas and carrots! That was disgusting! Sent that back and waitress was nice about that! Round 2 - meatloaf, again no flavor had to soak in ketchup, as waitress pwas asking me about the meatloaf the owner/manager approached table. I told him I'm glad I had ketchup! It has no flavor! He then asked with his hand in pockets and a bs attitude how they should cook! I then explained that my teenage daughter makes a better meatloaf and their shepards pie didn't have flavor either! He then asked how they should cook it and what I would add to make it better! I told him I'm not a chef but you can go to Cornish Pasty on Dobson and Guadalupe and ask them how one done! The guy was a dbag and after asking several times about -well if you can't eat it and it not comfortable for, I don't want to eating. so I told him fine. He grabbed my plate and ran away like a child. He didn't offer anything else or nothing. So We waited for the waitress to return and she dropped the check and they only took of my meal!

This can be both good and bad.  O'Briens didn't have the well-oiled-machine type of vibe that I usually get in chain restaurants, and that resulted in a few stumbles in quality and service.  The manager is often in the dining room or in the bar amongst the patrons. Every time that I've spoken to him, he's been warm, friendly, and receptive to ideas and criticisms alike. In the few instances that it was necessary, he has never failed to make things right for me.\n\nEvery time that I've been in to O'Briens (and it's been MANY times, I assure you), the staff has been friendly, engaging, helpful and attentive.

I certainly feel that O'Briens provides good value for the money.\n\nThe Shepherd's Pie was good, but a little bland for my taste... however, I found out later that it was intended to be that way.  It was supposed to be served with a bottle of HP sauce so that the pie can be flavored to the individual taste of the guest.  My Shepherd's Pie didn't happen to come with a bottle of HP, which was a training issue that was quickly resolved when the manager heard about it.  Since then, I've seen people use a little HP sauce, use a lot, or none at all!  It's an interesting concept, but it works, and I think that it works well for the dish.\n\nWhich brings me to the Bread Pudding.  Oh, where do I BEGIN??

We ordered an appetizer, sandwiches and a desert.  We left with a nicely filled \"to-go\" container and were very satisfied.  FYI, the servings are quite large.\n\nThey set up the building to have the general dinning on the outer edge of the restaurant and the bar is in the center.  What is unique and something that I like is that the bar area is separated from the general dinning room by walls with windows and a set of doors which is nice if you are looking for a quiet dinning experience and are not wanting to listen to the bar activity going on 5 to 10 feet away.  There is also a private dinning area in the back.  We did not get a look at that though.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor is a darker wood, walls and trim but there are a lot of windows and plenty of lighting so that you can read the menu without having any problems.  My night vision isn't what is used to be so that that means there is plenty of light.  lol\nSince we were looking to watch the football games we just headed for the bar.  The dinning area looked nice and clean.\n\nIt seemed like the bar had all the various games on so they must have the NFL package.  If you sit at one of the lower tables you can control the TV at your station and pick whichever station/game you like.  So that is pretty nice.\n\nSo for the food....\nWe ordered the crab stuffed mushrooms for the appetizer.  They showed up and we were surprised by the size.  They were each about 3 to 4\" across and freshly cooked. The shrooms were great and the accompanying sauce was good too.\nFor the main part of the meal, the wife had a Rueben and I had the Corned Beef sandwich.  One had the steak fries and one had the onion rings.  The pastrami was very lean and excellent.  The corned beef was very good as well.  I'm looking forward to going again for the dinner version of the corned beef.\nFor desert, we opted for the bread pudding.  Again it was very good.  The sauce that it came with was the highlight.  Very good but not overly strong the way some will come.  I really enjoy bread pudding and normally jump at the chance to try a new version.  I would rank this up as one of the top puddings on my list.  You definitely need to try this.\nThe service was great.

I loved that they kept the bar separate from the restaurant and was right in your view as you walked in. Definitely inviting, and the color scheme is very warm with rich browns and dark wood.  \n\nAnd when they said \"All of the games\", they weren't kidding! 16 tvs (I believe is what I counted), in the bar area and they did in fact have all of the football games along with basketball, hockey, golf, and even bowling.  Definitely, something for every sports fan.\n\nWe were greeted by two bartenders, one who had been there since they opened in September and the other was her first day. Both were incredibly friendly and I have to give props to the \"veteran\" bartender who informed me after I ordered a bloody mary that their mix was very spicey and she can make it less spicey for me if I like. I really appreciate a bartender who gives details like that and it was an A-MAZING bloody mary. To my surprise, it came with a slim jim. Who would've thought it would be good!? Well, it was and after I told a few friends about it, they made their way to join me in about an hour.

It was clear they were understaffed but those that were available definitely gave it their best service.\n\nWe ordered the fried pickles and McNachos and I was incredibly impressed with the portions for both.  A nice helping of fried pickles definitely made me happy and the batter was nice and light and had a bit of flakeyness to it which was perfect. The McNachos were HUGE and very tasty.

I was impressed that they answered the phone, it sounded quiet in the background, and their kitchen was open until 12. \n\nIt is right behind the Fiesta Mall and had plenty of parking. When I walked in it was spacious and although there were several people it was not too busy - and it was quiet. We sat down at 9:20 in the bar area. There was a guy cleaning tables beside us and two servers that walked by multiple times. The hostess came in, gave someone a menu, and left. We still waited. \n\nI looked at everyone as they waited on surrounding tables or walked by, yet we went unacknowledged. I stopped someone and asked if we could get a minute. We finally received one and it was some minutes before the server came to our table. When she did she said \"oh wait - let me get some paper to write down your order\".

I saw her occasionally walking around, yet we still had no drink. 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. Still no drink. I understand the food would take longer, but the drinks? I looked at their clock and it said 8:57. I stopped a different server walking by told her I was five minutes from walking out.

I said apparently a time consuming lemonade and Guinness because we can't seem to get one in under a half hour. He looked shocked and asked what food we ordered. He apologized and said he would check on it. I reminded him he was down to two minutes and I didn't care what he did with it. \n\nHe did hustle and brought the lemonade and Guinness, and apologized. Then he went into the back and immediately returned with a plate of corned beef and cabbage. We had also at some point added mozzarella sticks and he returned a couple of minutes later with those. Our original server came by and she said \"oh, sorry\" and asked if she could get anything else for us. I said how about a second set of silverware. She said okay, but we never did see that surface. \n\nAnother server stopped by, apologized and said \"there have been a lot of mix-ups tonight\". She said the manager would stop by and talk to us, but he was with someone else right now. The helpful male server stopped by again to see if we needed anything, and the manager showed up at the same time. He dropped off another Guinness and lemonade that must have been from the kid's menu. I told him I didn't think I would drink that other beer. He said \"try\", then he walked the male server to the side and asked where we came from....meaning whose table did he take over. Then he said something about taking the food and someone had been waiting for something for a long time - it sounded like he was getting in trouble for helping out. Maybe he took someone else's food. I don't know what their story was, and sorry I we ate your food. \n\nThe manager never did speak to us other than giving us the free drinks we didn't want. They did not take anything off the bill - the corned beef, the cheese sticks, lemonade, and Guinness came to $26.45. We also never received the second set of silverware. \n\nI understand it is St. Patrick's Day and most places are crazy busy. This was not that busy and had sufficient staff coverage.

It's easy to find, right off the 60 on the West side of Val Vista. There's plenty of parking. The restaurant/pub is huge - plenty of dining tables if you're looking for grub. I went during HH. I was looking for beer. My friend and I walked past the bar to grab a pub table - close to the restrooms and where they set up the band on Fridays. \n\nWe ordered our drinks quickly and then scanned the menu for anything that might strike our fancy. There was plenty to choose from, and it all sounded great. What to nibble on? We went with the fondue appetizer - you can't go wrong with a freshly baked pretzel, sliced apple (two different kinds) and gooey cheese greatness. It hit the spot, along with our brews. \n\nThe bar seemed a bit sparse for the hour of the day. It didn't really pick up that much either, not even as the band began to play at 9:30. The band was a mix of Irish and Blues. I say that because they opened with upbeat, fun Irish tunes and segued into some Blues. I think I preferred the Blues renditions. The band was nothing to look at, of course - middle aged men with thinning hair. But they worked as background music. \n\nMolly's is a fun place. It doesn't have that cozy, quaint feeling of being in a hard-to-find, you're-a-special-patron establishment. Instead, it feels like the TGIFriday's of Irish restaurants. Don't get me wrong - the decor is nice... hardwood floors, interesting things on the wall, a restaurant slogan that makes ya chuckle. I just much prefer a swankier place. \n\nSo, why 4 stars? Probably was the company, the conversation we had in a place that was relaxed, friendly and serving us both some damn fine beer. (Guinness anyone?) Plus, our nibbling plate of caloric wonderfulness was a treat. Who knew fondue at an Irish bar was going to be any good? I certainly didn't. Oh, and the music was fun. I suggest checking out their website to see which bands are playing, for they seem to invite a large mix of musicians - Something for everyone, I guess. \n\nSo, if you're looking for an easy, simple and middle-of-the-road Irish pub experience, Molly's is your place. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Review based on one experience.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "This was such a great idea for this area but it is too small for what could have been.

Let me start by saying, Rula Bula is the most understated bar on Mill Ave. Amongst the cherry pits, taverns and middle-aged somethings lurking at The Library Bar (why is that, anyway?) Rula Bula is like a big warm bear hug. The usually have a pretty steady lunch and dinner crowd - it could stand as a restaurant in its's own rite - fish and chips are not as greasy as some, and the potato \"rounds\" are perfect. My favorite is the Vegetarian Shepards Pie, but @ $10-$15 per meal we don't eat here frequently. BUT we do drink here frequently!  \n\nAround 9 or 10pm they have live live music every weekend. This is THE ONLY spot on Mill that you can find live, good local music. The bands change every night - but my local favorites are Shawn Johnson and the Foundation (a perfect blend of Hootie meets Sublime meets your favorite cover songs) and the Irish band that always plays there (I have no idea their name!) but they really bring down the house. Between 11 PM - 2 AM the band really creates a sort of \"collective\" atmosphere - everyone that is inside dancing (or jigging) to the music. \n\nThe crowd is the perfect blend of young college kids, late twenty-somethings and an older crowd. It has a great neighborhood, eclectic feel. \n\nThe drinks are average price - roughly $5 bucks for a mixed drink and $3 for a beer. My favorite is a Snakebite (which is 1/2 cider - which they have on tap- with 1/2 Guiness). If you like a lighter beer, try the Snakebite w/ Harp instead. \n\nLike many of the other reviews have stated, they have a huge outdoor patio area (great if you aren't into the music and want something a bit more low-key).\n\nLiving in Phoenix 8 years, I have never been to a bar that makes me feel this good.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 5, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "Hands down the best bar in Tempe.

For a variety of reasons, I was unable to pick up my card for a few days. Because of this Rula Bula put a pending charge on my credit card for $25 because my card was \"left overnight\".\n\nProblem #2: management. In conversing with the manager via email, I received excuses, and was told several times that I was wrong about the credit card charges about which I complained, even after verifying them multiple times with my card company. In my emails I also listed several shortcomings I had noticed regarding the level of service, and received absolutely no input from the manager.\n\nThere's no excuse for poor service, lost cards, non-comped drinks after such an egregious mistake, and no real apology.

Oh, well, c'est la vie!\n\nFirst off, I was expecting a kind of dingy dive bar but the interior is actually quite nice looking. I liked all the little Irish knick-knacks they had around the place.

Our server was friendly and attentive and the food came out really quick.\n\nI ordered the strawberry salad because I knew I was having a big dinner later that evening and I didn't want to fill up. Surprisingly, instead of the boring iceberg lettuce you would expect from a bar salad they had a nice spring mix. The strawberries were very fresh and the grilled chicken was cooked perfectly. All the flavors worked really well together and the only criticism I have is that the dressing was a tad too sweet. Overall, a really tasty salad. My fellow lunch companions ordered a burger, fish and chips, and shepherd's pie. All of their plates looked really good and they all enjoyed their food. I will definitely order the shepherd's pie next time since this is a favorite dish of mine and they serve a nice small lunch portion that you can get with a salad to keep the meal from being too heavy.\n\nHopefully I'll get to try this place for a few drinks in the evening some time but until then I will definitely be back for lunch.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 5, "useful": 5, "cool": 5}}, {"text": "Bartenders are friendly and the environment was chill. i liked it", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Ah R\u00fala B\u00fala.  How far you have fallen in recent years.  What once was a warm, friendly and enjoyable \"home pub\" venue has changed over the last several years into a disorganized and seemingly mismanaged establishment.\n\nIf you are in any way familiar with Mill Avenue and Tempe, you likely know about and have been to R\u00fala B\u00fala.  It is a literal cornerstone of social and gastronomic life on Mill Avenue in Tempe. Having worked in Tempe for nigh on 15 years now, I've been a patron here for many a year.  Once the highlight of an office outing or a simple lunch with a friend or co-worker, the last several visits here have resulted in poor service and mediocre food.  \n\nWe have a fairly large group to accommodate (10-15 people) and as such, always call ahead to make reservations.  Our last trip here at least started better than the last few (in which they completely forgot/ignored our reservations and ended up having to wait for them to clear customers and tables for us).  The tables were indeed ready for us upon the specified arrival time.  I was somewhat glad that we were on the back patio area, as the interior of the restaurant itself was overly warm.\n\nOur reservation was for 15 and 14 of us were there within a few minutes of each other.  Drinks were fairly prompt, though all at the table commented that their drinks (from soda to water) all had an odd taste to them.  Perhaps the ice had been tainted with something?  Also the soda's were all very flat and watery.  \n\nWe then proceeded to wait a good 20-30 minutes awaiting someone to return to our table and begin taking orders.  We finally flagged down one of the servers and his comment was along the lines of, \"Oh, are you ready to order?\"  Now, it's possible that they were waiting for our last person to show up.  Maybe.  However, any seasoned server knows that group luncheons are a dynamic event.  There are often times less or more than what the reservation is made for.  Some show up late, some leave early.  If it was in question, a simple \"Are you all waiting for someone or are you ready to order\" a few minutes into our arrival (like when they delivered the drinks) would have resolved this.  \n\nWhen a server finally did attend our table, his greeting was prefaced with the suggestion that we split our entire tab into 15 equal amounts to make it easier and faster for him to process upon completion of our meal.  Never in the whole of my gastrological life has a server suggested that we structure our payment in a fashion that is more convenient for them.  Be that as it may, we quickly discussed it and agreed to this.  We had already been there some time and as it was a work luncheon, didn't have a limitless amount of time.  \n\nOrders were taken and then the next long wait began.  An hour after arriving, our 15th member joined us and we still did not have our food.  Unfortunate or fortunate?  At least he got to eat with us, right?  \n\nShortly after this, our food arrived.  For myself, I ordered the bangers and mash.  Pretty traditional dish for irish pub food.  Three half portions of bangers, served on a bed of mash with a red onion gravy.  Back in the day, my favorite choice here was actually their Pub Whiskey Burger.  They made a pub whiskey sauce that was phenomenal.  Sadly, it was removed from their menu a few years ago.  \n\nThe bangers and mash is normally quite good but today it was fairly blas\u00e9.  The sausages themselves were okay, could have used a bit more searing.  The mash was good but not very flavorful.  The gravy had no signs of onion in it.  And normally this dish is served with either the vegetable of the day or brussels sprouts with apples.  For some odd reason, mine came with... irish chips.  Sliced, fried potatoes to accompany my already sizable portion of mashed potatoes.  \n\nCurious choice for certain.  If there had been a question as to what I wanted, they should have asked me.  Under normal circumstances I would have asked for the normal veggies or sprouts to accompany my meal, but this long into the lunch, it just didn't seem worth the fuss.  \n\nOnce we left, we pretty unanimously agreed that this was likely the last group luncheon that we would be having here.  It's sad to see such a storied establishment fall into disarray and mediocrity.  I hope they can make adjustments and improve.  Taken from their website, \"Irish pubs are a retreat from the real world and at the heart of R\u00fala B\u00fala is the ready smile, the invitation to relax and enjoy good conversation, great food and drink, hospitality and humour.\"  This has not been our experience here in some time.\n\nThere is a lot of competition on Mill, which is only growing with the improving economy.  Robbie Fox's down the street has new ownership and will be re-opening as Public House on Third.  It also happens to be right next to our office building.  Where once we journeyed to the opposite end of Mill Avenue to patronize R\u00fala B\u00fala, we may find ourselves having our luncheons a bit closer to home.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Joe was effen awesome.

It's especially fun being a native reading a book by a native, because protagonist's shop is on Mill, and is bookended by stores that actually do exist. He lives in Tempe, just south of ASU, and he's got his own favorite joints to eat at. All of which are local.\n\nWhich is also where Rula Bula comes in.

But my husband did, and holy cannoli, they are good. Crispy and light, tender on the inside. I got the braised beef & Guinness boxty. Because I'd heard about boxtys before, but what WERE they? Are they good? Could you really go wrong with beef slow braised in Guiness? The answer, wee bairns, is no. Holy cannoli did I mention it was good? Savory and rich with a hint of bitterness. And a boxty is a bit like a crepe. It was stuffed with the meat, and you ripped it apart with your fork (no knife really needed), and shoveled this goodness into your mouth. My girlfriend got the shepherd's pie, and you know it's a good place when they master the classics. I'm not sure I've ever tasted a shepherd's pie this good. \n\nThe drinks menu was also pretty cool- I always enjoy trying out whatever craft cocktails they claim to have. Mine was... okay.

But anyway, the bouncers were nice, and I couldn't believe how much we kept walking around outside. There were all kinds of seating arrangements to bascially accomidate any kind of group-from tables with umbrellas, to benches, to regular four person tables, to chairs arranged in a circle to even ladies lounging on these kind of upraised curb thingies, I was impressed with the variety. I felt I had stumbled onto a crazy backyard house party! The crowd was def. younger, but the huge groups of guys were polite when they bumped against you (your clue that this place is PACKED). Although there was tons of seating, there still weren't really any seats. We went in for the beers, but I saw another secret door at the bar and two guys walk in so my bar scene spidey sense went off and behold-two chairs at a table open! I gestured to my bro and snagged it, and lit up a horrible vice and people watched on the porch. It is def. a scene here, but it is pretty relaxed-I def. agree with that. He got me a guiness, which was fine (one gets spoiled by the countless irish pubs in Boston), and then the porch filled up. It is a little difficult to catch bartenders attention since the bar can go three people deep wanting drinks! I want to try the food, but the prices are def. steeper than I am used to...so I will have to let go of my east coast cheap oysters, I guess!

I hope to provide some detailed information to help you get the best experience you can when coming to this neighborhood bar.\n\nFirst off, there are beer specials every day. If a review states that the beer was $3.50 it was either on happy hour or was the beer of the day. Most of the beers on draft are regularly $4-$4.50. They also have a decent selection of bottled beers (and Boddington's in the can).\n\nThey have a board inside at the end of the main bar that has daily specials, this will usually consist of a higher dollar specialty item and desert along with a lower cost lunch type item. Just ask your server and they will give you the run down.\n\nIf you are in the mood for a very fast appetizer, the clams or shrimp will arrive in usually less than 5 minutes. Other apps come out as usual 10-15 minutes. Sandwiches and salads run about the same time depending on what needs to be cooked. I personally recommend the Hippy Sandwich with Blackened Chicken.\n\nIf you are looking for less of a crowd avoid Thursday-Saturday, as said before the bar is very popular and the weekend warriors come out in packs. Tuesday is a great day to come out, the special is Black and Tans but you can get either Bass or Guinness for $3.50 all day/night. \n\nA good place to park is the alleyway behind Buffalo Exchange or the parking lot to the east of it. If it's a busy night don't even try to get in the main parking lot.\n\nSunday's a bartender named Tyler works the outside bar and he makes a seriously spicy Bloody Mary.

She'll take your money, talk some shit with a mischievous smirk and you might even get a genuine laugh out of her from time to time; but she is my bartender and not yours.\n\nYou see dear reader; I know Peaches from a time long before she was a bartender and even before I fell in love with and was heading to Casey Moore's on a regular basis.  That is to say I know her from the \"real world\" that we one and all leave behind as soon as we stumble past Casey's gates and on to its rustic yet ample and cozy patios.  We've been friends longer than you've been trying to score her number or weasel a free drink from her; which are big No-No's in the bar world.  Peaches is fast, funny, friendly, fair and no, she won't go out with you; so stop asking.  If you get surly with her she'll give it back twice as hard and even when Casey's is packed to the gills on a Friday night, with her behind the bar you'll never be waiting long for that next thirst quenching libation.   Combined with how absolutely fucking awesome she is at her job, my pension for draining brews and the fact that Casey Moore's is going to be around forever, my patronage to this place isn't likely to waver anytime soon.\n\nOf course Peaches is the reason I still go to the place.  With the death of the Mill Ave of my youth, it is harder and harder for me to bring myself to make the freeway dash from my compound in Central Phoenix.  But this is a bar review blog, so if she is my bartender and you are either new to the valley or have been living in a hole for the past decade here are some reasons non-bartender related to fork over your hard earned doe for a night of drinking delights.\n\nFirst off and foremost, Casey Moore's is one of the last holdovers from what Mill Ave and downtown Tempe once was, a living breathing, drunken time capsule if you will.  It is an iconic relic of days past when Hayden's Ferry still actually made flour, before the dried up Salt River bed was terraformed into a stinking, mosquito infested swamp and when the only tendrils of corporate Americas extension was Fat Tuesdays.  Everywhere you ventured were dive bars, tiny music venues, independent stores and family owned eateries.  And now a decade later Casey's is the last bastion standing all alone as a reminder of the \"good ole days\".\n\nThe bar itself is technically a restaurant, serving up very good if not slightly over price grub.  It also one of only a handful of places in this desert oasis that I would recommend eating an oyster from; that's right, ice cold and on the half shell honest to goodness oysters.  It is a great place to grab a cool one on a beautiful October afternoon and the solace of the location (in a residential neighborhood and literally, off the beaten path) is broken up at random intervals by passing freight trains.\n\nOn the drinking side, Casey's has a cramped interior where you can throw a few darts or pony up to the bar; and if you are feeling froggy you can even grab an honest to goodness meal in the interior dining area.  But where the place truly separates itself from the pack is the patio.  Running the entire length of the property it is an enormous \"L\" shape.  There are tons of trees, tables, benches, heating lamps (for those chilly winter months) mister systems and hurricane fans (when it is hot), a Koi pond, full service outside bar and the infamous Blarney Stone all of which make the outside hospitable and desirable year round.  There are a dozen or so beers on tap and most days and night there is some of drink special running for all you college kids on a budget.  Even though Casey's has a hardcore following of loyal customers, the medium age for patronage is roughly 21-26 and due to its proximity to collegetown a vast majority of these are college students and artistic types.  During the summer months, when all that is left in this sun scorched hell on earth are the hard core locals and those too stupid to leave, you will find me there.  And maybe if you are lucky enough you can join me and find your own bartender, just like mine.\n\nCasey Moore's has no cover charge and proper attire is never required.   Depending on what is going on in the valley (or more specifically Tempe) it can be packed to near capacity or eerily dead.  Food is slightly over priced and actually pretty good.  There is almost always something on special so ask your waitress/bartender.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 3, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Love the ambiance here, and it doesn't get any better.

When i've been boozing and taking shots (which is usually the story with me and Caseys) i've been known to order multiple rounds of their greasy mozzarella sticks. They are obviousy the frozen-fry kind of food but when you got a good buzz going on, nothing beats the mozoralla sticks. Drinks at Caseys aren't expensive, and they are free poured. Which is always a plus in my book for any establishment. Mixed shots are huge. Service at Caseys is always hit or miss. You either get one of the servers/bartenders who has been there forever and gives you decent/good service with attitude/personality or you get stuck being served by someone who is new (rare) or the chick with the mustache who never smiles. Either way, your service isn't going to be the best but it won't be god awful. And when it comes down to it the ambiance will help you overlook any shortcomings.

Most of the patio is shaded, and there are lots of trees surrounding the restaurant itself. You will find all sorts of people at Caseys, but mostly the tattoo covered and pierced kind. If you're looking to go to Caseys on a Friday or Saturday night here is my advice on getting a table (which my roomie and i became pro at). First, stand in the middle and scope out the tables... Who is paying their tab? Which table has empty drinks? Who is leaving soon? Pick out your target tables. Now send in your blockers, have some of your friends stand in front of other people trying to scope out tables. Now when you finally see a table leaving, sit down as fast as possible.

They have their own wandering cats, a koi fish pond, blarney stone that doubles as a restroom and apparently this place is haunted too.

The servers are always friendly and used to large amounts of traffic.

It's literally five minutes from my house in Tempe and everybody and their mother loves it here. I've been here four times. FOUR CHANCES, and they blew every single one.\n\nVisit #1: I go with a handful of girlfriends. Order a margarita. Worst margarita of my life, hands down. My friend also ordered one and hated it. We both had to send it back (the first and only time I have ever sent a drink back. It was that bad). We told our server that we'd like something different, but we needed a moment to decide. She rolled her eyes, took them away, and we didn't see her until much later, when she delivered our bill. I had no drinks that night.\n\nVisit #2: I went with my husband for lunch. Ordered the crab sandwich. I took a bite and it was an effort to swallow it, it was so disgusting. Now, I used to live off of eating out just about every day of the week. My husband and I are always incredibly polite to our servers and feign enjoying meals that are sub par. Getting meals you don't like is a part of life. This, however, was inedible. For the second time ever (I never send food back, I know how annoying it is for the servers and feel so bad), I had to send it back and ask for something different. Our server seemed really perturbed, but did bring me the meal I ordered instead. It was mediocre at best, but I ate it without any complaint. I apologized profusely to our server and assured her that I liked the new meal, even though I didn't, in hopes of her mood improving. It didn't.\n\nVisit #3: Don't even ask me why, but my husband and I were craving Oysters and thought that we'd give Casey Moore's Oyster House another chance to impress us. Not only were the oysters not good (we did not complain about them this time, though), but our server was so rude that we thought we had wronged her in some way. Dirty looks, only stopped by twice I believe in the hour and a half we were there, didn't say hello or smile once. We thought maybe we had caught her on a bad day, but the joyful smile on her face as she laughed with the table of men directly across from us quickly made us realize that this was not the case. To be clear, we did not complain about anything at any time. We were kind, polite, and didn't keep her from other tables. What the hell?\n\nVisit #4 (tonight): I went with a girlfriend for drinks after a run. I only went because it was a beautiful night and I wanted to sit outdoors. First off, we had my friend's dog with us and went to the front without the dog to see if we could tie him up outside of the establishment (around a tree). Nobody was there so we went back to get the dog to tie him up (again, outside of the place, by the sidewalk). A man promptly and rudely said, \"I'm not letting you two in with that dog out there.\" Okay. So we took the dog back to the car and left the window down for him. When we got back and found a seat, I smiled and said hello to our server when he greeted us. Upon asking us what we wanted to drink, I said, \"There is a drink at Boulder's (bar down the street) I really like and was wondering if you guys might do something similar...\" \"We don't.\" He said, and just looked at us. That's it. I proceeded to tell him what the drink was (Strongbow mixed with a Raspberry type beer). \"No, I told you we don't.\" Finally after awkwardly floundering about, my friend and I settled on another drink. We did get what we ordered and it was good (we both got Strongbows with a shot of Fireball). But seriously, dealing with TWO rude men tonight, plus the history I've had there, makes me realize I really will never go back ever. And I mean it this time.\n\nI mean truly, I am extremely polite and go above and beyond to make people feel comfortable and happy to be serving me.

Wednesday night was quite slow and very quite.  My g/f and I sat down and ordered a round of drinks and an appetizer.  The server was nice and service was quick.  \n\nMy family and I have been there numerous times in the past with no issues of having my family member under 21.

Apparently the door man has said the only way a minor is allowed in is to sit inside, not on the patio.  Again, this is 100% different than the other ten times we have been there during the week.  When I went inside to find out what was going on, I over heard the server saying \"they should go somewhere else, like I care anyway.\"  Wow, that was super rude.  I don't think she knew I was standing there.  Regardless, it was one of the worst customer service experiences I've had.  The worst part is the family is full of restaurant managers and servers.

Aside from the people who drink here(which I'll touch on below), the actual physical atmosphere is nice. I like patio bars.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Door staff are assholes. This is the first place I've ever had a security person anywhere ever lay their hands on me. I walked out the side entrance to make a phone call in a quieter area and told the guy I'd be right back in. Finished my very short phone call within eyesight of the guy making eye contact with him a few times during the call. I walked back into the bar past him. He followed me 50 feet into the bar and grabbed me by the back of my neck and started screaming at me about showing ID every time you walk into the place. I literally talked to the guy not 5 minutes before in order to avoid having to go through the ID process all over again. If it ever happens again I'm calling the police and filing a battery charge. \n\n2. Food is garbage. With the exception of the potato skins, everything on the menu sucks. But it's REALLY hard to make lousy potato skins.\n\n3. Beer menu is small/not really listed anywhere. Ask the waitress which beers they have and she'll tell you a few random ones that she can think of off of the top of her head and say \"and we have others I guess\". If you want Kiltlifter or Fat Tire, you're set. If you want anything else, it's a 50/50 shot on whether or not they have it.\n\n4. Hipster. Central. Seriously the clientele here is atrocious. I've literally been verbally assaulted here for eating potato skins by a waifish, meth-mouthed denizen who was the human embodiment of the lyrics of Macklemore's \"Thrift Shop\" because there was cheese and bacon on my food. He went off on me for being offensive to animals or some such. Telling me I would be a vegetarian if I had to kill the animal myself. On a friday night, the place is packed wall-to-wall with the whiniest, heroin-chic douchebags you will ever meet. I feel like this is the case because they don't like the loud music of the bars on mill so they walk around the corner and park themselves at Casey's.\n\n5. Cops. Lots and lots and lots of cops. If you go here on a semi-regular basis(once or twice a month or more) for a long enough period of time, you WILL be stopped immediately after leaving the bar. The Tempe PD are for the most part nice folks, but the ones who patrol looking to catch a DUI coming out of Casey's are all assholes. Not really the bar's fault at all, but it's part of the experience of going there.\n\n6. Pricing. Two drinks and a plate of aforementioned potato skins? 20 dollars plus tip. Look to spend at least 5 dollars(tip included) for a pint of beer here unless it's on special/happy hour. 7 to 10 dollars for a mixed drink with well liquor(tip included). \n\n7. Parking. 10-15 parking spots in their lot. Yeah. 10 to 15 spots. For a bar that is usually packed to the brim with people. After the stores close down, you can park in the little strip mall parking lot around the corner. But again, there's always a cop car or motorcycle cop just sitting in that lot waiting for you to look like you're walking toward a car. \n\n8. Wait staff sucks. It's always sucked. It's not really their attitude all the time(though it is sometimes). They hire like 3 or 4 girls(I'm not being sexist, they only hire females to do wait staff) to cover what's usually close to 1,000 people(maybe more? I'm not a good judge of actual numbers of people) all asking for booze at the same time. Don't even bother placing drink orders with them. Just walk up to the bar and pay with cash and then go back to your seat.  \n\n9. Bathrooms are horrendous. It's really hard to use the bathroom when there are 2 urinals and one stall for guys. Especially once 10pm rolls around and the holocaust-skinny hipster kids I mentioned above start vomiting in the stall and sink because they can't hold their booze and drinking in a college town means DRINK UNTIL YOU DIE. The blarney stone is all well and good until a dude takes a dump in there. \n\n10. Climate control. Because of the patio setup, it's always too hot or too cold to be really comfortable, save for the few months per year here in the valley that the weather is really nice. It's still 90+ degrees at 11pm here 6 months out of the year. \n\nIf you haven't been here? Don't bother going.

Rosie McCaffrey's Irish Pub is easily one of the top three 'irish' pubs in Phoenix. However, what makes Rosie's better is that it lets go of trying to be something that it couldn't possibly achieve. That authentic irish pub, or even one close to those that you'll find in Chicago, or New York. Again, that's okay. Unlike the George & Dragon which absolutely holds onto it's attempt at being authentically british, Rosie's is closer to actually being an Irish Pub deep in the heart of desert Phoenix.\n\n I've had many, many great nights with friends in the booths at Rosie McCaffrey's. Come with a good group of friends, when the place is packed and the band plays on the insanely small stage - and you're set for a great time. The fish and chips with vinegar are more than decent and often actually deserve whatever award they claim to have recieved. The beer flows and they have the appropriate options on draught. But none of that stuff really matters.\n\nYou can recreate the exact same bar anywhere. You can use the same wood, the same bar, have the same drinks on tap, and none of it matters if your crowd sucks. This is where Rosie's excels. The crowd. The people who frequent. Since it's deep in Phoenix, yet a little off center, Rosie's doesn't attract the annoying Tempe college crowd. It doesn't attract the annoying Scottsdale upper-class pretenders. The people who go to Rosie's actually live in Phoenix. These are hard working middle class city dwellers looking for a neighborhood bar to share a great time with friends - and drink - truly without the pretentiousness so often found everywhere else even remotely popular.\n\nAs far as irish pubs in Phoenix go, Rosie's is top three - but only because they regularly have some of the best crowds. Sure, every now and then you feel like pretending to be someone else and you make your way to Scottsdale (or you feel like pretending to be someone else everynight) but when you just want to be yourself with your friends, and have a great time, not just a good time, Rosie McCaffrey's is the place to go.

As we settled into a comfy wooden benched booth we both began to have a glimmer of hope. The draught menu contained Magners Cider which my hubby had not had since his last trip to England about 10 years ago and I settle on a bottle of local brew that was a mere $3.50! The drink specials were great and it wasn't even happy hour, and to top it off our waitress was prompt with the drinks, they were nicely chilled and she was about as sweet as pie.\n\nThe menu was another pleasant surprise, it is fairly small but with some strong dishes. If you like Boxty, they make it up fresh everyday, and the stewed item is different everyday so please check with the server. We both ordered fish and chips and we were blown away. The server presented us with a large platter of fresh cut fries and one large fillet surrounded by crisp, golden, BEER batter. Yep real beer batter, they even tell you they use Harps in the batter. The fish inside was perfectly moist, and a nice thick cut. No thin fish, fried to fish leather here! The slaw served on the side was fresh, so fresh that the cabbage crunched, no wilted, mayo slather gunk at this joint! Most importantly the tartar sauce didn't taste like bottled, it was creamy with lots of pickle and the malt vinegar was already at tableside.\n\nFor desert we tried the bread pudding with whiskey sauce. Moist and studded with plump rasins, drizzled with thick rich sauce. Absolutely delish! As we were digging into dinner, a live band started their set.

The d\u00e9cor starts with an open patio, and a horseshoe bar surrounded by a score of booths and tables. Last Friday the Sullivan's were on hand to provide the live music that rocked the house.\n\nThe Jinky's Famous Chicken Wings ($8.99) arrived with ten sizable drumettes and they were spicy delicious. The meat was a tad on the dry side, and I wished there were a number of actual wings that could appear on the plate. On the other hand, the explosive flavor was quite striking, addictive, and good to share. This is a good dish to order during game day.\n\nTheir Corned Beef and Cabbage ($11.99) came with prime pieces of corned beef, boiled cabbage, potatoes, carrots, horseradish sauce, and mustard. The thick cuts of corned beef was a tad chewy, but there was plenty of flavor to go with the creamy horseradish and pointed mustard seeds. The cabbage and potatoes were sensational. Portions were generous and good for two meals. This is one dish that I would recommend.\n\nThe Grilled Basa ($9.95) came with a strip of perfectly buttery blackened basa. The fish was tender, flavorful, and had great moisture so it was easy to fork into. This dish also came with a side of garlic mashed potatoes nicely whipped with a mix of potato skin here and there. Fia thought the fish was a tad too salty, but we both really liked the mashed potatoes. \n\nService was friendly, efficient, and fast. My drink was not refilled the first time, but service was much improved during my latest visit. The atmosphere really picked up once the Sullivan's came on stage.

Their fish is fried and tastes delicious, especially with malt vinegar drizzled generously on top.  Their fries are ample, lining the whole entire plate under the large piece of cod.  You find a hint of garlic within this combination of soft and crispy fries.

At his behest, we met up at The Skeptical Chymist.\n\nAt first glance, I was nervous that the venue would be incredibly small. It's tucked away in the corner of a shopping center, between a sandwich shop and a Rubio's. The storefront is immensely wide, but for some reason, it didn't appear that it would be very spacious inside.\n\nTo say that I was wrong would be putting it lightly. When I walked up to the \"Please Seat Yourself\" sign where a hostess might stand during peak hours, I was immediately lost. There was a vast section in the center of the bar that was teeming with people there to enjoy the amazing happy hour specials (from 4:00 pm - 7:00 pm). I had to actually walk around to the right side of this group (through a small seated dining section) to reach the bar.\n\nI only had a moment to gaze at the bar while waiting for Scott D. to arrive. In that time, I noticed several different beers with which I am, sadly, not yet familiar. Though, after the night I enjoyed, I'm sure we will not be strangers for very long.\n\nWhen Scott D. arrived, we ordered a nice stout beer (I'm ashamed to say that I was too nervous to pay attention to the name of the ale). Scott said that it's a good idea to \"start from the left, and work your way to the right\" of the beers on tap. On this night, we never made it past the first tap.\n\nWe picked up our ales, and headed to the outdoor patio (another pleasant surprise).  The patio was surrounded by misters, which I'm sure, offer great relief during the blistering summer months. There was a television in the corner of the patio that was airing the Thursday night NFL game. There was a walk up bar that connected to the bar in the main room. \n\nAt first, it appeared that we got lost in the mix, as it took a while before a waiter came around to see how we were doing. But, once they realized their mistake, they were exceptionally quick to rectify the situation. Our server, whose name escapes me, was incredibly courteous and apologetic for the delay. He asked if we were interested in appetizers...which, after the strong ale, we absolutely were!\n\nScott recommended the \"Pulled Pork Sliders\". Perhaps it was the beer, perhaps it was the situation. But the sliders were great! They come four to a plate (perfect for sharing). And since it was happy hour, we got them at half price ($5.00).\n\nAs the night progressed, there was another round of the same beer. That, subsequently, led to another appetizer. For this round, Scott suggested the Chicken Tenders. Being happy hour, we only paid $4.50 for this dish. Just like before, this dish comes with four chicken tenders, making for another easy mathematical conclusion as to which way the dish should be split. I know they were chicken, but the manner in which these tenders are fried, they reminded me more of fried fish. Whatever the case may be, they were scrumptious.\n\nCue the third round of beers, again from the same tap. (Now I HAVE to return, just so I can figure out what this beer is called!) \n\nWe sat, we drank, we ate, and we were merry. We ended up chatting for more than three hours over drinks and bar fare. So, if you were paying attention, you know that we each had three stout ales and two delicious appetizers during our little pow wow. \n\nBy the time the tab came, I had completely forgotten that we had been drinking and dining on Happy Hour prices. The damage was an astounding $40.00...including a generous tip! \n\nAs we exited the bar (three plus hours later), it dawned on me that there was a stage upon which live music acts performed! This place is WAY bigger than I had originally though!  \n\nAnd did I mention the \"Library\"? I fear I may have said too much already...perhaps when I return, I'll venture into the rest of the nooks and crannies of this local gem!\n\nThat wraps it up for my 50th review.

Prices seem pretty standard to me. Happy hour has great deals and every day of the week has its own all-day drink special.\n\nThe food is really hit or miss. The burgers are amazing and the chicken tenders are great but a lot of their food in general is a bit atypical. For instance, the flatbread pizzas come in varieties including \"bacon onion jalepeno\" or \"date and black pepper\" but just a meat'n'cheese choice isn't on the menu and their \"tacos\" consist of pulled pork and coleslaw. Everything I've tried has been totally delicious, but if you're looking for good ol' simple bar food, you might not like their menu unless you're willing to be adventurous.

I decided to give it another try and what did I get?! Another terrible experience. \n\nI came here on this past Thursday night around 830PM. I wish I knew who our server was because I really wanted to complain. My friend and I sat down outside at a table and then a moment later another group sat down after us. Their table received drinks and appetizers before we even got asked what we wanted to order. We honestly waited about 10-15 minutes before I decided to hunt for a server inside and ask where the patio server was.  I let that person know we have been waiting for about 10-15 minutes and  haven't been approached for anything. This server was happy to go out of her way and at least get our drinks. She was friendly and was hoping she would be our server and not the normal outside patio server. Well, unfortunately the regular outside patio server  ended up being our server for the night. We then tried being optimistic about it and went and ordered both our drinks and food because who knew when she would come around to check in. Well, later the night came and another 15 minutes or so go by without our server coming around to ask if we wanted anything. I ended up going to the bar outside and was about to order when FINALLY the server came and asked if she could help. Whelp, another awkward moment between the server and us. \n\nLater that night, she came around once more and said she was closing out and if she could close our table. We said \"Yes\".

The first for me is that I am not a fan of the flatbreads, I have tried several and none every hit the spot. Friends have had them and enjoyed but this just doesn't do it for me. The other is a hit and miss issue that has happened only for Seahawks games where I have felt that the servers have been somewhat unavailable and slacking when it comes to checking back in. I understand for big events they have lots of tables and are busy but even with that factored in there are some who just don't seem to care. The only reason I even mention this is because there are some who I have seen work their butts off to keep every drink filled and people happy. When the tables around me see their servers 3-4 times before I see mine, it's an issue.\n\nCheck them out but don't dare walk in here wearing enemy colors on game day unless you are prepared to hear all about it from the great fans that show up.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I went here for the lunch special and some beer.

We have been here a few times before and love the atmosphere, food and beer selections.\n\nWe arrived at exactly 7:00pm and I had to use the men's room so my wife found a table. After the few minutes it took me to clean up and found her standing at the table she wanted covered in the mess from the previous guests. There were several other empty tables in the restaurant but my wife like this vantage point of the stage. I sat down and waited a while as we watched servers making their rounds and one even walked by and gave us a courteous smile but kept on walking. We agreed that he must not be our server. I walked up to the bar to read the beer selection chalkboard and returned to the table. Still no server. It is now nearly 7:10. My wife flagged down a mid to late 20 year old male with a tightly pulled back, short pony tail.  My wife asked if he knew who our server was. He just replied with \"Why did you need something?\" My wife said, \"Yes, we need our table cleaned and want to place our order.\" He proceeded to walk away without a response. We sat for another entire song of Jay's set and my wife finally decided to go to the bar to order us a round. As she was approaching the bar, the server came to the table and asked if she was going to the bathroom as he watched her standing at the bar. I told him she was ordering our drinks. He said, \"Nice\" and finished wiping down the table. Yes, he was only wiping down the table 15 minutes after we arrived and was upset because we decided to get our own drinks at the bar.\n\nWe had nearly finished our first drinks and he had not returned to the table with a menu or to see how things were. I finally had to go find a table that had a menu on it. We made our choices and still waited. It is now nearly 7:30 and he is wiping down a table near us so I got up and confronted him in a heated tone as I told him how unacceptable his service has been. I tried to turn it on us that we went to the bar and it was \"confusing\" to him. He was obviously being facetious and I called him on it. He asked me what I wanted him to do. I told him to tell one of the other servers to come take our order.\n\nHe came by our table a few minutes later and made no attempt to recover the situation and only continued to tell us how \"confusing\" it is when a customer goes to the bar to get their drink rather than wait for him. I was so angry that I told my wife I wanted to leave. This was disappointing because we had come to see Jay play and enjoy dinner.\n\nWe went outside and calmed down. Rather than go find another place to eat and miss out on Jay's performance we decided to go back in and find a seat at the bar. We ended up staying until 9:00 and happily gave our dinner and drinks tip to the bartender.\n\nI really don't think this young man has any business being in the service industry.

What came was an egg and cheese scrambler with white toast and a heaping helping of fried potatoes.  Our waiter was perfectly nice about it -- when I asked her about the fruit, she looked at the menu, agreed it was supposed to come with fruit, and brought out a plate of fruit.  And when I asked her about the toast, she brought out some whole wheat toast.  Still, it's troublesome when what's brought out is different in so many ways from the dish on the menu.\n\nThe reviewer who described the breakfasts as capable of feeding 3-4 people must have had very small people in mind.  The eggs Benedict I got today was a single half-muffin, one poached egg, one slice of ham.  That the brunch filled me up at all was due to yet another large pile of fried potatoes.  They were good!  But a brunch of fried potatoes with a side of eggs benedict was not what I had in mind.   \n\nThe place was almost empty, but after waiting a while I had to get up and walk to the bar in order to get my coffee refilled.\n\nIf the food were great, all this stuff would be no problem.

However, it was about 8pm on a Tuesday night, so the lack of waiting was not surprising. The restaurant does look very nice.  The decor is similar to their original Capitol Square location: dark wood paneling, cozy and warmly colored walls, and a very welcoming \"Irish-Pub vibe\".\n\nWe ordered the Beer Cheese Dip appetizer, which came with soft pretzel sticks for dipping. The dip arrived with a  congealed \"skin\" on top, as though it had been sitting out and cooling for awhile before being served. The liquid cheese underneath the solid surface had a bitter, almost metallic, aftertaste. I imagine that the goal was for the dip to have a pronounced beer flavor, but it didn't work for me. It hardly tasted cheesy at all, and the taste it left in my mouth was gross. My dining partner didn't seem to dislike this dish as much as me, so this could be a matter of my personal preference. However, for a $9 dollar appetizer, it should have at least been served piping hot, rather than lukewarm. Unfortunately, this item provided an ominous preview of what was still to come.\n\nMy partner was in the mood for something light so he ordered the American Club sandwich with french fries. He commented that the sandwich, which contained ham, turkey, cheddar, swiss, lettuce, tomato and mustard, was \"extremely average\", and rated it \"5 out of 10\". He liked his fries a lot though, and thought they were the saving grace of his meal. The fries looked and tasted a lot like McDonald's fries, and everyone knows how tasty those are!\n\nIn the mood to splurge with no regard to calories, I ordered off of the \"Mac and Cheese\" section of the menu. I got the Bacon Bleu Mac, which the menu claimed contained: \"trottole pasta, bacon, scallions, cream, bleu cheese, cheddar cheese curds\" \n\nWhat came out to me was: under cooked (hard and chewy) pasta in an extremely dry (nearly non-existent) generic cheese sauce.  The vast plate was topped with about 3 blue cheese crumbles, which was not enough to impart a discernible blue cheese flavor to the dish. There was an overwhelming amount of crumbled-up bacon and no scallions. \n\nThe only flavor in the dish was bacon. I like bacon as much as the next person, but the flavor was overpowering. I gave half of it to my bacon-loving dining partner so that I could attempt to taste the other flavors. I was unsuccessful, as there were no other flavors to be found.\n\nWhen I ordered, I was envisioning a luscious, rich, and creamy dish with a variety of subtle flavors and lots of cheesy goodness.  What I got was a boring plate of plain dry pasta with too much bacon crumbled on top.

It's rare to find an awesome bar, that also has awesome food. Usually I can either a) tolerate the food or b) drink enough crappy beer to not care how bad the booze is, even though the food rocks. I really love the second level of this bar. It's a huge high ceiling-ed place with dark, rich wood bars and cozy lighting. They pump Irish music in (not too loud) to add to it. There's lots of Irish decor and pictures as well. \n\nThis place recently fell from 5 to 4 stars in my book for several reasons. \n\n1. They do a lot of private parties here. You may be turned away every night of your stay.\n2. Prices seem significantly higher. $10 for a pint of Guinness, and it's (probably) neither an imperial or even full pint.\n3. Food seems to be out of stock a lot. Certainly dishes were out of stock several times.\n4. Service.

It's small, deep fried sausages in a little 'bucket.' They are super tender and juicy. It's a meal for two. They also have Guinness pies, which kinda like empanadas or similar.

Nine Fine Irishmen\n\nCraftsteak at the MGM Grand is a wonderful restaurant. The service is impeccable, the decor nothing short of stunning, and you will, without a doubt have a fine meal here - so long as you are willing to pay the price, and a hefty price it is. The real question is if it's really worth it. Regretfully, my answer is - maybe not. \n\nCraftsteak barely misses the mark in my book; expect to pay more than double what you would at other equally good venues. If we bring the total picture into play, not just food, then our measuring stick has to change and I would give the place 4 stars instead of three. For me, I prefer a beautiful, friendly atmosphere and great food over museum-quality surroundings and average to good food. This review is actually a comparison/contrast and hopefully will give you a good idea what to expect. \n\nOur table of three at Craftsteak enjoyed a few drinks then started off with wagyu tartare. It was nothing short of outstanding  - and an extremely large portion! I was expecting 2-3 oz but received what appeared to be more than 1/2 a pound of pure delight. It was opulent. Had I known, I would have ordered it for dinner and called it a night. The three of us actually struggled to finish it - it is very heavy. \n\nOn to the steaks. We decided on a 32oz  rib for two and a 16 oz New York strip. As sides, we ordered the mushroom assortment which included somewhat rare hen of the woods which is a delight in an of itself, and saut\u00e9ed Brussels sprouts. \n\nComplaints... well, I must say the steaks lacked seasoning. Sorry, Chef/Owner Colicchio, it was close but no cigar.  A great steak should need little more than some fresh cracked pepper and salt, our two steaks felt devoid of either. To add insult to injury, the rib was excessively fatty with a rather large grain of connective tissue running through the dead center. This had to be a mistake. The knives provided were surprisingly dull (security issue?) and we had a hell of a time carving through this sucker.  If not for the great company, I was seriously considering sending it back. \n\nWe packed up some of the dinner rolls and the remaining steak to make late night sandwiches in our suite that evening- we were feeling like beached whales after the tartare. The check arrived and I handed over $375 to our waiter. Ouch. Double Ouch. I shudder to think what the bill would have been if we ordered deserts and coffee.\n\nLets move ahead 24 hours to a little Irish joint called the \"Nine Fine Irishmen\" at the New York, New York, right over the connecting bridge from the MGM Grand.  It's a bit loud, but bristling with a friendly, not raucous, energy and live music that was just loud enough that you could still very easily have a conversation. This time it was just myself and my wife. We sat at the deep marble bar (we didn't feel like waiting an hour for a table) and ordered two of the Guinness 250 limited edition stouts. Really yummy (if you like stout). \n\nWe shared a bowl of their colcannon soup which is a hearty blend of leeks, potato and irish bacon. They offered it to us with fresh soda bread and European butter with a herbs. I was simply in heaven. I considered licking the bowl, but there were too many people, including my wife, watching.  It was at this point that I started feeling bitter about Craftsteak. My 16 oz NY strip arrived (round two) and horseradish crusted halibut. Perfection! I was enjoying a great beer with a simply phenomenal steak that was cooked to perfection. The halibut was flaky and succulent in every way. Here's the best part - our bill was $64.. Sixty Four dollars compared to what we spent at Craftsteak! ($375). There simply was no comparison. As much as I think Gordon Ramsay is a pompous ass, (and I have eaten at  his restaurant London), there is something to be said for his philosophy of great, simple food. Craftsteak is good, but with the exception of the tartare, does not blow-me-away. They are missing the mark just a bit by trying to be an over the top. You are paying mostly for a name and a very posh atmosphere. \n\nConsidering the price and the quality of food, Nine Fine Irishmen was the winner for me. Granted, it's not a somber, fine dining experience, but I enjoy eating out to have a good time and a good meal, not just gawk at the decor and whisper in the amber glow of a restaurant that is bucking for a michelin star.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "\"Mc Intires!!!\" \n\nIf Disneyland and some podunk Dublin pub had a love child, it would be \"Nine Fine Irishmen\" \n\nI've never been to Ireland.

Besides them and maybe the Guinness on tap being served there, they were the only true Irish element inside the \"pub\". \n\nYou know what, it didn't matter. They were playing rockous, Pogues inspired Irish Rock complete with Riverdancers. Chants of \"when I say you, you yell Mc Intires!!\" left my throat raw. We pounded about 3 pints of warm Guinness and for a minute, I actually believed I was in Lord of The Rings at the \"Prancing Pony\". The spell worked so well that I hardly noticed when about six or seven guys staged a faux Irish pub fight. How do I know it was fake and there to add to the realism of the joint? Well, they all of a sudden started \"fighting\" for no apparent reason to me (I was next to them) but not a single guy threw or landed a single punch. It looked like a standard playground fight when I was 5 years old. \n\nThe night ended with all of us beginning to speak Gaelic sprinkled with gibberish.

We wanted to check out their Fish and Chips at lunch during Restaurant Week. The $20.11 per person tariff for a three-course meal was the greatest deal we encountered during Restaurant Week, since the Fish and Chips alone cost $16 on the regular menu. And, they were great! \n\nAmbiance was authentic Irish pub plus a large flat-screen TV on the first floor displaying a college football game live. Audio of the game was even broadcast in the restrooms on the first floor, so no sports fan has to miss any of the action on the field. On the second floor, where we were seated at a fairly plain wood table in all-wood chairs, the game was not audible, which is good for those who are just interested in food or drink. \n\nSlices of thick Irish Soda Bread tasted good and wholesome with basil-tinged butter spread over them. A bowl of creamy Colcannon Soup with pureed potatoes, cabbage, leeks, and several pieces of crispy Irish Bacon was a nice and filling, more jazzed up variant of Cream of Potato Soup. But a Mixed Green Salad composed of complex greens and a few reddish leaves, along with cherry tomatoes cut in half, red onion slices, and cubed cucumbers, that included a pretty ordinary Vinaigrette Dressing, was very bland. It tasted much better after small amounts of both salt and pepper were added. \n\nIrish Chips were actually steak fries that were a little crisp on the outside and a little soft on the inside. They tasted good with or without added tomato ketchup. But the star of the lunch was the fish: hot filets of cod that had been gently beer battered and then deep-fried to a light tan hue. Served with the Chips in paper wrapped inside a cone-like metal basket, the fish filets were tender enough to break apart when yanked out of the densely packed cone. But they flaked more in the mouth than in the hand. \n\nThe quality of the fish reminded me of the same quality experienced at a London pub and at a stand on Haight Street in San Francisco many years ago during my law school years. The fish was delicious whether it was eaten after drops of lemon juice and malt vinegar had been spilled on it, or after being dunked in the excellent house tartar sauce provided, or just consumed as it arrived at the table. As Chips were removed, more filets appeared, until three large ones and one tiny one were ultimately exposed to view. Especially after soup or salad, and with dessert still to come, two of the tender fish filets were easily enough to quell an appetite. The rest were boxed up for home. \n\nBread and Butter Pudding consisting of buttery baked brioche punctuated by golden raisins and served with a smooth Whiskey Cream Sauce and a sweet Caramel Sauce was warm and mouth wateringly good. The two sauces were tasty by themselves, but also harmonized well when used in combination. Irish Coffee Cake turned out to be Tiramisu made with Bailey's Irish Cream. It was extremely rich, and a really strong whiskey flavor permeated this dish. Brown and white in appearance, and served in a sherbet glass, it was decadent but difficult to finish. Half of it was left behind. \n\nService was very good. A few needed utensils like a soup spoon arrived slightly late, but the friendly servers realized and corrected their errors by themselves seconds after they were even noticed. The mood of the whole place was quite genial, convivial, and upbeat--probably because virtually everyone present--a mix of tourists and locals--was enjoying the excellent food (and drinks) being served. Besides finding my go-to place in Las Vegas from now on for Fish and Chips, I saw other diners happily tearing into a Cheeseburger, a Sliced Corned Beef Sandwich on Rye, and Irish Bangers resting on Mustard Mashed Potatoes. \n\nOnly a fairly ordinary salad kept my meal from being a five-star dining  experience.

Although i have always been a little concerned about this, i decided that this year i would finally let her. So I grabbed her Lucky Charms and off to New York New York Hotel and Casino we went .  The Nine Fine Irishmen Pub is always busy and the evening that we went was no exception. We did not have to wait for a table, however , when we got seated in the dimly lit dining room, we were greeted with a view of the restroom. This was not ideal, but at least with a complete 360 turn around of our necks we could see the stage where a great Irish folk band was rockin the Riverdance, and a sixty something year old midget in her leprechaun costume ( I'm not kidding) was burning up the dance floor.I was looking forward to seeing a sexy Irish waitress straight from the country side come over to take our order, and i did not have to wait long. Although she probably had some country in her, the sexy and the Irish part seemed to be missing. So with a little disappointment in my voice I placed my order with Marlborough Lung Cancer Granny. I decided that after the leprechaun midget ,Irish folk band , restroom view seating and total lack of Irish tail that a strong drink was needed. I went with Gaelic Punch, it was loaded with a bunch of  Rum(s), and Midori and did the trick. Before long I was smiling like a kid that had just found a four leaf clover.  For the food, Simone and I started out with the Potato Basket. Although not the most adventurous of choices, you really can not go wrong with thick slices of deep fried potatoes. The potatoes were served with Red and Yellow curry sauces that were both very good. And the portion was large, consisting of at least a couple of good sized spuds.  For the entree Simone decided on The Herb Crusted Goat Cheese salad. Although (as discussed in previous blogs) salads are not an entree, I decided to keep my opinion to myself and let my wonderful wife enjoy her rabbit food. The salad consisted of Arugula with other mixed greens, oven dried tomatoes, caramelized onions, and a big heaping spoon full of goat cheese topped off with a Hazelnut Dressing.  Simone said it may have been the best salad EVER.  And she would know, she loves salad- as an ENTREE. For my tastes, I also found it to be very good and the goat cheese was excellent.\nNext up was my choice, a real entree, the traditional Shepherds Pie. Now this was comfort food. No frills, just damn good and piping hot. Topped with a mashed potato crust it arrived in a mini cast iron pot and was filled with tender morsels of sirloin steak, not the ground up junk, but real chunks of good beef tips mixed with carrots, and onions in a thick and rich port wine gravy. The BEST EVER Shepherds Pie. No cream of corn, or any other gross stuff that mom used to put into it (sorry mom) .This was just a simple,  warm your insides on a snow filled night kinda meal. It was excellent.  So ended our visit to Ireland. Although it started off a little scary, it ended great.

We also ordered the pork tenderloin, which while probably the best dish we tasted, was mostly show. I ordered the Blue Cheese steak which was incredibly disappointing; it lacked any seasoning and relied instead on the blue cheese and the horrid au jus style sauce to give it any flavor, but it wasn't enough. It was a huge cut of meat and I would gladly have had half the food with a little better quality and preparation. \n\n I ordered the \"dubliner\" after dinner and while it had Jameson listed as it's first ingredient, it was completely imperceptible to either of us (it tasted like a sickeningly sweet appletini).

That's how bad it was.\n\nThe hostess's name badge said \"Martiza from El Salvador\". I could care less where she's from, but hopefully someone from Nine Fine Irishmen will read this, be able to identify her, and at bare minimum send her back to customer service training.\n\nWe were running about 15 minutes late for our 7:30PM reservation. (HELLO, it's trade show season in Vegas -- it happens.) So, I called into Nine Fine Irishmen, and let them know. I was told on the phone, \"No problem, we'll push the reservation back to 7:45PM.\"\n\nWe arrived at 7:45PM on the dot. The hostess, Martiza, looked at our names and said, \"You're late, so you'll have to wait.\" I informed her that I had the reservation pushed back. Her boss came over and said, \"It's OK, I've got them.\" She was clearly irked, and started yelling as we walked away with him.\n\nAfter he took us upstairs, he said to please enjoy ourselves while we were seated. But, we couldn't find a seat, and no one came to seat us. I went back town to Maritza to say, \"Where was your boss going to seat us?\"\n\nInstead of telling us, she snottily yelled, \"I TOLD YOU there's no seating.\"\n\n\"Well, MARITZA, your boss said there was, and was trying to seat us,\" I reminded her, my patience running out.\n\n\"He doesn't do the seating charts, so he doesn't know. You're late, so we gave your table away. They're almost done, they're just finishing their drinks, so you'll be seated after they're done.\" \n\nSo, let me get this straight. In the fifteen minutes we were \"late\" (which is almost always a window that a restaurant gives you anyway, not to mention I had changed the reservation), you managed to seat ANOTHER party of four, get them through drinks, dinner, dessert, and a final round of drinks.\n\nI don't think so. Martiza screwed up the seating chart, and then had the nerve to, instead of act like a classy, well-trained hostess, go on a pissy-pants party.\n\nAny REAL hostess with real training (particularly in a foodie town like Vegas) would have said something  \"I'm so sorry, there is a little wait due to the rush with the trade show. Why don't you have a seat at the bar with a glass of wine or a beer on us, and we should be able to seat you in just a few minutes.\" \n\nIf she had done that, we would have stayed, and gladly spent our company's food and drink allowance there.\n\nInstead, Maritza's horrible, entitled, condescending, and insulting tone and manner led all of us to decide to eat elsewhere. I said, \"We've decided we don't want to eat here,\" and handed her back the reservations. A huffy \"FINE,\" a slam of our menus down on her podium of stank attitude, and turning to gossip with another hostess (almost certainly about us) was her reply. \n\nWe went to Il Fornaio (also in New York New York), were seated within 10 minutes without a reservation, and had a great meal with lovely and attentive staff. Kudos to them!\n\nI wouldn't step foot back in Nine Fine Irishmen as long as Martiza is a hostess. I hope that Nine Fine Irishmen takes a better look at their hosting and wait staff.

We got there 10 til 10. I tried to flag someone so we could get food order in before the late-night menu started. First girl I talked to said they were not serving food. I asked if they were serving late night menu then, she said \"Ya, but I don't know where the menu is\" and walked away. \nWe waited for few minutes but nobody came to our table, so we gave up and couple of us got drinks from bar (after 10 minutes of waiting at the bar too) Few minutes after, our server came to us and said \"Where have you been? I was waiting for you all to sit down\" Well, One of my friend was sitting at the table for the whole time and the server didn't go over for like 15 minutes, it just sounds like an excuse. We finally got late night menu, which was a one page print out of like 5 things... We got wings, Reuben sliders, and fish and chips. Wing and Reuben came out first. Wings were alright. It was too crispy for my taste and flavor was so-so. Reuben slider wasn't so tasty. Meat was dried out and bun was too hard. Fish and chip came out about 10 minutes later. It was 1 fish. One chunk of fish that was very over done (dark dark brown). Did kitchen guy forgot to take it out of the fryer? Or did server forgot to bring it out and it got cold so they had to fry it again? Either way, it wasn't so good. Chips were very greasy too. And speaking of server... she didn't know what half and half was, or black and tan... she kept asking which beer we wanted. Overall, we weren't happy. \n\nSecond night was 2 weeks later, on a Friday night. \nWalked in, got ourselves a table, different server. Let's see if this night is any better than last time. Nahhh, it was still the same. \nWe ordered drinks, asked for a menu (unfortunately late-night menu again) and waited... She came back with drinks, no menu. So we asked again. Her response was, \"Oh, you want menu? I'll be right back\" She said that first time we asked for a menu! Anyways, she got menu... and disappeared for 20 minutes. You know... if somebody asks for a menu, doesn't it mean that somebody is hungry and wants to order a food? Maybe? Anyways, she wasn't paying attention, so my buddy got up, grabbed a random server that's standing by POS, and asked to put an order of wings in since our server is MIA. As he was sitting down, I see our server getting up from another table across from ours, walked towards us, and said \n\"Oh, did you want to order food?\" so we replied with \n\"Yes, we asked for menu because we wanted to order food. But you were gone for 20 minutes, so we decided to find somebody else\" \nSo then she responded with \n\"Oh, I'm sorry we are slammed. I just got like 10 tables.\" \nHmmmm, I just saw her get up from other table which I could see and she was there for good 5 minutes. What a way to give us an excuse! And we are not stupid, people were leaving, not coming in. The place had half the people compare to when we came in.  And also she was blaming other server for doing her job.

Later of the visit though, she was getting slower, but I could also see she had other tables she was tending. That's fine.

The Reuben was stacked with flavorful corned beef and the right amount of thousand island and sauerkraut on a nice crunchy rye bread. Yum. Enough said. Mom's favorite: the cod. One good sized piece fried to perfection. With the included sides, this was a big portion size. I really liked how the \"chips\" were more or less potato wedges.

I end up drinking cider half the time, which is a far cry from the usual ambers I tend to enjoy.  The do have Smithwicks, which is a decent amber, but not much else I'm excited about.  Of course, they've got the British/Irish kinds of beers, but not as many as I'd like to see.\n\nTheir happy hour appetizers are very good, and fairly cheap.  The crab and cheese dip is tasty, as are the beef curry bites and the guinness mac and cheese (all are 3-5 bucks).  \n\nOh, yeah, FYI, there is absolutely nothing healthy at all on the entire menu, so...be aware if you're into that kind of thing.  Tasty, but not healthy.\n\nThe ambiance here is nice, and it's what keeps me coming back.  The bartenders and servers are very friendly, and there's a laid back vibe about the place.   Basically, it's as close to a decent neighborhood Irish pub I'm going to get in Henderson.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "The last couple times Sean and I have popped around here, we've been very sorely disappointed. \n\nGone is our cute little watering hole pub that we used to frequently hang out in, and instead we find that the place has become very fiscally greedy and capitalistic. \n\nI'm just not willing to pay cover for an off-the-strip pub. I loved me some Fado's but sadly, it's no longer the place I had grown to love. \n\nOh well. Luckily I live right near a Lee's Discount Liquor, and have an extremely nice view from my balcony.

I'm a girl that loves her hot beverages, and the one here is not bad at all.  In fact, it's down right tasty on a cool night.\n\nLast time I ordered food here, I got the boxty stuffed with corned beef and cabbage.  It was okay.  Something that I would go back for?  Probably not.  Something that was horrid? Definitely not.  It was just okay.  The black and tan dessert was pretty good.  I definitely loved the Guinness ice cream more than the brownie.  The Irish coffee was one of the better ones that I've had.  \n\nThe server was polite on the dead night I went on... but he's actually extremely chatty if you get him talking or if thinks he's seen you before.  On a trivia/karaoke night, I could not find the waitress to save my life.  I ended up ordering my drinks at the bar and walking back to my table, which she did notice and immediately apologize.  It was busy, and I know I'm at a pub; so it was not a big deal to me.\n\nWhat this place is great for is the pub atmosphere, grabbing a beer with friends, watching some soccer, maybe a couple of rounds of 2 for 1 Irish car bombs on karaoke night after a round of pub trivia, and watching the countdown clock for St. Patty's Day-- the one night of the year we are all Irish or at least that's what The Boondock Saints taught me.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Cesar salad not good.

I am not giving five stars because I had the best meal I ever have, in fact the kitchen was closed.. I had one guiness, which I may add was a great pour.

The stars are being given for the experience.. It's not every trip to an irish pub that you hear stories about crossiant wrapped wheaties just prior to packing a \"SATCHEL\" with bar glasses, this was a prime example of the good times that can be had here in town, there are some great things to come with this group of yelpers.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "I was sad to hear this bar closed as they had great St. Patty's day parties.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}], "state": "NV", "stars": 3.5, "latitude": 36.0174194}], "85210": [{"full_address": "1010 W Southern Ave\nMesa, AZ 85210", "rest_id": "TwMfahsPHFnkLiqqvyalAQ", "categories": ["Pubs", "Bars", "Irish", "Nightlife"], "city": "Mesa", "review_count": 0, "name": "R T O'Sullivan's", "longitude": -111.8536943, "reviews": [], "state": "AZ", "stars": 3.0, "latitude": 33.3933042}], "85004": [{"full_address": "705 N 1st St\nPhoenix, AZ 85004", "rest_id": "FeI75xIG8PF_XZ6P80gLBQ", "categories": ["Pubs", "Bars", "Irish", "Nightlife"], "city": "Phoenix", "review_count": 0, "name": "The Turf", "longitude": -112.072167, "reviews": [], "state": "AZ", "stars": 3.5, "latitude": 33.455863}], "85003": [{"full_address": "18 W Monroe St\nPhoenix, AZ 85003", "rest_id": "-gefwOTDqW9HWGDvWBPSMQ", "categories": ["Irish", "Bars", "Arts & Entertainment", "Pubs", "Nightlife", "Music Venues"], "city": "Phoenix", "review_count": 0, "name": "Seamus McCaffrey's", "longitude": -112.0743441, "reviews": [], "state": "AZ", "stars": 3.5, "latitude": 33.4504575}], "1 2QN": [{"full_address": "14 Forrest Road\nOld Town\nOld Town\nEdinburgh EH1 2QN", "rest_id": "QmTGCPfHt2L7Og9W7XnOMA", "categories": ["Irish", "Bars", "Arts & Entertainment", "Pubs", "Nightlife", "Music Venues"], "city": "Edinburgh", "review_count": 0, "name": "Malones Irish Bar", "longitude": -3.19086313247681, "reviews": [], "state": "EDH", "stars": 3.5, "latitude": 55.94569135867929}], "85255": [{"full_address": "20469 N Hayden Rd\nScottsdale, AZ 85255", "rest_id": "M8h8cZ4YYFVH8yNHZuKIVg", "categories": ["Pubs", "Irish", "Bars", "Sports Bars", "Nightlife"], "city": "Scottsdale", "review_count": 0, "name": "O'Donoghue's Pub", "longitude": -111.906781, "reviews": [], "state": "AZ", "stars": 3.5, "latitude": 33.671497}, {"full_address": "17050 N Thompson Peak Pkwy\nScottsdale, AZ 85255", "rest_id": "VhraACjnyT90dKMCtxdl1A", "categories": ["Bars", "Irish", "Sports Bars", "Nightlife"], "city": "Scottsdale", "review_count": 0, "name": "Temple Bar Sports Grill", "longitude": -111.862020492554, "reviews": [], "state": "AZ", "stars": 3.5, "latitude": 33.641669499625}]}}
