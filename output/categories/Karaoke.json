The bartender was cute, friendly and promptly brought over our drinks.  My buddy ordered scotch on the rocks and though he didn't complain, the glass was 100% ice with very little scotch.  I ordered a beer - $3.50.  Noticing ash trays throughout the bar, I inquired whether or not cigar smoking was allowed.  I was informed yes by the bartender.  I took out my Arturo Fuente and lit up.  A few enjoyable puffs and 5 minutes later, I saw the familiar whispering and gesturing.  The bartender came over and told me she was just talking to the owner who said cigar smoking was NOT allowed.  Gee - that's why I asked first.  Interesting that the owner himself didn't come up to me.  \n\nShortly before the band started to play, I asked the bartender to order us some spinach/artichoke dip with chips.  It never arrived.\n\nI grew up listening to Tower of Power and I must say that this tribute band was spot on.  They played all my old favorites over the course of two sets.  I was totally surprised at the lack of people - I counted less than 20.  Despite the fact of the place being so cold inside, this was a totally enjoyable evening.  In my younger years, I used to frequent establishments like this all the time so it brought back some good memories.  I will also be on the lookout for more performances by East Bay Grease.\n\nI noticed slot machines at the bar - but since they don't allow cigar smoking I'll have to gamble elsewhere.

My first impression was that it was a good place to watch sports. I was pleased that they offered Pepsi products and told the bartender that I was the designated driver as I ordered a Diet Pepsi. My friend and I went to one of several open tables.\n\nIt was a typical dive bar with great televisions. The wings were very good and our bartender was very attentive. Sadly, the waitress who came on midway through the first games completely ignored our table. My friend and I had to get our own water. \n\nI was appalled when a man (presumably the owner, who should know better) walked in smoking a cigar. The stench alone was enough to turn my stomach.\n\nI was further appalled when I saw that I had been charged for my soda and the few refills I had. Really?? Very few bars actually penalize the designated driver by even charging for one soda, much less charging that person for refills. At $2.25 each, it would have been cheaper for me to drink beer. If she had been kind enough to tell me that refills were not free, I would have ordered water as a refill. I'm surprised they don't charge for that (and they probably would if they could). I did express my surprise to the bartender and she said she had to follow the rules. Hopefully this review will have the owner revising those rules.\n\nAll in all, I will not go out of my way to go to Sammy's. I know of many other great sports bars (dives and nice pubs) who seem far more appreciative when I spend my money. \n\nHopefully the owner will extinguish his cigar before walking through his pub.

I LOVED the ORIGINAL CHEERS. It was a dive, and what a dive should be. Dirty, cheap, skanky, good music, GREAT bartenders that were personable but also didn't take shit, and also remembered your face and what beer you liked. The bouncers were cool, and if some guy deserved to get his ass kicked they proceeded to take him outside and turn a blind eye if he DESERVED it. The bathrooms were filthy, really disgusting, yet I know plenty of women who have had sex in there, haha, but hey it is what it is. \n\nSo these new owners want to \"clean\" it up. Yeah I guess the original had it's run and it might be nice to spruce this place up. Okay, i'm cool with that. But I have some information for the new owners to help them out a bit....\n\nNew OWNERS, if you want this place to succeed, and not end up late tailgaters (shitty, and smells like vomit), Chilly Bombers (filled with young sluts and bro's), oh and the late SMOKEBOX, oops I ment SKYBOX (deceased, and for many reasons), listen up:\n\n1. Don't alienate the ORIGINAL CHEERS clientele. They were die-hard, they loved THEIR shit hole, mostly because it kept out the rest of the douches that were at the other 3 shit places I just talked about. \n\n2. DON'T RAISE THE PRICES. This isn't Fox n Hound, or Tilted Kilt, both of which suck and their drink prices are way to fucking high. If you want people to come around and stay, make drink prices cheap. So if that means you have to shop around for the lowest prices on your distributors, then do it, you're a bar and it's the most important thing to majority of us out there, next to atmosphere, that we think about as patrons. Nothing more mad me happier then paying $2 for a TALL CAN OF PBR at the ORIGINAL CHEERS. Yeah it's shit beer, but shit beer that cost me $2 for a TALLIE, taste really fucking good!\n\n3. NO COVER, EVER. Covers are gay, don't have them. No one likes them, respects them, and most people try to avoid them. \n\n4. FOOD, If you're going to have food, make it tasty. ORIGINAL CHEERS had amazing wings! Find that recipe and roll that over. \n\n5. EMPLOY cool people, from the NEIGHBORHOOD. ORIGINAL CHEERS was a local neighborhood bar, no pun intended from the tv series, but really it was. So please hire people from around this area that we all might know, because listen that just helps out everyone in the long run. \n\nThat's it for now, if I think of more, i'll add it. \n\nHeed my advice, and  you will be successful, Wish you the best.", "review_stars": 1, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I was very sad to see that my beloved Cheers turned into what it is now.  It is not the same dive as it used to be.  Sure the new bathrooms are amazing - but the  drink prices and food prices are incredibly expensive.  It doesn't have the same coziness on the inside like the old Cheers - infact it's very bland.  Somehow they were able to make it seem smaller than it used to be.  The lights were way too bright - the dart boards are right by tables - so if you were to play, you'd somehow have to squeeze your way in there.  No more shuffleboard.  They didn't know how to set up the inside, so the pool tables also seem to be in an awkward place (where the dart boards used to be).  The bartender didn't acknowledge us when we walked in.  There were maybe 10 people at the most in there, half of which were employees.  The bartender forgot if I ordered a rum and coke, or a rum and diet coke.  How can you forget, when there aren't very many people in there?  Also, when we decided to leave, I said I'd like to close out.  He turned the other way, came back and asked \"do you want to close out?\"  Uhhh, yes that's what I had just said.  The crowd was much older - and I don't think I will be back.

You will notice most of the bad reviews come from previous patrons or maybe workers.  That is how I feel, and they are bias in my view because people do not like change.\n\nSo my real rating from some one who was told about this place. I would give this more of a 3.5 rating cause it better than average for a local bar. Your get a sports bar feel from the pool tables, shuffle boards, sports games playing. Friday night and Saturday night are the \"busy\" nights. They run Karaoke on those nights but I cant fully call it a karaoke bar cause its not ever night.  Only been there one time on a Friday night went by my self cause I enjoy karaoke. I feel its more of a neighborhood bar, its not a dance club and pick up ladies bar. It feels like regulars and some of there friend hanging out enjoying karaoke. Its a great spot for friends to hag out for sure. Song selection was decent give it a 4/5. I am used to having any song I want to sing with my friend who host Karaoke on other nights so I am spoiled. \n\n As far as the service, I was at the karaoke book for about 2-3 min bye the karaoke host station so no waitress noticed me.  That is understandable, I am alone and could be with a group since I was at the host table. I then decided to sit at the bar. The Woman/Bartender did not seem to notice me at first, she was washing dishes for about 1-2 min. Not a big deal, but I feel you should acknowledge the person and say I will be right with you if your gonna continue doing dishes. Then she came over after she was done, she smiled and politely asked what I wanted. I told I wanted my usual Southern Comfort and Sprite. She got it right away. Then asked if I wanted to pay cash or start a tab. I said ill start a tab. Then she asked, \"may I steal a card from you\" I dont like this phrase at all in a professional sense.  Even though I disliked it I was quite and I handed her my card respectfully and she then put the card on the back table with my name I assume attached to it.  Now here is what I dislike the most. I was never told her name there was no introduction it was just what would you like and give me your card pretty much. So I gave her my precious Credit Card and I don't know her. . .I have previous bar tending experience, I feel its like greeting some one for the first time you say hello ask there name and tell them yours and make them feel welcome. A smile and fast service is nice, but a warm welcome and a new friend is better. I honestly feel it was not that busy because it was only like 930ish and maybe 8 people at the bar.  If you want to make new customers and longer patrons my advice is tell them your name say it a couple times so they don't have to yell or scream \"hey Miss\" or \"Hey Bartender\" Cause I know that pissed me off when I worked. I am trying to help these are little things that can make a huge difference in service and repeat customers. So in terms of service I would give it a 2.5/5 totally average nothing special.\n\nSo on the drinks that is what people come out for to get good drinks and food depending. I have too say my first drink was average on pour, the second one tasted like a double. So over all I would say that is good 4/5 easily she knew how to make drinks and was very fast. Not sure if she meant to make the second one stronger but I could see the Dark amber color in mixed with the sprite on the second drink so it was good pour for sure. I only had 2 drinks I had a 9$ tab + 3$tip included I feel the service was decent enough for it it could of been better I do not find great bartenders any more honestly. \n\nSo finally to the Crowd at Cheers. I sang 2 songs both time they clapped and some Women with there Husband or Significant other. Complemented me on how well of a job I did. I know I have a good voice not star material by any means but I love music. The total Crowd was nice and pleasant, other than one gentleman who could of passed off for a hard core biker guy with his leather jacket and tattoos stated' \"How does it feel to be gay.\"  I did not take offence at all I just smiled and said,\" You are not the first to ask if I was gay or even say a comment like that.\" he chuckled \"not the first, really?!?\" Then I stated, \"Being gay is not a bad thing. I am not gay and I feel some women prefer a sensitive type. I sing songs about love or that women appeal to because its a great way to pick them up.\" He laughed and I finished signing my tab I stated, \"enjoy your night sir, maybe you should try and sing too\" and I walked out.

From the look of the \"Asian Bistro\" sign I thought it was going to be like a PF Changs or a Flo's type of place.  However, upon entering, I could see just how wrong I was.  It is a rather large place and very busy on this Wednesday afternoon.  There were probably only 2 or 3 other daring white people there, so I knew this place was legit.\n\nYou walk up to the counter to order kind of like Panda Express in the mall.  You pick a 1, 2, or 3 item combo and they put it on your plate with some rice.  From experience I knew that the 3 item combo would be too much for me to eat, but I ordered it anyway because I wanted to try as much as I could.\n\nI was disappointed that there was no sign describing each of the 12 or so dishes that you could choose from.  Well, if there was, it would probably be in a language that I couldn't understand anyway.  Lets just say I was lucky to have come with 2 Filipino coworkers of mine who acted like guides for me.  I resorted to the \"point to whatever looks good\" method which worked until I pointed to the bopis (lung) and the dinuguan (blood soup).  More on those later though.  Anyway, I picked the adobo, menudo, and some other beef item.\n\nThe beef and the chicken items were good, but I just don't like how they are little pieces that are still on the bone.  I find it difficult to eat and messy.  However, they were very tasty.  My 3rd item was by far the best.  I got the menudo which is more like a beef stew.  Had I known the name of it I probably wouldn't have gotten it because all I had known previously is Mexican menudo and that doesn't interest me.  At any rate it was very good and I would get it again.\n\nNow back to the lung and blood soup.  My coworkers ordered those dishes and of course they made me try them.  I am not going to lie and say that they were terrible because they weren't.  It is just the simple fact that I know what it is and it is way out of my comfort zone so it made my stomach a little weazy.\n\nThe best part of the meal here was dessert.  One of my favorite Filipino desserts is called \"turon\".  It is some sort of banana wrapped in a carmelized wrapper.  All I know is that it is amazing.  My coworkers have brought some to me on several occasions but I just had to have a fresh one right out of the oven.  It was amazing.  They have plenty of other authentic Filipino desserts, but I couldn't resist the turon.\n\nThe establishment isn't overly fancy; there are 10-15 large and small tables, a few couches and other misc. chairs.  I think the place doubles as a karaoke bar at night from what I heard.  Anyway, the food is authentic and the service is friendly, but in the end I think my belly is to \"Americanized\" to dine here on a regular basis.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Asian bistro...a nice little Filipino cuisine restaurant, filled with many authentic pinoy platters.

The food is in trays and you pick what you want.  \n\nI got the 2 picks and knew I wanted adobo, but asked the guy what else is good.  He gave me pancit which looked like lo mein or something.  Then he asked me if I wanted cantaloupe juice.  It took me by surprise when he pointed to this huge vat of orange, icy, slushiness...I stuttered and said \"YEAH!!!\"\nI was about to check out when I saw somebody (I guess one of the owners or family or somethin') putting something in a bowl.  I asked what it was and the heck if I can spell what they said, but it turns out it was some kind of tripe in a white gravy with rice.  Then another guy came and got something that looked awesome as well, which was pork snout.  They gave me a sample of the snout and yeah, the relationship was instant.  Pig nose and me are now friends.\n\nSo I have here in front of me is pancit, chicken adobo, pork snout and cantaloupe juice.  I haven't had such a great meal in a while.

I cannot see myself going without it for more than a week.\n\nThe adobo is tender and juicy.  The pancit is not dry like I thought it would be, and has a great taste.  The pork snout is just amazing...its got a tang to it that I can't really describe, but also can't get enough of.\n\nI can't remember what it all cost me, I didn't care after I sampled the snout.  But I got a lot of change back from a $20, so...unless it was all 1's then its not expensive.\n\nThe people inside were all Filipino and friendly enough to a newcomer.  I've always wanted to connect with my other nationality, and good food is always a great way to do so.  I know I'll be back whenever I can.  And from what I can understand the other side of the place is some kind of entertainment area, and I think one of the other reviewers said its a karaoke thing.

Their sizzling  beef bulalo is 3 out of 5......only because the steak plate it came in was off the shelf-cold and there was no sizzle at all when they served the dish. the meal was good though so i guess that pretty much offsets the lack of SIZZLE in their so-declared SIZZLING bulalo.\nTheir sizzling fish belly (bangus fish) is EXCELLENT.supposed to be a five but again there was no physical sizzle to what they call Sizzling Bangus Fish.\nTheir sizzling BISTEK (beef slices) with onions were GOOD.

Asian Bistro MUST improve their song selection because their song selection is similar to what a lot of Asians have for HOME USE. There were also some problems with the karaoke system.Sometimes the songs had too slow a tempo....sometimes the tempo was too fast......this so seriously needs to be addressed. Their karaoke is on every wednesday and Friday nights.

The staff was welcoming, friendly, and helpful.\n\nThe long:\nLocated in a big shopping center on the southwest corner of 35th Ave. and Dunlap, the place is fairly easy to find (in the northern arm of the center), and there's ample parking. When you walk in, you see a typical turo-turo style eatery. Turo-turo means \"point point,\" and they use the term because the food is set up cafeteria style, all in a steam table, and all you do is point at what you'd like to eat. You can go for a one-, two-. or three-item combo served with two generous scoops of white rice. There's also a short order menu that serves some Filipino classics, including a whole \"silog\" menu--which is food served with eggs, usually for breakfast--and some simple American fare like burgers\n\nThere were some traditional desserts in the pastry case that served the door and about 16 items in the steam table. My boyfriend and I went for broke because I wanted to see how this food compared to the food I grew up with. We tried the pork and chicken adobo (I'd asked only for pork, but the server didn't like that she couldn't fill a whole 12-oz cup with what was left at the end of the night, she so gave us some chicken adobo in consolation), chicken curry, beef mechado (the sauce is similar to cacciatore--tomato based wit bell peppers), beef kabute (beef and mushrooms, similar to beef stroganoff), laing (stewed taro leaves, what I call the collard greens of the Philippines), and dinuguan (pork in pork blood--not for the squeamish!). The owner also asked if we'd like to try the sinigang, which is a tamarind-based fish soup. To drink we had the sago't gulaman and a mango boba. For dessert (although really, the sago't and boba should be considered dessert for those with a normal, not-homesick stomach capacity), we tried the halo-halo special. \n\nTo the point--everything tasted great. If you order on a day your body's really craving protein, you risk suffering death by pork at a turo-turo eatery, and Halo-Halo Kitchen does pork so very well--tender and flavorful. The beef dishes were also well cooked. The curry was pretty standard--the sweeter Japanese style, and the chicken legs in it were also wonderfully tender. The only problems were with the chicken adobo where the sauce was wonderful, but the meat was just a bit dry (you'd think that would be a more common problem in a steam table setup, but because most dishes are stews held at lower temps, the meat stays moist). The laing was more sour than I'm used to--not sure if it was their taro leaves (for the most part, out here, you can only find them frozen or dried), too much fermented shrimp paste (adds a salty, pungent, umami flavor in perfect amounts), or maybe too much patis (fish sauce--adds an earthier layer of the same stuff shrimp paste does), or maybe not enough coconut milk and cream. Regardless, it wasn't bad--just not as sweet as I'm used to. What made the best dishes for me, and what makes Filipino food awesome in my mind, is the sauces. Filipino food is served with rice, and the sauce just soaks into that rice and makes that perfect bite last longer. Because of my choices, we basically ended up with two plates of comfort food, and every bite was definitely comforting. \n\nOur beverages were brought to our table after they were made a few minutes after we sat down, and the halo-halo special came as we finished our dinner. The sago't was good, although the boba grew as the night went on, so sucking it through the straw was crazy. The jelly in the sago't was tasty, though. My boyfriend's mango boba was amazing--at one point, I jokingly suggested they'd just taken some frozen mango and pureed it, but once I said it,  I was halfway convinced that they'd actually done that. The halo-halo special was also awesome. Even though it's considered a summer dessert because it's based on shaved ice, I could eat it year around. It was as good as it gets, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream (it might have been jack fruit ice cream), a generous smear of ube, and a chunk of flat at the top, the sweetened condensed milk soaking into the ice, and the usual halo-halo blend at the bottom (red mung beans, jellies, palm fruit, strips of jack fruit and macapuno, etc.). Halo-halo means \"mix-mix,\" and they set the tall plastic cup up with a dome lid and a long-handled plastic spoon so you could churn everything together into homogenized harmony. \n\nThe lady at the counter told us the turo-turo menu changes every day, so I'm looking forward to going back and trying their other food, along with all the other food we didn't have room to try.

Crispy, yet not too deep fried.  Very good egg rolls though.\n\nHalo Halo - a Filipino dessert with shaved ice, condensed milk, red bean, canned fruit, ube (sweet purple yam), and ice cream.  They do a decent job.  However, from my perspective, I don't think I have ever had a bad Halo Halo, as most taste the same to me.\n\nTuron - a deep fried plantain banana.  Need I say more?  Okay, well it has a great caramelize coat around it with the crunch biting into a sweet plantain banana.  And BAM!

I have had it serval times sence, each time it was different, but just as good and comforting.   There has been times the Filipino server informed me I didn't want that, I would not like it.  This is why, not the pork blood base but the organ meat (offal) and the miscellaneous tidbits or trimmings that was part of it.  It was not made with the best parts, but the leftover parts.  Some times it was a mildly spicy, that is the regional and cooks preference, never hot or more then mildly spicy.  As I had it in the past it had all kinds of notes or tastes, do to all the different bets that went into it.\n\nSadly, regrettably, and a statement on the narrow minded, American Eaters, in order to serve to \"the American\" customer (to stay in business), this wonderful dish has been turned into a good but 2 note meal.  They use standard pork, one note, the sauce note 2, rice is the binder the same as FOFO, bread, and other starchy foods.   \n\nI pity all those that will not even try anything other then Midwest American washed foods.

Decatur Blvd.  Pulling into the lot, I recall seeing this place on yelp and was anxious to get my turn at it.  It's pretty crowded for a late Friday night and people are starting to pile in.\n\nWe join the line and perused the menu above.  The BF convinces me to go for the Hawaiian Plate at $8.99.  It's Kalua Pig and Pork Lau Lau, so this way he gets to try some of the kalua pig too!  This comes with two scoops of rice and one scoop of mac salad.  The BF ops for the Kalbi Combo at $7.99.  This give us Kalbi, Katsu, and Chicken Teriyaki.  It also comes with the standard two scoops of white rice and one scoop of mac salad.  \n\nI should mention, I've been to my share of Hawaiian joints, but my sister takes the cake.  She definitely makes it a point to try out any new ones that she comes across.  She also always substitutes the two scoops of rice and one scoop of mac salad for an additional scoop of mac and one less rice.  This is usually never a problem, and if anything, they might charge a bit more for the mac salad.  Well, I asked if I could do this.  The cashier had to ask another woman, and she in turn had to ask another guy (the manager/owner) I assume.  He flat out said no.  Wow.  They tried explaining something about not charging me for the rice, so they can't do that.  Anyway, I think I was just put off with the whole \"No.\" answer.  They could have said yes and said they would charge me for the substitution, which I probably would have agreed to anyway.  \n\nWe got our number, helped ourselves to beverages and condiments and took a seat in a booth.  One of the servers soon headed our way with my order.  Just as she was about to place it on the table, all this liquid came spilling out onto the floor and table from the plate.  (Wtf?)  She apologized and went to retrieve a towel to clean up the mess.  I was fine with the spill and clean up, my concern was with where all the liquid came from?!  I guess my Pork Lau Lau must have come out a bath, because that was dripping wet.  I ended up  pouring all this additional liquid off my plate into another plate before my rice and mac salad got too soggy from all this 'juice' sitting on my dish.  I unraveled my lau lau in search of my pork and took my first bite.  For being soggy, the meat was rather tough and the whole dish had no taste.  I ended up pouring tons of shoyu all over the dish.  There was no fatty bits either to give it any flavor.  Very disappointing on the pork lau lau part.  The kalua pig faired a bit better, but not by much.  It started out well, but as I got deeper into it, there was a lot of tough pieces that I ended up spitting out.  Overall, my dish was pretty disappointing.  I wouldn't go back here for any pork lau lau at all.\n\nI was about halfway through my order before the BF's order finally arrived.  (This is never a good thing.)  His was better, in his opinion.  He had a decent experience with his order at least.  The Chicken Teriyaki had a sweeter sauce than what I'm used to, but that's probably why this dish does well here. \n\nThe mac salad was better than some of the other places I've been to, so that was a good thing.  \n\nThere's the Aloha Bar next door and there's karaoke on Friday nights.  You'll see the servers bringing orders in next door if you're dining in.  \n\nThey do offer delivery, it's a $10 minimum and if you get their flyer, you'll find a 15% coupon on there. I asked if they had any business cards, which they were out of.  When the cashier asked the manager/owner if he had any, he asked \"Why?\"  (Uh, 'cuz I'm going to yelp this place, that's why!)\n\nWhen it comes down to it, Aloha Kitchen will continue to do well.  They are open later than some of the other Hawaiian establishments around town (5 am on Fridays and Saturdays I believe!) and they have a surplus of young customers coming in to chow down.

There was nothing really special about it. It was just rice inside an omelet. In fact, the rice itself was bland and dry. There was nothing about that dish that resembled Adobo other than the brown color of the rice, which I repeat, was bland and dry. To put it bluntly, that Omelet sucked balls. It was kind of hard to face our friends and give them a fake smile and say, \"Oh that shit was bomb! We're definitely going back to have another one when we come back again.\" \n\nIn all honesty, we would have been better off just ordering the Chicken Katsu or Loco Moco.

The flavors of the adobo sauce are immediately evident, the savory soy sauce, tangy vinegar and the garlic are present in every bite, with the egg adding an additional texture to contrast the rice and chicken.  Oh, and this thing is BIG.  I don't think I've ever eaten a whole omelet in one sitting.  I usually save half for later or share with a friend.  I imagine I could defeat the beast if I focused on it, but I'm usually too hungover or too concerned about the buffet that is to follow later in the day to ever attempt the feat.\n\nIf you like adobo, you need to try the adobo fried rice omelet!\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Filipino-style adobo:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobo#Filipino_adobo\n\nI've also sampled the lumpia (think Filipino-style eggrolls) and the turon (dessert lumpia with banana and jackfruit) and liked them both, but our motto in Vegas has become \"eyes on the prize!\"  All we get now is the omelet.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I just need something heavy and comforting to sop up some drinks I had and some adobo omelette sounded good.\n\nThe BF and I shared:\n\nAdobo Omelette- pretty good and quite large and filling.

Where do I begin..  I saw their advertisement for about 2 weeks for their xmas day buffet for $15.  The list of food sounded great and included many typical hawaiian items.  I arrived there around 7.  It was fairly quiet/empty and figured most people came there earlier. There were probably only 20 people in there when I arrived.  \n1st off the service was great. The employees were very nice and I definitely expected that being in a hawiian restaurant.  The place was also very clean and that too was not an issue.  \n\nThe food is the main issue here.  When I walked upto the buffet, the sushi table had 3 basic rolls on there and was ok at best.  The lumpia was probably the most decent thing I ate.  I was in total shock when I saw the spam musubi.  They had it all nice looking, all cut in half in nice big pieces (this would've been perfect but NOOOO they screwed it up.) They had some sort of sauce on ALL of it. The problem is you CAN'T put sauce on a rice item like this that is sitting there.  I had one bite and it completely fell apart in my hand because the sauce had made the whole thing mushy.  \n\nThe katsu was overcooked and dried out.  The halfway decent stir fry veggies were sorta ok but they were sitting under a heat lamp and getting mushy and all in all lacked flavor.  The curry was very bland. I tried a little of a few other dishes and again everything was bland and blah.  I was completely disappointed in the macaroni salad. WOW it had nooooo flavor to it. It was just simply mayonaisse.  \n\nThe desserts were store bought donuts, some chocolate chip cookies, and some funky brownies.  and btw I saw other people sitting around me making faces too about the food. \n\nThere's a few problems here. #1 let's compare apples to apples... Aloha kitchen vs L&L Hawaiian. This buffet gave me a really good idea of what their food is like if I ordered it off their regular menu (vs buffet style) I have been to L&L many many times and wow they are definitely a LOT better then Aloha.  I have tried several things on their menu and everything has been flavorful, yummy, not over cooked and their macaroni salad is great too.   1 out of 10.. Aloha you're a 1.  L&L a 10.\nThere was nothing good about the food at Aloha and I was VERY disappointed.  Now comparison #2.  Although now I'm comparing apples to oranges but still.  \n\nAloha vs buffet @ asia which is just minutes up the street.  Aloha, you can not charge $15 for what you put on that buffet with that kind of quality.  Buffet @ Asia is WAY better then you in quality and selection for the same price.  Just sushi alone puts you to shame (and they don't have any fantastic sushi either but it's way better then yours)  and with Sushi Mon being 10 min up the street as well, they blow both places out of the water.  \n\nIt's very tough to run a good restaurant, but if L&L can have almost all the same menu items and they do it right with quality, and taste and the same price, then so can you.

No place is far though, when you're on a local food fix!\n\nLast night I had one of those cravings, so I came by to visit everyone at Aloha Kitchen.  I've been to this location many times because of the karaoke bar next door.  Everyone is AH-MAZE-ING.  First off, you're greeted by their bouncer, Greg.  Then you have Shawn at the bar.  Probably the coolest guy you'll ever meet.  Jovane (sorry if I misspelled your name) was the cocktail server and super sweet and Izzy is the KJ.  Very entertaining.  In the restaurant, there's Cyndel who's been a part of Aloha Kitchen for over 10 years.  Everyone's just full of Aloha and treats you like family.\n\nTonight I got the chicken katsu, spam musubi and the Shanghai lumpia.  The katsu is super crispy and good.  What I really like though, is the katsu sauce. Best katsu sauce I've had.  It's more tangy and savory, rather than sweet.  To me, it compliments the katsu very well.  With the musubi, they add their teriyaki sauce to the spam so it flavors the rice.  Packed with a lot of flavor.  The lumpia is small and filled with pork.  Served with a sweet chili dipping sauce.  Super good with a beer next door.  \n\nOne thing that I could do without is the constant fighting this place has on late nights.  Lately though, there hasn't been any sketchy activities.

The marinade was nothing special... pretty much what I expected which was overly sweet with not much of a complexity of flavoring agents.  The meat itself was probably the thinnest cut of short ribs I have ever seen.  Even L&L serves up a thicker slab.\n\nKatsu - This was actually pretty good.  Tender and juicy interior with a super crispy and light exterior.  Unfortunately I was not diggin' the dipping sauce.. it just tasted like hoisin mixed with oyster sauce.\n\nChicken Teriyaki - The teriyaki sauce is horrible.  It was thickened with so much cornstarch that it didn't have much flavor.  \n\nAdobo Omelette -  Don't know what everyone is raving about.  Imagine leftover adobo that mom made from the night before, which was fried with some leftover rice the next morning, then wrapped in a blanket of the flattest scrambled eggs I have ever sunken my teeth into.  I mean don't get me wrong, it definitely has that \"homemade\" and \"comfort food\" spot we all have, but please do not go out of your way just to make this purchase.\n\nMac Salad - Typical island mac.. peppery, sweet, & mayo-y.\n\nRice - Super sticky to the point where the rice balls on my plate were a congealed mass of mush.\n\nSpam Musubi - Well, you can't mess up spam, but you can mess up the complimenting sauce and well, the sauce that was slathered between the spam and the rice did the spam musubi no justice.\n\nOVERALL:  Not worth another penny from my wallet.  Maybe it would've been better if it were drunk food.  Also, the people that work here weren't very friendly.

The hamburger meat was dry and the gravy was lacking much flavor. My boyfriend loves loco moco, but he wasn't happy with this version. I've came to the conclusion that I'm just not a fan of loco moco in general. I suppose I've just never had one that blew my tastebuds away. It's typically pretty bland with no real explosion or layers of flavor. I also can't get past the weird cornstarch gravy consistency. 2/5\n\nThe chicken katsu plate $7.69, came with a generous portion of fried chicken with 2 scoops of rice, one scoop of macaroni salad and a side of katsu sauce. The chicken was super crispy and fried to a dark golden brown (no it didn't taste burned), it was actually pretty moist inside. I've had better katsu sauce, but it wasn't bad - it was simple and does the job. Other than that, I didn't have any real complaints with this dish. A great price for what you get. Just make sure you're prepared for the food coma afterwards, it settles like a brick in your stomach. 4/5\n\nThe mac salad was simple, (just tatsted like mayo) but I enjoyed it.

Perfect! 4/5\n\nThe spam musubi $1.99, was about the length of a dollar bill and had a thin slice of spam (didn't even fill the length of the musubi), some sweet gravy-like-sauce, and a brick of rice held together by seaweed.

The chicarron was decent, but I prefer smaller cuts so you get better crisp to the fatty center ratio. The sisig is fairly decent. I think maybe we should have ordered a bit differently only because it was greasy pork bits overload, specially since I was just at a taco crawl event earlier. \n\nThey had live entertainment, a band and a DJ during their intermissions. There is a stage if you want to dance. My biggest complaint was the volume. We left after a bit because we could not hold any conversation. I tried and ended up a bit hoarse and gave up. There is a happy medium as I've been to bar hangouts where a seat in the back meant you can have both. Most of the people really into it anyways will be dancing, right in front of the band so you don't need it to blare. \n\nJust a note that they offer happy hour specials daily of 50% off appetizers and $5 drink specials (7-10pm) but do not while there is live entertainment.

No one was really in there and, yet, it took the host about 5 minutes to notice us (even tho she was 10 feet from us at the bar). After seating us, I immediately ordered the bangsilog (I was starving!) and he ordered tapsilog. We loved it. Large portion of garlic fried rice with crispy garlic chips on top.

The bartender was nice enough to bring out a makeshift/party table onto the dancefloor for us. He kept apologizing, as well, for the lack of immediate service....He kept saying that they were understaffed.

The nachos, obvi, had cheese on it and it was a weird thought but, didn't taste too bad. \nMy friend loved his eggplant torta, more so, after dipping it in his banana ketchup.\nChicken wings were whatever. \nOverall, everyone was satisfied with this visit.

Pancit is a no brainer and can't go wrong.\nSteller stand out was when my roomie ordered chicken skin and fried rice. UGH.

Just as everyone likes.  Flat screens-a-plenty.  High-Definition standard.  And the premier TV is a giant featuring the game everyone wants to see.  NFL Sunday Ticket, ESPN Game Plan, ESPN Full Court, Big Ten Network, MLB Extra Innings, NBA League Pass, Mega March Madness.  You name it, theyve got it.  Within the first few moments when I stepped in, I saw someone flop the nuts at the Main Event WSOP.   Speaking of - Poker Night is hosted every Tuesday.  Also for the musically inclined, theres a Rock Band & Karaoke night staged later in the week.\n\nHappy Hour specials offer many discounts.  And during any football game, its nice to know these specials are always honored.  The menu fare - order any entree and you wont leave hungry.  I recommend the bacon avacado cheeseburger.  The drinks.  You will find many beers on tap, all the spirits, and wine.  And my greatest sense of comfort with Dark Horse is when I go into my favorite bar & ask for \"the usual\" - they know what I want!\n\nMy only complaint about the bar, is there is no Ms. Pac-Man tabletop console.

Yes, we were there for karaoke, but more on that later. This place only had two bartenders working, again, on a busy Friday night, So after waiting several, several minutes my buddy gave up waiting for a waitress and went up to the bar to get us a couple of cold ones.

It's not that big of a deal but sure does make you feel a little second class.\n\nAnd now for the karaoke. Now let me say this: the guy has a big list of songs, no doubt about it. But the age old adage of \"quality vs. quantity\" comes into play here. The most recent song I could find in the book was a Weezer song - from the blue album. And don't get me wrong; I likes me some varietay. It's just that I personally have more fun singing some modern rock tunes.

Puts that other place to shame.\n\nTortillas: made fresh in house and I prefer the corn slightly over the flour.\n\nRice and Beans: way above average and we finished them.\n\nGuacamole: excellent.\n\nWe really enjoyed both meals here. The beer (Bohemia, YES!) was ice cold as were the mugs. Our server was outstanding and very attentive.\n\nI do wish they would upgrade their Margarita program; more top-shelf and craft options available straight up or on the rocks would be nice. We want this place to stay around for many years so more advertising and promotions would be a plus.\n\nIf you think Lindo Michoacan is good, try Hacienda del Rey and see what you have been missing. GO NOW! Hope they can overcome that somewhat jinxed location.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Passed this restaurant a thousand times on my way too and from work, finally decided to stop in and am so glad I did.

It's located on the second floor of the Pacific Asian Plaza.  They have a bunch of random Asian dishes that are meant to be shared with friends over a few drinks.  \n\nTheir specialty though is their fried chicken deep fried in olive oil!  As a result, we had to try it!  We got the Leg and Thigh Special, 5 pieces for $7.95.  It came with a basic cabbage salad with Thousand Island-like dressing and a side order of pickled daikon.  The BF is the connoisseur on fried chicken and he thought it was pretty good.\n\nWe also got the Sweet Rice Crust Soup with Seafood for $17.99.  It's good enough for about four people to have a small bowl each.  The waiter will come with a big bowl of about four to five rectangular pieces of rice crust.  And then he'll pour the thick soup (more like gravy than broth) onto the rice crust.  It's filled with octopus, calamari, and veggies.  Pretty tasty and the rice stays crispy because the soup is so thick.  (There's a Chinese version called sizzling rice soup, except that soup is more broth-like and the rice may not be in rectangles.)\n\nWe didn't get any kind of bowl to grind our own sesame seeds like lena d. or Mike C., so maybe that's only if you order the katsu, which we didn't.  And we also came for dinner which I think is a different experience too.\n\nI'd definitely want to return to try out their other Korean goodies, but I would prefer going with a larger group so you can order more stuff.

It was lightly battered, crisp and came out piping hot. It wasn't very greasy like most joints so that was definitely a plus. They serve the order of chicken with small banchans of sweet picked daikon radish, cabbage kimchee (we had 4 orders at our table of the special and only 2 got kimchee?), and a \"slaw\" of thin cabbage with a thousand island-esque dressing.  I shared one of these with my buddy Nins and needless to say we gobbled it up and I know that bitch was eying the last piece hoping I'd say I didn't want more! LOL  All went very well with it, but I was talking with Nins and seem to agree that maybe we should have gotten a side of something (Rice! Yeah I'm totally \"Filipino\" in this sense!)  or some sauce to break up the dense chicken flavor in my mouth. Again, we gobbled so lack of sauce or another side didn't stop us from enjoying though it could be even better. Will ask for sauce and rice next time.

Later we found out card machines were down....if maybe some of us were told earlier some people could have mustered cash and gone on their way or at the very least let people know what's the situation to keep people patient. Also some of our late comers ordered food and was first sitting on a separate table, as other people left we moved their empty plates to their original table to make room for them to sit with the leftover group. Because of the empty plates on their original table, they didn't get food since they thought they already got food and ate it. Err...well the order was put in so something should have came out so where did their chicken go? The server though was very apologetic about everything and tried very hard to make things right. Even made some fries and taters while our compadres waited on their forgotten chicken order. \n\nMy chicken was a 4, the service was attentive in serving/checking in and tried very hard so even though there was some major in house mistakes that normally would be a no go, I can appreciate a place that tries their hardest to make it right.

I know they are under new management and I am not quite sure how recently that happen so they very well can be still smoothing out the kinks.  I had trouble figuring out what star rating to give it, but after some thought I think 3 is fair. It was an OK night based on what went on. \n\nStill, I think this place is a interesting environment (please look at he bathrooms and make sure to READ the song lyrics/ text on them- hilarious and very random song choice are meshed into the art!) and has some adventurous plates that are a must do very soon as well as a solid \"Bazic\" with their fried chicken goodness (now if only they had waffles I would DIE).\n\n I will be back soon with the BF since he would like to try the chicken, but after much thought...I'm going to do this CASH only and wait a while.

To not communicate with all us that the cards are down and then proceed to write everyones credit card numbers to do it later is very unprofessional even if the intentions weren't shady. Sorry, but even though that didn't happen to my card these are all the people I am with. Now I understand why Matthew C wanted to burn the place. I also forgot that one Yelper went off with their card thinking it was paid for and left and later we were told he hasn't paid. Angela had to call him to figure out if they were pulling something sneaky on us. It was very weird that now they were able to swipe Angelas card just fine to pay for Joe's bill when a few minutes ago it wasn't working for the other Yelpers. \n\nWhatever was going on, it wasn't handled/communicated well and that's the bottom line.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 6, "cool": 5}}, {"text": "I managed to crash a Vegas UYE while in town.

After the wonderful Fremont Street Experience, we knew there would be some Yelping madness we would want to engage in after Midnight.   But after that crazy fantastic time, we indeed wondered if we would have any \"juice\" left to manage this task as we planned to attack the early morning (Midnight - 3AM) with renewed vigor!!\n\nSETUP\n\nOrganized by our very own Seattle Yelper Clover A., this proved to be a good location to have a \"meet-up\" with Yelpers from different cities.  [First we had to get there!  LIMO RIDE:  While at Fremont Street Experience, we went by the Golden Nugget, and there was a bored limo driver who looked at our crazy group and decided then and there that he wanted to be part of our madness.  We had to get to Bazic QUICK for set-up, and so we negotiated with him, and he shot us over to our Korean Karaoke Bar destination in no time.]\n\nBAZIC ROOMS\n\nIf you are familiar with the Rock Box in Seattle or Rurulala in Sacramento, it is a very similar set-up.  Big rooms.  Nice physical plant layout of couches and sectionals.  Good serviceable equipment.  It had the potential to be Karaoke at it's very best.  \n\nKARAOKE BOOKS & EQUIPMENT\n\nHowever, the books were JUST in Korean!  There were some English-language inserted pages, but that was an obvious afterthought.  In addition, we were somewhat limited in our selections it would have appeared, but we did manage (for the most part) with those selection of English-language songs in the narrow band of yellow and green pages.  \n\nAnd then there was the tech itself - such as the controls - which was all overlaid in Korean language and no English to be found.  Made it difficult for us to read the stereo & equipment controls and it did become a nuisance to have one of the guys come and adjust/modify sound levels, feedback, distortion-issues whenever they did arise instead of being able to take care of the issue ourselves.\n\nMY PERSONAL FAVES\n\nI got to belt out my Def Leppard and Linkin Park Standards, so I was dam happy.  I even smoothed out the end of the evening (er, morning) with the Beatles \"Michelle\", so it was all good.\n\nTHE FOOD & DRINK\n\nThere was an ample supply of all kinds of chicken appetizers, beer and sake to keep our energy up, so no complaints in this department.  There were also some sweet-potato fries which were powdered with sugar so that they were sweet, and not savory the way I prefer them.  Ah well.  I still ate them and enjoyed them because I haven't met a sweet potato fry I do not like.\n\nPRICING\n\nInteresting to say the least:  unlike the Karaoke I hit in Sacramento, San Francisco, and Seattle, this establishment has a sliding-mechanism that takes into account the consumables factor.  If it was just Karaoke, the room rental was $40 per hour.  However, if we consumed more than $100 in drinks & food, then the room rental would go down to $20 per hour.  Since there was a group of about 14 of us, and we were there from 11am to 3am, we made sure to get more than $100 in consumables that we would probably have gotten anyways, but Clover and I did buy drinks at the end to \"get us over\" that last bump to $100 so we could default the hourly rate down to $20 an hour.  [Note to self:  I HATE doing math when I'm trying to concentrate on singing!]\n\nKARAOKE CABBIES!\n\nNow this was different: it was 3AM at the end of our stint, so this place does something interesting for it's customers - the servers / chefs double as cabbies!  SERIOUSLY!  Since we are \"quite a way into\" Chinatown-Vegas, it would take a while to get a cab out there.  However, two of the establishments associates got two vehicles:  one to take part of our group back to PLATINUM, and another to take my group back to STRATOSPHERE.  A total win!\n\nTHE LOWDOWN\n\nAll-in-all, a good experience.  I don't like to nit-pick the little things, and also have great respect for cultural traditions and cultural business-choices.\n\nHOWEVER, given this establishment wants to do business with a mainstream English-speaking demographic (it's in Vegas, USA, after all), and given that one could reasonably expect that there would be a preference for more mainstream English-language music by a significant customer base of English-speakers, I'm just saying it would be prudent (as a BUSINESS owner or BUSINESS manager, etc.) to make sure to supply better books and readable tech that is readible in English.  \n\nIf on the other hand, the point is to discourage English-speaking patrons from coming here to enjoy Karaoke, then don't change a thing.  Frustrated customers just won't return.  However, we hardcore Karaokers will find a way to manage, even if a bit more grumpily.\n\nAll-in-all, a 3-STAR experience.

Tasty but not high in quantity. They put some kind of salt in there that makes me want to order seconds if not thirds. I have also tried the Kimchi(ish) pizza.

Can't remember the price but, it wasn't crazy expensive.  The food on the other hand wasn't the greatest.  Some of the food on the menu wasn't available which sucked because based off of the reviews on Yelp it looked delicious.  We ended up getting French fries and these deep fried chicken niblets that were coated in Korean sauce.  Luckily I was a little tipsy and more into the singing but, the fries were okay and the niblets could have been better if they didn't come to us cold.\n\n  But, I can't knock the service.  There was a bell we can ring on the door whenever we needed something and the wait was never to long.  As for the song selection it was up to par.  Usually found what we wanted but, I'd say half of the song selection was written in Korean and the other half was English which was limiting.  Oh yeah, the tambourine!  For those that maybe shy to sing, they have a tambourine that looked like it was from the Electronic Daisy Carnival.  More cow.....Tambourine?  \n\nThe bath rooms were really funny.  The men's bathroom walls were painted with skanky  anime chicks that were half naked.  Eh, can't hate that.  My wife had said that the woman's bathrooms had the same but male cartoons.  \n\nOverall, the night was quirky and super fun, especially after having a bunch to drink.  We ended up with a pretty high bill and for that reason I'll give this place 3 stars.

There ain't no seats open so the host guy tells us that we have to wait approximately 5 minutes. I was like \"NO F*CKING WAY! 5 minutes? I don't got the patience for that!\". So we walk up to this random Korean couple and nicely told them to \"get the f*ck out or I will knock the kimchee out of your f*cking mouth!\" Even though the chick at the table quickly got up and ran out the door, Ife still thought it was a good idea to punch her in this face and poor her Soju all over her head. So, with that problem out of the way we got a pretty good seat. We got into another fight with the staff when it literally took like 2 whole minutes for our server to get to us.  What kind of slow ass service is that? Obviously, the server didn't know he was dealing with very wealthy and sophisticated people here. We told him to do the Gangnam Style dance or we wouldn't tip him. Eventually I waved a $1 bill in front of his face and he gave in and started dancing. Just to be nice, I threw his tip off the balcony where he ran for it, down the stairs, as fast as he could. Unfortunately, the Chinese girls at Shuseki had already gotten to it before he could get down there. Seeing how i'm one of those people who love to drink and get wasted, I ordered like 3 bottles of that Orange Soju stuff. At the end of the night, the service was still so bad that we did not pay the check and just walked out. In the parking lot, I decided to use my skillful \"womanizing\" techniques on Ife and I was like: \"Hey bitch! I am totally good at the sex and gonna like totally do the sexing on you!\" That line usually works on every chick at Lewis Family Park, and I just don't understand why it didn't work on her. She gave me a beating that was worse than anything I had experienced during my boxing days. While I was completely lifeless on the floor, she took my keys and drove off in the 1992 honda civic that my dad bought me for my 25th birthday. As I was laying on the cold asphalt of the parking lot, I had started crying because I realized my pokemon card collection was still in the backseat, and also I was Forever Alone...\n\nNone of that story above happened. \n\nThe real story was that due to the superbowl crowd and all the other sh!t going on Saturday night in Las Vegas, we literally were having a disasterific night and just needed a place to hang out. I hadn't slept in 3 days, and was so incoherent and zombified. The conversations I was having with Ife were so awkward and strange. My words were slurring and my personality was totally loserific. We found Bazic because of a review that Tien had written. Ife loves K-pop and Korean culture so we thought it might be a fun place to hang out. When we walked in, no one assumed I was Korean. I took too much after my Japanese side, and none of the servers in a million years thought I was even 1% Korean. Our server was actually really great, and I tipped quite a bit. Ife ordered this giant bottle of Orange Soju which didn't even come close to getting her buzzed, while all the other people in the club who ordered it were totally on the floor, puking their brains out. Ife is so f*cking rad! She can literally outdrink the country of Ireland. I on the other hand, being Straight Edge was sitting there and thinking to myself \"I wish I had a coke\". And then suddenly the server brought me one of those fancy ass cokes from the metal bottle. It was the happiest day of my life. Overall, it was a really great experience! Next time I'm gonna rent one of those Karoake things and invite all my yelp friends.  Can't wait to hang out with Ife again, we are going to that Commonworld(spelling ?) UYE event on Wednesday.

I couldn't understand why, they have absolutely invested so much profit into making this place so excellent I don't understand how anyone wouldn't want to come back. The location also isn't too hidden in my opinion as well. \n\nDuring my stay, I didn't try any korean liquor but they definitely have some if anyone is looking to take a chance. I've remained relatively sober so I stuck with the food they served instead. I remembered that I chose some sort of korean barbeque beef along with rice and it was sweet and excellently done. They also provided me with free kimchi to go along with it. Keep in mind though, you probably need above 10 dollars to try one of their authentic dishes unless you are only going for the appetizers. Special high end alcohol is also quite expensive, but if you are looking to stick with beer, wine, or a shot of whisky, you are in good company.  \n\nI see a bright future for this place, it should get better with more available customers, and it will probably be one of my local hubs when I need to chill after work/school at night.

While it was something different, and of course I wasn't expecting it to be or taste like authentic Korean food, some more bulgogi on it would have made it a little less forgettable. The pork cutlet was pounded extremely thin and heavily breaded.

First off, Jamie showed us the Karaoke rooms each ranging in size and cost per hour. They were all complete with their own large flat screen monitor, microphones and songbook .  Prices began at $60 on up.

I liked it, but I had to see the robot toilet!  Jamie laughed when I asked and took us all immediately to the john where she, without hesitation, went right up to the commode and pointed out the various features on the wall next to the TP.  It was rather uncomfortable for me looking at a public toilet and hearing this very pretty woman talk about how you can make the seat warm up so your behind would not be shocked with coldness when in need to drop the kids off at the pool.  I am even uncomfortable now, just writing about it.  The porcelain throne did some other bizarre things- but I had left the room as quickly as possible back into the bar looking for a drink.\nJamie set us up at a table along the perimeter.  Samples of Stevie Nicks, Pat Benatar, Yes, Billy Squire and even Neil Diamond rolled out over the pulsing beats.  Very strange but I liked it.  Within minutes of being seated my 2 friends (straight) and I  (not straight) noted the higher numbers of well dressed men that seemed to cluster amongst themselves without any inclusion of a female.

On a recent visit into town I came here for happy hour and it was a good time!!! \n\nIf you like sushi & sake happy hours, this is the place for you!!! They have a good selection of half prices appetizers (I'd say about 15 different selections ranging from $3-5 during happy hour) & sushi. Unlike a lot of sushi happy hours, which typically only offer California, tuna, and Philly rolls during happy hour, this place also offers yellow tail, Caterpillar, & rainbow rolls amongst several others (and \"spicy\" versions of a lot of these). The sushi is above average and worth the $3-5 that most rolls cost during happy hour. \n\nEnough about the food though!!! This IS happy hour after all, so it's the alcohol you want to hear about!!!! Well, the group I started off with wanted to sample the infused sake Geisha offers during happy hour, which includes strawberry, apple, pomegranate, and mango. We tried all of them except the strawberry. The apple was a little watered down but the mango and pomegranate were both good. These were $4 each during happy hour for about 4 or 5 sake glasses worth for each.  Next up were sake bombers!!! Three dollar Sapporo's and I think $2 for sake. They also offer specialty cocktails during happy hour, which I didn't try, but apparently they've changed a little from when Geisha first started happy hour. \n\nThe night we were there we had about 10 people in our group. I wish I could remember our waitress's name, but she did a good job handling us. She had no problem dividing up bills, and didn't give the evil eye when a few people complained about drinks. She just switched them out no questions asked. \n\nLike I said, if you like happy hour sushi & sake, you'll like this place!!! Happy hour runs from 4-7. Since I was visiting from out of town and a couple people I came with got off work early we showed up shortly after it started.

I'm sure it was still strong, but the sweetness balanced it out perfectly.\n\nI also had the Hello Kitty (usually $10, at happy hour $5), which you just can't go wrong with.

We almost always sit on the patio since the inside is so dark that I'm afraid I might wind up in the wrong bathroom. The karaoke rooms are nice, although intimidating as you are being led down a dark hallway to a room in which your companions will most certainly make fun of you. Depending on your group size, 5 could fit comfortably in the smaller room whereas 8 is pushing the limits (imagine spilled drinks and dropped sushi). They larger room is intended for 10 - 15 and is pretty spacious.

Then, we normally order the dragon roll. Their sushi is good, standard for the most part, but the specialty rolls have some pretty cracked out names. One of our favorites is the Gaijin - a chimichanga styled sushi roll, deep fried and delicious with cream cheese and avocado. We haven't ventured much into the other areas of their menu - salads, noodles, etc. The green tea gelato is good, but we've had better that tasted less freeze burnt.

Geisha's menu does reach for eccentricity (they have a roll with Fritos on it in case you are pregnant or high), but most rolls wash out the unique flavors and land as bland on the palate. The only item of truly low quality is the gyoza, as it is consistently undercooked.\n\nI wouldn't recommend Geisha outside of happy hour, as it isn't good enough to justify full pricing; however, it is so cheap during happy hour, that the shortcomings vanish with the dollar signs.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Great happy hour pricing and food. \nMake sure your entire party is present or they won't seat you.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Happy hour-amazing!!!
