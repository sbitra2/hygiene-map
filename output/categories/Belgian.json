I was pleasantly surprised when I entered to find an adorable, well-lit, almost romantic establishment serving some pretty tasty food.   Our server was very helpful in aiding us through the list of beers -- as my dining companion wasn't really a fan of beer in general. (and we successfully found one that both of us enjoyed)  The bread is served with a seasonal herb butter -- it was green and oh so delicious.  I had the house special mussels and frites.  I was a little disappointed that I had to shell my own mussels, but the work was well worth it.  My dining companion had the steak and frites. She described the steak as tender and enjoyed every morsel of it.  \nThe restaurant is small, I am not sure if I would ever bring a group of people here.. however it would be a great place for a date or a double date.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Visiting the Brasserie V after about 2 weeks after its opening, and then about 2 months later, one word jumped into my head immediately.  Inconsistent.\n\nThe service and especially the food wavered in quality and delivery.  Starting with the first visit, I was taken as a surprise with the place still in its infancy, mellow, feeling as if word of its existence hadn't really gotten out yet.  Upon returning those several months later the place had become lit darker, much louder (due to the fact it was packed) and complete with a long wait as there are few tables.\n\nNow I'm not one to complain about noise, nor about having to wait, but it is truly loud inside for a small restaurant, and if your host informs you its only a fifteen minute wait and it turns out to be more around double don't continually string them along telling them, \"Just a few more minutes.\"  Recall what you told those waiting and address the fact you were mistaken, otherwise gauge more time than you think it will take.  Telling groups their wait time is low, only for it to be over double starts a sour note before menus are even in hand.  Unfortunately, the minimal wait space inside does little to help those table-less.\n\nOkay, now before I begin spilling out one of those prototypical long tirades complaining about rude wait staff, undercooked orders, and long wait times perhaps the best way for me to reflect may this tried and true form.\n\nThe Good: Their more affordably charged sandwiches were the highlight item each time, I recommend the one with mustard.  I actually don't like mustard but this was very rich without being overbearing, very close to amazing.  A very nice Belgian beer selection, although a bit expensive, one of these won't kill you, and if the place isn't completely  jammed and the bald man at the bar is feeling nice he can help point you in the right direction if you're feeling overwhelmed.  \n\nThe Bad: The much hyped frites are simply thinly cut fries, slice and dice it how you will, because sliced and diced they are still fried potatoes and not a lot more.  The tri cups of dipping sauce that accompany seem to exist to enliven these knowingly dull snacks but they should be more flavorful or evolved.  Besides the above mentioned wait-times, the servers seemed very distant and non-communicative, while not rude, when in a loud restaurant the server should assert themselves over the noise letting you know you're of value and you're noticed.  Sometimes when feeling swallowed up the lack of server presence is much more estranging than typically felt.\n\nThe Ugly:  Upon both visits, the lamb was ordered and requested beforehand to be cooked more than rare.  Both times returning marginally more than rare, causing two send backs the second time.  Above all, get the meat cooking instructions correct.  For whatever reason of confusion, this looks extremely unprofessional. \n\nI'm going to give the Brasserie a pass here, in memory of the better food and experience I had the first time and hope that as time goes by they can tighten up some of these hitches.  You can see the potential for it to really sail and just soar but for the ambiance and the dollar its dangling between disaster and dazzle.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Visiting Madison, my friend took me there because of its reputation for a outstanding selection of Belgian tap beers.

Sure, we ordered beers, but we felt bad about absorbing a lot of table space on a busy Saturday night.  The waitstaff didn't even give us the stink eye.  They were pleasant (downright friendly, even) and professional.  \n\nAllow me to rhapsodize about their beer selection.  I was overwhelmed and elated by it.  I'm pretty sure that I have never seen such an extensive beer list.  They have something like 10-15 Belgian beers on tap (and, like, 50+ in bottles), complete with the appropriate fancy glasses to serve them in.  I am kind of a whore for drinks being served in the correct glass (which was my one beef with Tex Tubb's margaritas--a rocks glass?!  Come on!).  I would highly recommend the \"Saxo\" and \"Poperings Hommel Ale.\"  That Poperings....man, oh man.  It was the most perfect beer I've ever tasted.  All of the beers that my dining companions had (both dark and light) were also phenomenal.  I'd also like to point out that, if you request it, you can get as many samples of the beers on tap as you'd like.  Seriously.\n\nI tried Moule et Frites and in no way was I disappointed.  They bring you a medium-sized mixing bowl full of mussels, drowning in a garlic-butter sauce.  Cue drooling here.  They then plop down a huge metal cone full (FULL) of perfectly cut, spiced, and cooked frites.  Oh, sweet jesus.  While I was face down in my bowl of mussels, I heard things like, \"This steak is $@*&$!% fantastic,\" and \"Ohhhh, the beer braised kale.\"  Nobody was less than 100% enamored with their food.\n\nOn top of everything else, the place is charmingly decorated.

The special of the day \"Scallop salads\" was ok. I would not give more than 3/5 for this dish. Although the overall taste was good, the salad was over dressed, and the scallop had little too much salt on the surface. Entree? I ordered braised beef short ribs with balsamic glaze. It sounded tasty, but again, little excessive on salt, and it tastes nothing special. Worse than that, I don't think it matches the price and all the raves they've been getting.\n\nThe dessert menu needs to be re-worked. Maybe they can incorporate fresh seasonal fruits or something. As of now, it looks terrible.\n\nWaitress's service was on the slow side, but nonetheless, very pleasant. She could recommend me a decent glass of wine to go with my dish.

Two members of our party opted for sandwiches (both great and incredibly well priced), we had an order of frites for the table (plenty for four!), and my mom and I split a few appetizers as our dinner. \n\nNow, I must say, I was truly disappointed with the cheese plate. If this is your thing, resist the temptation! The cheese plate IS my thing, but I didn't know any better. First, our selections could not be well explained to us, what we chose was not all that great (except for the Hooks 10-yr cheddar), and the accompaniments of bread, crackers, sugared walnuts, and olives was simply confusing. Maybe it's just me, but I like my cheese plates with honey, almonds, quince.... \n\nAside from the cheese, I loved the prosciutto wrapped asparagus with poached egg (yummy and charred), and the scallops with pesto were silky, if not a bit too salty. Both were small servings (a given for appetizers) but we probably would have left a bit hungry if we didn't finish our companions sandwiches for them. \n\nOverall, I would be back to try to make some better food choices...it's just so darned cute!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I had been hearing good things about this place, most importantly: the frites.  I've known some good frite:  I used to work 5 blocks away from pomme frites in NYC and have basically tried all their toppings.  \n\nI love the fact that it's a stone's throw from the trader joe's and the neighborhood is precious.  The pedestrian walks have flags you can pick up and drop that you can use to cross the streets; parades can happen ANYWHERE.  \n\nSo, we went after 1ish and it wasn't too packed but noticed there were only two servers.  We weren't in a rush so I thought it would be fine. We ordered and since the husband, whose first love in potato, wouldn't share, we each got an order of frites.  Husband ordered the cheeseburger, our friend Kate got the reuben and I got the avocado BLT.  \n\nAnd then we waited, and waited.  I had to order coffee or else I was going to pass out.  I had just finished a hip hop class so I was starving.  Their beer selection was impressive, with husband pointing out that they serve Wychwood beer, from his hometown in the UK.\n\nWhen we finally got our orders, I noticed the portion of frites were huge and regretted not sharing them with Kate.  I also noticed that a) husband said no tomato and look! tomato and b) the avocado was missing from my AVOCADO BLT.  It took some time to flag the waitress and then she apologizes and brings a plate of sliced avocado for me.  I was like, 'um, great, i get to assemble my own sandwich'.  I drowned out my grumpiness in frites doused in mayo, because fat makes everything okay.\n\nWe felt guilty because we over heard the waitress tell a table that they had run out of frites.  We had ordered the last ones.  But then I thought, hello? it's your signature dish--how can you run out?\n\nAnyway...I would try it again and see how the dinner menu goes and taste their booze.

We decided to stick to the game plan and sat at a table. The waitress came to get our drink order and said \"Well, it could be a half hour, or an hour...who knows. Hopefully they're fixing it.\" Now, when you're hungry, there is a big difference between a half hour and a hour or \"who knows\". She did say that they could make frites, however. We decided to order those as a starter, but before we could even do so, she said that everything was fixed and the kitchen was open. YAY.\n\nWe still went for the frites to split, because we know they're known for them. I'm not sure what I was expecting on the menu...but nothing looked amazing to me(except the Moules et Frites) so I decided to go low-cost and  went with the Avocado BLT, subbing the chipotle-lime aioli for the regular mayo that it usually has. The sides were succotash, chilled red pepper soup, or potato leek soup. I love leeks, so I chose the latter.\n\nThe sandwich was okay, but nothing amazing--but a BLT is pretty much just that, unless it totally sucks.. Same for the soup. It was almost too thick.

Don't let them skip out on serving you bread because you ordered an appetizer.  The butter for the bread (or in my case frites) is too good to miss. \n\nI love their duck entrees and I usually get that every time I go.

Great craft beer selection, but with a focus on Belgians. Excellent, locally sourced food, with the menu updated seasonally.  \n\nTheir double fried frites are the best in town.\n\nThe menu does change seasonally, but there are some popular staple items that are left untouched, mainly steak frites and the moules frites, along with a selection of sandwiches. Almost all of which I've tried by this point, and I've yet to have a bad meal here. As other reviewers have mentioned, this place set a new bar for what I think a burger can be. The V Burger is definitely the best  burger I've had in my life thus far. Hopefully something I will continue to experience in the afterlife, as it tastes like heaven.  (hint: it's likely the combo of the burger juices that mix in with the aioli that take this burger to the next level) . Their cheese boards are a great cross-section of primarily Wisconsin produced cheeses.\n\nI would argue that Chef Rob is one of the best chefs in Madison, as to an amateur observer, what comes out of the kitchen is always very consistent, and nearly always perfectly prepared - even if Chef Rob himself is not in the kitchen. To me that means that all of the kitchen staff actually care and want to succeed in making good food. That makes a lot of difference!\n\nThe service is generally very friendly and attentive. And although I've had some slow service when they are quite busy, I can understand that. Slow service certainly isn't the norm though, so no points lost from me.  \n\nExpect to wait for a table during peak hours, sometimes up to an hour or more, as the place is absolutely tiny. I have no problem waiting for anything from here though, it's made up for in the quality and deliciousness of the beer and food on offer.  My tip? Sit at the bar if it's busy. Or, if you have a long wait, put your name on the list and go grab a beer or glass of wine at Barrique's Wine Cave while you wait.\n\nIt's also not uncommon to see Matt the owner tending bar during dinner hours and socializing. He's a very nice guy and passionate about beer. A great fountain of knowledge.\n\nThey also occasionally offer up beer tastings and educational sessions where you can learn about beer. I've attended a couple of these and had a fantastic time learning about the origins of some of their european and belgian beers. \n\nThe lunch menu is a bit more limited, and provides mostly their salads and sandwiches, but there is typically a good special on offer.\n\nOne reviewer mentioned they only have the lunch menu Sunday nights.

That may be due to the fact that Belgian food is a novelty in Phoenix, but I think it also has to do with the value-for-your-dollar that this restaurant offers. Four of us had three salads, two appetizers, three entrees, two desserts, an iced tea and five glasses of wine. With tax and tip, the tab came to just under $200. It's like the menu is in Euros instead of US Dollars given the current lousy exchange rate. The problem is that we're dining in Phoenix, not somewhere in Belgium. Factoring in the \"transitional\" location on 7th Street, $200 is too much to pay for the meal that we had. No wonder there's always plenty of tables at Trente-Cinq.\n\nChef Lionel Geuskens states on his website, \"I have always wanted to cook all of my favorite dishes.\" That's a laudable goal, but Chef Lionel needs to remember that his restaurant is located in the Valley of the Sun and not Belgium. He needs to add some seasonal dishes to his boilerplate menu. When I first visited in the fall, the hearty dishes were perfect for the season. When I recently had dinner with the BF and two friends at T-C in June, the menu seemed heavy and clunky. If the chef insists on keeping his hearty menu, he'd do well to close for the summer and wait for the weather to cool off before serving his stick-to-your-ribs fare.\n\nI started off with the Boulettes ($10) appetizer. The menu says it's a dish of \"mini\" meatballs served in an herbed tomato sauce with mixed greens on the side. Three meatballs arrived that were as big as tennis balls. This dish was a good value as it could have been an entree, if you like eating thee meatballs for your dinner. The side salad was a weird accompaniment and very much appeared as an afterthought. The BF ordered the Salade D'endive ($9), which featured Belgian endive tossed with mixed greens, herbed goat cheese and candied walnuts with a raspberry vinaigrette. The portion was large, but the BF said my meatballs were a better choice.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the Waterzooi ($23). This dish was also the entree I ordered on my first visit to T-C. It's basically a hearty fish soup of salmon, halibut, shrimp, scallops, mussels and vegetables in a saffron cream broth. Unfortunately, it was much tastier the first time. This time the sauce was fairly flat, which is a real disappointment given the saffron. The BF ordered what the menu purports to be the \"national dish of Belgium,\" Moules Au Vin Blanc ($19). It is a bowl of mussels steamed in white wine with leeks, celery, green onions and fresh herbs. It was a large serving of mussels and the BF felt it was a fair deal. Unlike the French version he's had at other places, the broth in this dish was not at all enjoyable on its own.\n\nFor our dining companions, one friend ordered the Coquilles Ostendaise ($12) appetizer as his entree. I had this dish as my appetizer on my first visit and it looked good this time as well. But then again, how can you go wrong with scallops baked in a cheese bechamel? His BF ordered the Steak Au Poivre ($28). The filet mignon was served with a green peppercorn sauce and fries. The steak was petit for the grand $28 price tag.\n\nOur meal took a real dive in terms of value with dessert. The BF and I shared the Mousse Au Chocolat ($6). As billed on the menu, it was a trio of white, milk and dark chocolate mousses. The surprising part was the portion size. Given that this dessert is basically chocolate pudding, it was a bit surprising for it to arrive in what was essentially a double shot glass. It was good, but not $6 good. Our friends decided to share the Tropezienne ($8). The menu claims that this dessert is French brioche pastry filled with creamy vanilla custard. I'll allow for some hyperbole in menu writing, but this dessert was anything but French pastry filled with custard. It was really a slice of flat vanilla cake that had been cut in half and filled with what tasted like vanilla pudding. Ironically, our friend who ordered this dish is a pastry chef and it goes without saying that he was not impressed with this dessert.\n\nIf only the decor was as fun and inviting as the restaurant website would lead you to believe. This place either ascribes to a minimalist aesthetic or there wasn't budget to make the space interesting. It has a lower mid-range European hotel feel.\n\nThe service was attentive.  However, that wasn't enough to off-set the over-priced menu.\n\nIt is interesting to have a Belgian restaurant in Phoenix. If only Chef Lionel would alter his menu to reflect the seasons and discount his prices so that they appear to be in US Dollars rather than in Euros. Then Trente-Cinq would be good to go. Hopefully these changes will occur before T-C shutters its doors for good.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 8, "cool": 4}}, {"text": "Food was wonderful.

This restaurant made it for me. In a world of chain restaurants I treasure unique high-quality places to dine. One thing that bores me to tears is menus that all look a like.

After a bit of searching we came upon Trente-Cinq.  We were VERY impressed with this restaurant.  We had the scallop and asparagus appetizers which were great! Then I had the lamb shank for dinner which was the best lamb shank I have ever had. It was in a flavorful sweet broth with couscous and sweet potatoes on the side.  Our friends had the mussels which we were worried about given that we are used to very fresh seafood.  However, the chef did not disappoint. Overall the food was fresh, properly seasoned and VERY flavorful. A true Phoenix gem.\n\nThe only downside was that there were not more people in the restaurant.
