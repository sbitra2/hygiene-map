It was kind of like they wanted to write me and tell me how kind they were waving the late charges when it was their fault for not calling me sooner. When I emailed them back explaining that I was disappointed with how late the cupcakes were delivered all I got was a \"sorry\".... \"please call us as soon as possible and make final payment\".... not what I expected.

We had things like truffles, toffee, chocolate covered everything, cakelets, and some tartlets/mousses. Everything was delicious. The delivery was a lil late. So, that wasn't fun and it made things a lil more stressful but it was just a lot of fun. I will tell you this much, because everything is so customized, prices aren't what they are in a mom and pop shop. Delish!! Their flavors are awesome. Some of them have cute lil names like the Sexy Red Velvet and the Confetti Party. I love their raspberry mousse filling inside the chocolate marble cake. THat was soooo good.

First I think they are WAY to expensive (luckily I had a Groupon for them so I only ended up spending $30 even though my order cost $54). I ordered 2 dozen cake pops for my daughters' birthdays. On their website the pops are cylindrical in shape, when I receives mine they were round (like the ones they advertise on tv. Ones I could have baked myself and saved money). Some of them did not have icing (which I think was white chocolate) covering all of it. The cake didn't seem to be cooked all the way, instead of being light & fluffy it was very dense. \nI'm not sure why I got such a shotty deal b/c I noticed they had a lot of great reviews.\nThe only thing I'll give them is we had no conflicts, they were pleasant to deal with (which was through email)", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Sealing the deal!\n\nI saw the sign facing the 215 for weeks.  Drove by one day only to find out it wasn't open for business yet.  As the weeks went by, I stared longing at that sign EVERY damned day, wondering when the hell I was going to get my chance.\n\nThen, by chance, my wife decided she would get me some sugar and they were open!  She came home with a really nice bag that contained these attractive pink boxes with clear cellophane lids (presumably to see the contents, eh?).  Unfortunately for my review, she's not very detail oriented, so I can't really tell you the exact names of what she bought, nor can I even describe the store and what other goods they offer.   Here's what we ended up with, according to her recollection:\n\n1.  Cake pops: They were chocolate cake with a chocolate shell.  Besides my not understanding the whole cupcake fad (is it really going to last?), I have hated - no really HATED - the whole cake pop thing.  All the ones I've had were either tasteless, dry, way too dense or a combination thereof.  These, however, were the anti-thesis to all that I have hated (HATED) about cake pops.  These were rich, moist and cake-like (as opposed to tasting like they mixed a pound of frosting with some leftover crumbs to hold it all together).  The only thing I hated (HATED) about these particular cake pops is that they were too doggone small.  One bite.  That's all it took.  :(\n\n1.  Red Velvet cupcakes: ok, so it didn't take a genius to know what this one was.  These were tasty, but not as moist or rich as the red velvet I know and love.  Ok substitute, but not enough to make me crave them.\n\n2.  Peanut butter cupcake: I'm not really a fan of peanut butter pastries, so I didn't even take a bite.  She liked them, but she was short on adjectives, so I can't really elaborate.\n\n3.  Bacon Banana cupcake: un-holy-freaking-rock-my-sugar-tooth-believable.  If you know me, you know I'm a bacon addict.  This cupcake was a revelation, a total mouth f***.  But let me back up and start at the beginning.  Once upon a time, there was this little confection that didn't smell all that enticing.  Had it not been for the bacon chunks on the frosting, I would have skipped it.  The scent was a bit confusing, starting with overt rendered bacon fat tones and an undercurrent of burnt sugar.  Not the most appetizing combo in all honestly.  Anyway, after cutting it in two, only then could I smell banana, which really threw my nose for a loop.  Then I took a bite.  I can't say it was heaven, nor that it was the best thing I have eaten in my life.  What I can and will say is that the flavor combination just works.  The sweet of the frosting and salty of the bacon are harmonious, with the tropical banana adding a whole new dimension.  \n\nI love inventive dishes that a cook/chef prepares that tries to let you in on a secret.  Sometimes you're just not meant to understand that secret and other times, when you get it, it totally makes you respect the thought and effort behind the creation.  The bacon banana cupcake really sealed the deal for me.  I'll be back to try some other unique creations.

My picks:\n\nMaple Bacon ....Nutella......Candy Cane\n\nOuter shell had a delicate crisp, inside was airy soft, and they nailed it on flavor in all the fillings.  Especially the Maple Bacon. Love the combo of savory bacon filling and sweet candied bacon crumbs.  The nutella was topped with crushed hazelnuts and drizzled with Nutella with Nutella filling. The Candy Cane one was a treat too! Partly dipped with chocolate with crushed candy canes and a peppermint filling. All three I would so order again. For the quality and portion you get, $3-4 a macacon is pretty reasonable to me.\n\nChocolate Chip Cookies! - I was told they bake them to order! How about that for a late night treat? Warm just out of the oven cookies!\n \nMy hot chocolate was divine as well. Also you can help yourself to complimentary chilled water housed in a glass jug.\n \n\nThe shop is a nice size for a bake shop. It has a modern Parisian flair to it. There are several tables, including a long table perfect for groups and families. Two separate sitting areas where you can just chill, socialize too.

Black and white interior and the colors come from the beautiful cakes, pastries and macarons they have. I'm actually wishing my birthday was much sooner so I can get a birthday cake from here. They serve hot chocolate, tea and coffee, milk, juice, soda...and alcohol (at night). Champagne, wine and beer + dessert? Can I just live here? \n\nBefore I continue, I must say that my love for macarons started when I first had them in Paris - oh l'amour! So, I'm not one of those that eat them because they're trendy or whatever. The fad can die but I'd still love macarons. These French cookies are my faves just like chunky chocolate chip cookies. I'd go to a macaron shop at every city I visit for comparison and get macarons in ALL their flavors. So, I'm glad the Vegas area has Gimme Some Sugar. My true test for macarons is pistachio macarons but unfortunately, they didn't have it when I went but I think you can special order items a day before.\n\nThey have 10 macaron flavors at a time. I think 2 are seasonal flavors and 8 mainstays. I've tried 10 flavors: fig & goat cheese, Snickerdoodle, strawberries & champagne, Nutella, PB&J, grandpa's blueberry pancake, birthday cake, maple-bacon, Snickers Candy bar and chocolate-covered strawberry. I got 14 macarons - I had to get an extra fig and goat cheese macaron and 2 extra Nutella macarons. I also got a fresh fruit pavlova and a green tea cheesecake. As for the macarons, here's how each ranks:\n\n5/5: fig & goat cheese, Nutella, chocolate-covered strawberry\n\n4/5: Snickerdoodle, PB&J, Snickers candy bar, maple-bacon bar\n\n3/5: strawberries & champagne, grandpa's blueberry pancake, birthday cake\n\nGreen Tea Cheesecake:\nI love green tea and not a lot of places have green tea cheesecake. The crust is crunchy. The cheesecake is deliciously creamy with a good green tea flavor. It's topped with a thin sesame nougatine and a raspberry. Amazing! 5/5\n\nFresh Fruit Pavlova:\nA pavlova is a meringue topped with fruits. It's light and crisp. It's like a \"healthier\" dessert if you will. 5/5\n\nThey warned me that the birthday cake was really sweet and that I shouldn't get it if I was torn between that and another flavor. Hooray for honesty! The fig & goat cheese macaron sounds a bit unusual but it's actually good since I love goat cheese. Sweet fig + tart goat cheese...yum! Nutella is a no-brainer...it's instant love for me. The strawberries & champagne sounded real good and looks so pretty and dainty but the flavors were mild but really sweet. I think the strawberry flavor needs to be more pronounced. I got lucky to have the last maple-bacon macaron. Score! \n\nThe service is amazing here. Very friendly and honest. I was holding up the line with all the desserts I got and I felt bad for the people behind me who came in just to pick up 2 items. But one of the girls who was helping me out offered them a cookie so everything was fine and dandy. Sure, the desserts here cost an average of $7 apiece and the macarons are $3.50-4.50 each - the macarons are HUUUUGE though (the size of your palm or about 4 macarons) and the ingredients are of quality. Hello? I don't mind paying for something good. You can actually get $1 off with a Yelp check-in.

Without a doubt a 'cute' shop with friendly service provided by a young lady named Brenda it was just after 7:00pm when I walked into the small store and with a short line fronted by a woman and her daughter planning a 'Sweet 16' party I spent some time perusing the items and chatting with other customers, seemingly each with a different favorite amongst the store's nearly twenty options.  Featuring plated desserts, custom cakes, jars, cookies, and other take-home treats it was with an eye on variety that I ordered when I approached the front of the line and self-selecting a few favorites along with two selections confirmed by Brenda to be as good as the crowd had suggested I made my way to the door immediately indulging in a buttery cinnamon-laced snickerdoodle with crispy edges and a soft center, the first of a half dozen +1 items tallying $25 after tax and tip.  Showing some restrained and retaining the rest of my purchase for the twenty-seven minute drive home it was with coffee in hand that I continued my tasting first with a bananas-foster-esque cupcake that was plenty moist but somewhat marred by overly sweet frosting but moving on to the dense peanut butter blondie things improved substantially, the dense square loaded with rich chocolate tones and roasted organic peanut butter, a classic combo only improved after a minute on a warm skillet.  Moving finally to what has seemingly become LoVullo's 'signature' item, it was with a quartet of macarons that I rounded out my evening and with each palm-sized cookie featuring a characteristic crackle over rich flavors, the texture of the crmb was actually far more dense than the Parisian classic - a moist cake-like consistency akin to the American whoopie pie and although perhaps not 'traditional,' entirely delicious - both the dense chocolate dipped Snickers and rich, savory Fig and Goat Cheese \"Whooparons\" undoubtedly justifying the nearly hour-long round trip...though if they ever decide to expand I definitely see a market for a second shop in ever trendy Summerlin.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 9, "cool": 7}}, {"text": "I love how cute and funky this little bakery is.

Tri-tip, even untrimmed, contains no gristle, so it had to be some other inferior cut.  Au jus means \"its own juices\", but this was certainly some sort of reconstituted powder (or worse) with very little beef taste to speak of.  But it did improve the sandwich.  Lastly, the roll has more in common with a hot dog bun than a baguette.  You don't get to call a roll \"French\" just because of its shape.\n\nThere was a distinct smell of skunk coming from one of the cars in the parking lot on our way out.

My wife and I checked it out in the evening of their opening day and were greeted by the owner Gary.\n\nMy wife had a bean and cheese burro, chimichanga style (pictured).  I'm guessing the fry oil was fresh and super hot, because the shell of the chimi was perfectly toasted, flaky and wasn't greasy at all.  We didn't expect to find rice inside, but the ingredients were all fresh and tasted great.  Gary hooked my wife up with their super-fire-burner-hot sauce, and while I can't do those types of things, my wife said it has great flavor and was indeed very hot.  The regular salsa was fresh and had excellent flavor as well.\n\nI wanted to confirm the mesquite grilled bacon cheeseburger lived up to my memory.  It did.  I ordered the Big Bueno, which is a double patty.  The bacon was perfect (extra crispy, who likes flabby bacon on a burger?!?). They cook the patties to pink in the middle, so if you like it well done you'll have to let them know.  I checked out the onion rings as well which were cooked perfectly and tasty.\n\nGary also brought around a \"Arizona\" style burger that had been mis-ordered.  It has green chili beef with green chili on top.  Very tasty!\n\nShowing up at a new restaurant on opening day is a real treat because usually it's about the only time you'll see owners and managers.  We chatted up both Gary and his wife (the owners) and met the General Manager as well.   We talked about myself being a \"Yelper\" and how it can be sort of a mixed bag for restaurants.  It seems most people only take the time to review when they've had either a really good experience or a bad one.  There is no middle-ground with most Yelpers (myself included).  Despite some of the negative reviews in the past,  I feel that the owners and management here are absolutely committed to treating the customers well and delivering a great product.  I feel very strongly about supporting these types of family owned and local businesses, and I look forward to working my way across their menu.\n\nFOOD: Fresh and fast.  Portion size is good.  The chimi and burger were full sized, however I'm used to a bit more fries (and/or rings), but personally i'm trying to avoid the \"super size\" mentality, so it's fine by me.\n\nKITCHEN & DINING ROOM: The grill area is right in front and mostly viewable from the counter.

Change the fryer oil regularly. O-rings were ok but they looked and tasted burnt. \n\n3. Hard to find a clean table, tend to the dining room and regularly wipe down your tables. \n\n4. More garbage cans. Customers (not me) had trouble finding it. Put one by the door upon exiting, and throw a small one by the straw caddy so patrons can dispose of their wrappers. \n\n5.

The new restaurant  and menu has been trimmed down and the deli case is also gone but most of the top favorites still are here. \n\nWe had our own smorgasbord and tried a variety of things.\n\nMy husband never had a potato knish before so we ordered one. (appetizer $4.) It was very fresh and came out warm with a side of beef gravy. It tasted just like fresh ones I had before from a bakery I used to go to. I ate only a quarter of it just to try but my husband who never had a knish before enjoyed it and finished it off. \n\nI went with the soup and half sandwich and tried the matzo ball soup. What impressed me the most about the soup was that it was very fresh tasting and the white meat chicken in it was very tender and correctly cooked. (I hate dry chicken and just get bummed when I get dry chicken out. Places that give me dry chicken I usually give two stars.) The soup broth was very thin and light as Matzo Ball is suppose to be because this soup is about the ball. I liked the fresh still with body carrots in it and the pasta was fresh and not soggy. The Matzo ball was the lightest fluffiest one I ever had. I do prefer Matzo Ball soup seasoned with dill but not everyone does. No dill in the Matzo Ball soup here but it was good as it was and is enough to feed one person. \n\nI tasted a spoonful of my husband's Sweet and Sour Cabbage soup. It was tasty I might try that one next time?\n\nMy husband went with the Reuben Sliders ($9.75) but with the kraut and sauce on the side. To his surprise he really enjoyed the kraut and especially the house made dressing as it was really delicious. The sliders are considered one of Phoenix Arizona's top five things to try according to the AZ Republic as they are very tasty. They are Three  Sandwiches of House Own Recipe pickled corned beef,  House Own recipe Pastrami and Brisket grilled on potato latkes. I tasted each and all were good but I liked the pastrami best.\n\nMy half sandwich was the pastrami on rye. My sandwich was tasty as it was but would have been much better and elevated as the sliders were if I asked for it hot so if you get the corned beef or pastrami make sure you ask for it hot because it's much tastier that way. I liked that the bread was real rye and not that squishy Arizona Rye you get at other places. The cole slaw was very fresh tasting but on the sweet side but had a pleasant celery seed after taste that I liked. ($12.50 !/2 sandwich with soup)\n\nOur server Sean was OUTSTANDING very friendly and helpful.\n\nThey have a beautiful large dog friendly patio and free Wifi.\n\nMazel Tov!\n\n\n\n They did the soft opening as they are still working things out but Really did a Good Job!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 5, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "We loved Abe's Deli in Scottsdale and now that it's Miller's Deli & Grill (same owner as Abe's) in a new location. it's even better!
