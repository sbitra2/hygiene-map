A few minutes later I get a variety of side dishes and he tells me I can have refills on anything, just let him know.  Now I don't always know what each side dish is by name but I have had a few of the ones they offered before at other places.  It was SOOOOO good, and he was reallly nice too.  While I was tasting my side dishes, an older gentlemen was setting a table and asked if I liked the kimchi. I told him it was really good and I liked that it wasn't overly spicy. (My personal taste is I like spicy as long as it it balanced with flavor, not just simply spicy to burn the hell out of someone's mouth) He told me he and his wife makes that kimchi at home and they ferment it for many months (I forgot how long he told me)  He offered me more and well how could I turn him down I mean he and his wife worked for a long time on their home made kimchi.  :-)\n\nThen all of a sudden to my surprise I get an appetizer of their green onion and seafood pancake (which I was not expecting). It was the size of a mini pizza approx 3-4 inches in diameter. It was delicious.  \n\nThen my combination seafood tofu pot came and it looked exactly how it should have.  They cracked an egg into it for me and every bite I took it was SOO delicious and my server was really nice, always asking me how I enjoyed it and if I wanted more side dishes or anything at all.  \n\nMy ONLY comment is this... The pot I ordered said on the menu shrimp,clams and oyster.  NONE of this was in my pot.  Instead I had mussels and calamari.  Now don't get me wrong.. I enjoyed every single bite, but I had picked that pot for a reason and I'm not a big fan of mussells.   Otherwise I'd have gotten the tofu and dumpling pot.  \n\nI don't know if everyone who worked there is all family related or not, but I truly felt like I was having dinner at someone's home.  \n\nMy bill was $9 yes $9 for all that food and I tipped him $5 (plus he was reallllly cute lol)  \n\nThis place is just up the street from me and I would ABSOLUTELY go back again \n\nIf they read this review...

Yesterday \n\nHi\n\nJK\n\nI am Shawn the owner of Mashisoyo.

Yesterday \nI ordered a spicy soup and it smelt like shin ramyon soup. Seeing you didn't deny the usage of ramen soup, probably you are using it? Even if you didn't intentionally use MSG, using flavored salt (Mat-so-geum) or ramen soup means the served soup should contain MSG. I remember the server saying you use special sauce for spicy taste. I don't know what kind of sauce you are using, but I am pretty sure it contains MSG or equivalent artificial flavor. \n\nI didn't even mention your pork bulgogi that also tasted like MSG or beef dashida. Please check the sauces you are using before claiming your dishes are free of MSG.\n\n----------------------\n  Shawn A. 6 hours ago \nfirst, there is no way you can buy ramen soup only from markets and even if we used shinramen soup it does not contains MSG so your guess is wrong again.I We are tofu house and I studied and researched a long time to find what our  fofu soup takes to be loved by people and people love our soup and bbq these days. They wait in line to have our food. You don't want to say they are wrong about our food.\n\nI advise you not to eat out if you worry so much about MSG because even a hamburger, taco burrito, fried chicken, pho, Thai, steaks, American BBQ,...many more use the ingredients have a bit of mono sodium but FDA says still it is NO harm to people.\n\nLastly I would like to say you in a nice way NOT to criticize easily.

She asked if it was eat in or take out and then she gave me time to look at their menu.  I had almost decided before I went to get the curry flavor sundubu.  I asked the woman if their was a spiciness level to order and she asked the chef.  She then asked, \"Do you want it spicy.\"  \"Yes\" was my quick reply.  She called that back to the chef.\n\nI sat for a few minutes while I waited for my takeout.  I could see them packing 5 small containers with banchan and then the chef came out with the larger container of curry sundubu.  He asked me if I liked it spicy wiht almost a 'good luck' kind of sound to his voice.\n\nWhen I got home and had my first spoon of the soft tofu with the spicy, curry flavor, I was hooked.  Wow, is it good!  The banchans were very tasty and I was surprised when I opened the container of rice and found my seafood pancake on top.

Unfortunately, my experience with them from June-July was an absolute nightmare.. \n\nI first learned about Gina's when I purchased their burratta at my local farmer's market, It was great and when speaking to the rep at the farmer's market, I learned that they sold wines, pizzas, homemade sauces and more at their Scottsdale store location. I started going about once a month and purchasing pizza's, biscotti and wine. I learned that they were starting to hold classes and I was super excited. Even though my boyfriend was out of town, I signed up for their cheese making class in January. I had been wanting to learn how to make mozzarella cheese for years. The class was great. I met some wonderful people and even though the class was a bit crowded, it was totally worth the money. \n\nWhen I had the chance to tell my boyfriend about it, he wanted to sign up too, so a pasta making class, sauce making class and several trips to their retail store in the following months, we thought we had found a great, neighborhood spot to meet like minded people and learn how to make great Italian food. \n\nThe last class we took was in May and they told us that they were going to have a \"food rave\" on June 8th which would consist of endless amounts of food, wine and great music, etc. My boyfriend was out of town but I knew it would be a great night, so I paid $100 and signed up. I was looking forward to it for weeks and on the day of the event, I was nervous about how formal it would be, so I called to ask about the dress code. I received an email two hours before the event from one of the owners, Chris Buskirk to tell me that the event had been cancelled due to an illness of one of their children. In the email he asked if I wanted to use the $100 as a credit for product in the store or a credit to a future class. I wrote him back less than 3 minutes later and stated that I was sorry to hear that their kids were sick and said that I'd like to use the money for a future class. In fact, I knew that there was an appetizer class being held on June 25th, so I would call later in the week and reschedule for that class. I figured that since that class was cheaper, both me and my boyfriend could go!\n\nI never heard anything back. EVER. I called a few times a week for the next two weeks, sent emails... nothing. June 25th passed and I missed out on the appetizer class. The few times that I would not get an answering machine and actually got an employee on the phone, they would tell me that they personally delivered my message to both of the owners and they didn't know why they weren't calling me back. I felt like a stalker. None of my emails were addressed, none of my phone calls were EVER returned. I wanted to go to the store in person but felt embarrassed and awkward. I kept trying to call for another few weeks and each time the owners were never available but the messages had been delivered according to the staff. I was utterly confused. I still am. Eventually, when it had been a full month of me trying to get in touch with them to no avail, I contacted my credit card company to have the money refunded to my account. \n\nTo this day, I never received an explanation, an apology or anything.

Can't go wrong with the soups, salads, or sandwiches. The only complaint is that it can get a little pricier than similar places, around $10-$11 for a sandwich and small drink.

At this point I'm already here and I'm hungry so I settle.\n\nSECOND: I will give an \"A\" for Politeness and Speed, the woman was kind and pointed out a similar item on the menu to accommodate my needs, I order a veggie Sandwitch on Sourdough with Dijon mustard, a side of chips, and a pickle and it comes out to around $7.50, not bad.\n\nTHIRD: I get the food shortly after (granted it wasn't busy or anything) I would say like 5 min later not bad at all, and it's a very good size Sandwitch, a nice helping of ruffles, and two pickle spears, so as far as the amount of food I got it was worth the price.\n\nFINALLY: When I bite in to the Sandwitch I can NOT taste the mustard it tasted like there was none, when I open up the Sandwitch it was some type of home made mustard (which is usually pretty good and exciting to try) but it wasn't a traditional mustard spread, it was some type of mustard seeds? It was very very bland, and then the SOURDOUGH bread (the bread being what this place is known for obviously) tasted NO different from regular White bread, I'm almost positive there was a mistake and I got white instead, all in all it was very filling, the staff was kind, and the food came quick, not to mention the price point was not bad at all, but the Sandwitch tasted identical to something I would have made at home at a smaller price point, it was mediocre at best, I would not go OUT of my way to come back but if I'm in a pinch and it's within a quarter mile of my location I might go back.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Yum, Yum and......did I say, \"Yum!?\" I've been here several times and have never been disappointed.

The salad and sandwiches we ordered were just average.  The sides of bacon and avocado that I ordered were decent, as was the apricot walnut bread.  My son didn't like the cookie he ordered for dessert.  \n\nMore people started coming in as we were leaving, and I noticed a decent looking soup served to another customer.
