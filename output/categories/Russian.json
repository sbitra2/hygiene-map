We ordered some home made fruit drink that did not agree with our palates, and sumsa (which is bread, filled with ground beef and onions) to start with.

I always wondered what the hype was about borscht. The problem is that there aren't many Russian eateries in Phoenix (just this place and another up north, that I know of) so I never had the chance to try out this cuisine. Then a Russian friend told me about a Russian-Uzbeki place he heard about called Samarkand Restaurant and naturally I went, and he came along with me. We've actually been there twice already. \n\nLike Mr. K's review said, it's in a strip mall which sits directly across the street from another strip mall in which the Russian Market resides (I have reviewed the Russian Market too). We walked in and immediately got a whiff of some sort of soup (it was pelmeni soup, more on that later) and got an eye full of the nice decor (they did some decorating since Gina W's earlier review); mirrored walls with pictures of domed mosques, a chandelier, gold inlay adorned tile floors, fancy dishware set out on each table, and of course, traditional Uzbeki-Russian music playing overhead. Behind the counter there's a framed picture of Mike Tyson himself posing with with Svetlana and her husband at the restaurant. Apparantly Mike has a taste for more than just mutulated ears and he has stopped by a few times for a bite (no cheesy pun intended). We stepped forward and Svetlana greeted us, told us to take a seat, and handed us menus. The food is actually pretty good. This is what we ordered on our first and second visits: \n------------------------------ \nFirst visit: We weren't fully familiar with the menu, so Svetlana sat down and walked us through the menu. I got: \n\n**Borscht - The infamous borscht that I had heard so much about. It was pretty good; tasted similar to what I thought it would taste like. \n\n**Pirozhki - Small meat filled pies approximately the size of a dinner roll. You'll find these under the appetizer section as \"Samsa\", the Uzbek alternate name, but they'll know what you mean by pirozhki. My friend and myself loved these. We ate a couple of them. l recommend you get a couple of these, you won't regret it. Our second visit was mainly inspired by the pirozhki and lipioshka alone. \n\n**Lipioshka - A danish-like round bread served hot and fresh. We shared it, and much like Mr. K, we also really liked it and it's very filling. This bread comes with a tasty sauce that you dip the lipioshka into. It's much like salsa but with a greener/leafier taste. I recommend also getting the lipioshka along with the pirozhki. \n\n**My friend also got pelmeni soup and two marinated beef kebabs with a complimentary side of rice. \n----------------------------- \nSecond visit: Like the first time, we asked for pirozhki and a lipioshka again. This time I decided to try the pelmeni soup and I came to find out that the whiff that you first get as you walk in is that of this soup. I really don't know why it smells like pelmeni, seeing as to how it's obviously not the only thing that's prepared there. Anyhow, the soup itself is simple but good. It's basically ravioli squares stuffed with beef in a broth with a sort of grass. Very filling. Again, my friend ordered some kebabs with rice and onions. \n----------------------------- \nJust like another reviewer said, you will be full for hours. We will be going back to Samarkand later on. (If you are wondering about price, my friend and myself spent $15-$17 each, both times there.) I recommend it because the food is good and filling and besides, how many other Russian-Uzbeki joints have you seen around town? None right? Then here you have the opportunity to experience a culinary rarity. And If a tough nail like Mike Tyson likes it, then you know it must be good. And besides, you wouldn't want to disagree with Mike's choice; we know what happens when someone has a disagreement with him. Just watch the news.

After making a bit of noise for about 3-4 minutes, a lady came out and seated us.\n\nThe woman was very friendly and did a good job making recommendations. The food took a while to arrive. The soups we had were great and so was the salad. We had some shish kabbabs (lamb, beef and sea-bass). The beef and sea bass was good, but the lamb had bits of bone and was fairly gristly. The rice was good for the first few bites and then I got a mouthful of slimey wierdness once I got through the top layer. If you ask for water, you get a bottle of Aquafina, which is fine, but unexpected.\n\nWhile we were eating, another party showed up (that makes 2 groups total). Even though the place was almost empty, it took almost 10 minutes to get our check and another 5 to pay.

Little meat pies came next and were quite good with a tomato-based sauce, thicker than salsa but without the mexican pepper spice taste.  Next we had a skewer apiece of lamb and beef shishkabob on a base of wonderful rice w/ slices of raw onion.  Of course we had hot tea to go with it all.\nInside the restaurant, it was clean and nice.

This place has both, and desperate to flex my Russian language and culture muscles in Phoenix, I went into this restaurant on a Saturday afternoon to grab a menu to find the place completely empty. We left to go shopping and returned over two hours later to find this place still empty, but we sat down after the great reviews, and my over-powering love for Russian and Middle Eastern food. No one greeted us, and we stood in the doorway calling, \"Hello?\" at an increasing volume. After several minutes I wandered into the kitchen and asked if they are open, to the disgruntled and seemingly annoyed owners that said yes. \n\nThe lady that I assume was the owner was very nice, she helped us navigate around the bread menu and recommended the Kompot, which was a little sweeter than I have experienced before, but was still decent. Her husband in the kitchen was yelling at her the entire time not fifteen feet from our table, and I never complain about ambience, but even this bothered me. \nThe borscht came, which was large chunks of beets cut into thirds, and carots nearly whole boiled in water. I know I am used to the creamy Saint Petersburg borscht and this is more of an Uzbek restaurant, but it was so flavorless and disappointing I had to add table salt to the clear pink broth (and I really hate salt). The lamb was all gristle and fat, and the chicken was very dry. I asked the owner/our server if she had any sour cream for the borscht. She looked at me with a blank stare without saying anything, so I asked the same question in Russian, to which she stared at me as if I was a moron that asked her for a golden pony. She said no, and disappeared into the kitchen without a word.\n\nHalfway through the meal a young woman came into the restaurant and started speaking frantically to me, in a language that was neither English or Russian. She grabs my arm and starts to corral me towards the kitchen (as I am still mid bite, chewing) and places what I think was a business card in my hand and yells at me pointing, to what I assume was a command to give it to the owner. After I swallow and get past my initial moment of absolute puzzlement of why I have to do this, I notify the owner that someone is looking for her, and walk back to my table, very confused. The owner screams at the girl until she runs out the door, and without pause or apology, refills our water glasses with a smile.\n\nI will break from my story to address the decor in which everyone seems to be upset about. It was probably on of my favorite aspects of the dining experience. Blue ocean wallpapers and mirrors gave this small restaurant a unique and more open feel, and it felt distinctly like Uzbekistan. It was certaintly not a 5 star dining experience, so who expects the decor to match?\n\nSo after we paid and left, we mumbled with a confused laugh that the dining experience was...well, an experience, but I will probably not return. I reviewed this a few months late, so perhaps they have gotten their act together, or maybe just came on a very peculiar day?

You wouldn't guess based on the outward appearance, basically a storefront in the shopping center by the Copp's in Fitchburg, but this is really a top-notch restaurant.  I'd never really tried Russian cuisine other than the beef stroganoff that was my father's speciality and a couple of late-night stops at Pelmeni (RIP) before coming here with a friend last year.  He's part Polish descent and he kept saying how much the food reminded him of the meals his grandmother used to make when his family would visit Milwaukee years ago.  I'm not Russian or Polish and my two grandmothers' delicious meals were standard American fare, so I wasn't expecting to share his nostalgia.  But the food here has the unmistakeable quality of good comfort food that just feels like home.  \n\nI set the bar pretty high on my first visit, trying the \"Zarski\" stuffed pork loin with a spring salad and buckwheat (kasha).  This coupled with several Baltika #6 Porters made for a very filling meal and a strong desire to return.  The next time I came with my father, who went for the beef stroganoff to see how it measured up to his own.  This entree comes without accompanying noodles like my father has always done, but the beef with sauce is so rich and thick it did not seem to require anything else.  My father really enjoyed this, and has subsequently ordered it every time since, but his real love was the kasha.  I went with the stuffed cabbage, which is a dish that I've never really loved before.  Arbat's has a something more, maybe the spice or the tomato sauce, that puts it over the threshold.  This turned out to be the perfect meal on cold March night, and I came away convinced that this was going to be a regular destination.\n\nI've tried a decent amount of the menu to date, and I still put the stuffed pork loin with the kasha as my all-time favorite.  The pelmeni dumplings are delicious but it always seems like they're missing something without the spicy red sauce I used to get at Pelmeni on State.  The potato and cheese vareniki are really amazing, and the meatballs with mushroom sauce are pretty good themselves.  I'm personally a big fan of the Russian and Lithuanian beers that are served, but be careful because these are powerful - around 6 to 8% ABV - and come in big half-liter bottles.  There are only a couple of things that keep this place from being a no-doubt five star place.  The location does leave a bit to be desired for atmosphere, and the restrooms aren't even in the same place - you need to walk into the lobby of whatever is next door, and once the lights didn't even work.  Last winter we were seated next to the door, which led to cold blasts of February air every time someone came or went.  This didn't bother me as much as it did my mother, but it would be nice if they had some kind of curtain or something.  Also, there only seems to be one server every time I've been and on busy nights it can be a wait.  But these are minor trifles compared to the greatness of the food.

Needless to say, I may be somewhat biased as this does bring back a lot of nice memories from my childhood. \n\nThe restaurant looks pretty insignificant from the outside. Inside, the place looks like a fancy log cabin. Its similar to a lot of the summer houses people have back in Russia. At night, they've got what appears to be Russian MTV playing on the flat screen TVs and an older guy that comes out to sing some songs on a small stage. He alternates with another lady. Throw in an occasional accordion and you're pretty much set as far as the entertainment is concerned. Occasionally some of the older guests will get up and start dancing in the open area right in front of the stage. Once things get going, they've got music playing nonstop and the atmosphere is pretty lively. I'd say at least 90% of the customers either are or with a Russian present, so it may be a little weird if you're one of the few loner Americans.\n\nI haven't tried everything on the menu but some of the food is pretty rich and I can see how it wouldnt be for everyone. The kabobs and the fried potatoes are pretty straightforward but delicious.  Again, I remember making and eating these as a kid at bbq's in the summer. \n\nWhen you first sit down at the table, the waitress brings out a couple of complimentary shots. Horse radish vodka for the men and cranberry stuff for the women. The horseradish vodka is worth trying if only  to say that you've had it.  This isn't your girlfriends cosmo. Try it. If you hate it don't get it again. If you like it (I did and have had the pleasure of getting plastered off this stuff on several occasions), this is the only place I know where you can order it. Enjoy. Baltica, the Russian beer, is pretty good as well. I've had a hard time finding it in southern california so its always a treat ordering it in Vegas.\n\nThe only real complaint about this place is that you get typical Russian service. A lot of times it'll be slow as hell or you'll get some older russian lady talking to you with a straight face. Trying to get a smile out of her will be like hammering nails into the wall with your bare hand - Pointless and quite possibly unpleasant. \n\nThat said, every time i'm in LV I try to make time to visit this place.

We'd been to Eliseevsky, the previous restaurant in this location, several years ago; it was mostly unmemorable, and what memories did stick were not wholly positive.\n\nWe went last night around 8:00 pm. The place is not easy to find, even having been to this location before; it's in a tiny shopping center at the corner of Flamingo and Decatur, tucked into a corner with no visible signage. I really hope they put up a more visible indicator of some kind, because more people need to know about this place.\n\nWe entered the restaurant to find a giant party of 30 taking up most of the place (they were a school organization of some kind, we think). After a moment, the waiter greeted us and told us to take any table we'd like. He was back a few moments later with menus and a preemptive apology; he was the only waiter on duty and, clearly, there was a party of 30 sitting across the dining room. We started to worry--obviously, we are not this guy's big tip for the evening. This turned out to be unnecessary. Throughout the meal, our waiter was friendly and attentive. I would have been happy with out visit even if the food were not so good simply because of the service.\n\nEven though we had a pretty good idea what we wanted to eat, he went through the menu with us, talking about which dishes were \"very Russian\" and making some suggestions. We ordered blinchiki to share ($7.95) and a couple of soft drinks. My fianc\u00e9e ordered the beef stroganoff ($16.95) with buckwheat and I ordered the shashlik ($15.95). The waiter brought out some bread for us while we waited for our food.\n\nNow, on to the food. The blinchiki gets you two crepes stuffed with either beef or mushroom, then lightly fried and dressed with sour cream. They were a little oily, but not unpleasantly so, as we were expecting that to some extent. The brightness of the sour cream nicely balanced the rich fatty beef. My fiancee has had blinchiki before and says they were much smaller and less oily, but she had these from a Russian home cook, not a restaurant. We agreed that they were delicious, in any case.\n\nNext up were the entrees. The stroganoff was a delight--tiny pieces of beef and mushroom and onion stewed together until tender with a rich, sour cream-based sauce. This ain't no midwestern egg-noodle disaster, either (who ever thought that was a good idea?). The buckwheat was perfectly cooked and incredibly aromatic. The plate comes with a small side of vegetable, a red bell pepper salad with rosemary and (I think?) vinegar. The veggies were crisp and the combination, while unexpected, was delicious. The shashlik was tender and very well prepared, if a touch overcooked; however, I'd rather be safe than sorry when it comes to pork. This plate was replete with vegetables, from fresh tomato to boiled cabbage, shaved onion, cucumber, and stewed tomato. There was some of that red pepper salad, as well. \n\nWe finished off the meal with a piece of \"Praga\" cake and a Turkish coffee, both excellent. The cake is firm and nutty, with a buttery rich frosting. They make it fresh in-house, as they do with all of their desserts. \n\nLooking at this review, I can't help but feel that I'm leaving something out, despite the length. However, it's a lot of words to say something very simple: I can't wait to go back.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 6, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I'll admit I don't know much about the \"Russian Soul\", but I do know about Russian hospitality. And this place has it in spades. \n\nI'm finishing off the remaining morsels leftover from the other night and recalling all the fabulous elements that make this place memorable. \n\nOne of the main tenets that I work off of is that an ethnic restaurant be authentic to the culture and the foods. Once it goes Americanized, it quickly loses its' luster. And when we walked in, I admit to being baffled. Of course we were greeted amiably. Of course the atmosphere was a bit mind-boggling. Of course the pink walls had me flinching. \n\nBut then I was quickly put at ease as the owner gave us the direct, but friendly explanation of the name and some of the reasons why the decor was so unique ( I'll leave you to discover for yourself these pieces of history and commerce ). Just suffice it to say that it all makes sense. \n\nA side note on the owner. I'm quite used to going to places where the owner snaps his fingers and has some lackey or another do his bidding. But here, the athletic and graceful owner is a one-man juggling crew. And ladies, he's not only charming but single. He even graciously overlooked many of my cultural faux pas, as my darling wife pointed out. More on those later. \n\nThe menu is simple and offered in Cyrillic as well as English ( perhaps he was being generous in that my beardling resembles Lenin's, in a way ). But for all its' simplicity it begs one to try every item. \n\nWe started with the Herring. Excellent. Fresh and lightly oiled, this never came out of a can. I think I still have the fork wounds were my otherwise calm wife and I did a fencing routine for every forkful. I could have eaten three or four of these and been very content. \n\nHere's where I committed my unpardonable sin. There was maybe a bite and a half full of potatoes left and when he asked if I'd like to finish them off, I passed, saying there was plenty of food coming. I saw him wince. And my wife discreetly pointed out that waste is not looked kindly upon. I was sheepishly awash with guilt. And vowed not to duplicate my crime.\n\nThe entrees were picture perfect displays often seen in tourist guides at Russian tour sites. I even snapped a few pictures which are available for your viewing. The Hungarian goulash was fork-cutting tender. The Liver was perfect: smooth and tasting of iron. It was generously portioned and served with Buckwheat. The only complaint was that the grilled onions weren't so plentiful to smother each bite appropriately. All the veggies were splayed like pickled flowers. I imagined a Babushka swaddled in Russian garb slaving over the kettles and stoves and pickling jars. \n\nA note on the pickling: all the items were fresh and crisp and not over-marinated as happens at places serving like fare. This is very important.\n\nAlso, order the Kvas. A non alcoholic wheated beverage that is like baby beer but chockfull of unfiltered goodness. His liquor license is pending, so bring your own potato vodka if you wish. \n\nDesert was a chocolate cake that was so layered and full of textures and levels that it would make a nun come. Enough said. Guys, use this as an aphrodisiac once you have enough vitamins in your system to keep up. \n\nWe ordered the soup to go and ate it the next day. It was so full of cabbage and assorted vegetables and beautifully flavored broth we would have ordered a gallon jug if they sold it that way. This is food that will put meat on the bones and see you through many a cold winter. \n\nYou might know me as somewhat of a curmudgeon, but I'm completely taken by the wholesomeness and charm of this place. My only spot of distraction was that the Russian music was quite enjoyable, but once a more American hint of top 40 hit the airwaves, the ambiance weakens quite a bit. So hint at how the the Russian themed music is a good thing to the owner and you'll not be distracted. \n\nI'm going to this place many times in the future. I just hope if gets the following it deserves. So if you want authentic Russian cuisine, then flock here before another shitty Americanized restaurant packs in the local yokels.

The Chicken Kiev, however, was... boring.  Overbreaded, it was slicing into a rock (and they don't give you a serrated knife, which would be helpful - instead they warn you about possible burns from spurting hot butter).  It was bland, with virtually no flavor whatsoever.  The best part of the meal was the \"fries\" that came with it - julienne strips of potato with dill and an addictive oily sauce.  Hubby tasted his mashed potatoes that came with his Shashlik and that was the only bite he ate of them.. but he kept stealing potatoes from my plate.\n\nWith tip, we paid about $85 for a meal for two that wasn't worth half that.\n\nOverall description.. tacky, boring, bland.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "First, let me preface by saying that I grew up in Ukraine and know what Russian cuisine should be like.
