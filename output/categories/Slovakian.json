The service was meh. The waitress appeared to have better things to do than serve food. Which I will get to later....\n\nI ate the Goulash and it was fantastic. One of my daughters ordered perogies with potatoe salad and of course I tasted the salad, it was pretty good. She enjoyed her perogies as well. My other daughter ordered sausage with potatoe salad.. I tested her salad too.. Just to be sure :)\n\nYep the food was good. While we were there the waitress was a little snippy and hey we all have our off days so whatever... But the best part was when the waitress got into it with another customer over the amount of ice in the coke. I watched and listened as the customer complained about how much ice was in her coke and the waitress got all annoyed. It was like I was in some sort of movie. I ate and listened. It was very entertaining to watch.\n\nSo long story short... Don't expect great service but the food and prices are great. If you want to have some side entertainment just piss the waitress off and watch....

I've been twice so far and both times, I've been super happy with my meals. \n\nThis time I went, I told them I was allergic to dairy and he said he'd make sure that the schnitzel used only an egg wash, instead of their usual egg and milk wash. He also listed off the ingredients in the (apparently homemade) caesar dressing (mayo, red wine vinegar, fresh garlic.. lemon?) so I would be sure I was good to go. \n\nMy friend also made things difficult because she can't eat pork, so she went for the chicken option at $2.50 extra. When the food came, she suspected that she actually got pork, and the server swooped in and said 'I think we made a mistake, let me take this away and we'll remake your whole meal.\" So she got that back in a few minutes, everything hot and freshly made. He then told us we'd be getting an apple strudel on the house for the mistake. I love how proactive they were about the whole thing. She didn't even have to say anything. \n\nService was excellent the entire time. The guy was very friendly and personable, and the food came out pretty quickly, considering it was definitely freshly made (no frozen schnitzels!)  I had the Vienna schnitzel with pig tail and my friend had the metro schnitzel (stuffed with bacon and sauerkraut). Tasty as hell. The pig tail was okay. Not a ton of meat, just a lot of fat. Tasted like pork. I LOVED the home fries, which are actually roasted potatoes with a bit of sauce on them. Addictive. \n\nThe meal was more than enough, I basically ate half of it and will be enjoying the remainder for lunch today. A full plate of food + caesar salad + garlic bread = $18.\n\nParking's out back. They also have a small party room with it's own bar at the back of the restaurant.

Once we were sat down, he was very pleasant and attentive throughout our visit. \n\nI ordered the Cordon Bleu Schnitzel with home fries and coleslaw. It was very clear that everything was home made and absolutely delicious. The portions are huge, and there was tons of cheese and ham in the centre of the schnitzel. I only barely managed to finish it!  My one friend isn't a fan of pork, but they have a chicken option - great to see they're accommodating! \n\nThe restaurant itself is very homey, it almost feels like you're going to someone's place for dinner. The art on the walls was super kitchy and cute, which really added to the atmosphere.

Parisian is by far my favourite - lots of cheese, yummy mushrooms, and pairs well with the home fries. As well for dinner, you get soup or salad, as well as the two sides to go with your schnitzel.
