I noticed on the way out however that during the day you can order a meal and they'll cook it there, however no one was back near the kitchen when i was there and it looked closed.\nNext time i come here i will try and hydrate myself a little better so that im not ready to faint on the employees.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "This grocery store reminds me of the nice specialty Asian grocery stores in San Francisco you might find around Japantown (except this is the Korean version of course).

That's the niche this store fills.  So even if its small, it's invaluable to people like me in the Tempe area. \n\nThe store also has a great little cafe in the back by the prepared foods.  It is a small counter cafe, that is attached to the kitchen.  As you can see from the photos, it doesn't seem like much.  But you will not regret ordering from here.  You can have your meal to go or eat it at the counter.  I like to eat it at the counter.  It's not the same as eating at one of those street-stall cafes in Seoul, but it's a suitable substitution given the circumstances.  The menu is limited, but they serve many of the good old Korean comfort foods. \n\nMy husband had the beef BBQ plate, I had the spicy pork BBQ plate, and we both split a pot of Kimchi Jigae.  They were all very good.  I might even say they were better than the same served at any of the three Korean restaurants I had listed as my top three:  Chodang, Hadori, and Takamatsu.  My spicy pork BBQ was flavorful.  The perfect balance of sweetness, saltiness, and spiciness that you should expect in such a dish.  My husband also enjoyed his beef BBQ.  One of the best he has ever had, he said.  Our kimchi jjgae was also very good.  Served piping hot with loads of kimchi, beef, and tofu.  We didn't get an egg, but I think they will add one for you if you ask for it.  We also received a complimentary serving of japche.  I was told that they usually serve some banchan to their guests but they ran out, so we got japche instead.  Although it was good, with a nice amount of veggies and beef, it was the least favorite of the dishes we had.  I'm not a big fan of japche in general and the noodles were a bit hard, which is what happens when it gets too cold or is undercooked.  \n\nOur total came out to around $34, including drinks.  So, the prices are a couple of bucks or so cheaper than similar items from Chodang, Hadori, and Takamatsu. Which is pretty good considering the quality and flavor is, in my opinion, a bit better.\n\nThe process of ordering and paying for your meal is a bit confusing if you're a first-timer.  So, here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1) When you get to the counter, it might look closed even if it is not.  I think it's the curtains that might throw people off.  They are always closed (hanging), even when the cafe is open.  The purpose I think is to cover some of the view of the kitchen from the outside.  So, just look for the lady or gentleman that works there or ask the person at the front check-out when you come in if the cafe is open.    \n\n2)You order with the lady or gentleman working in the kitchen that the counter is attached to.  If they are busy, just take a seat and get their attention.  Dont worry about being rude.  Koreans are pretty straight forward people.  If you need something, you just ask for it.  I know it's very counter intuitive for Americans regarding service, but if you can get over that, then you 'll be fine.  Get your own chopsticks from the container on the counter, but you will be provided with a spoon.\n\n3) There are cups on the counter and cold water is off to the right of the counter.  The water is self serve.  If you want a different kind of beverage (soda, tea, etc.) or even some of their prepared foods that are off to the side, you just go and grab what you want from the store.  You can pay for it then (keep your receipt) or you can pay for it at the end of your meal.  Just don't forget to pay for it. \n\n4) The servings are huge.  So, if you need to-go boxes, ask for them.  They will happily provide you with what you need.   \n\n5) Towards the middle or end of your meal you will be given a ticket with your order on it.  It will be written in Korean so unless you know how to read Korean you won't have a clue what it states.  But the number of things on this list should be the same as the number of things you ordered, not including your drinks.  \n\n6) Take the ticket along with your drinks (empty cans if you are done drinking them) to the front check out.  That's where they will ring everything up and you pay for it.\n\nAll-in-all, this is a great little store and the a great little cafe for a quick and delicious Korean meal.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Stopped by again for  another quick, late lunch.\n\nHad the spicy squid with some banchan (soy beef, radish kimchi, and seasoned bean sprouts).

They have all the requisite korean fruits and veggies for authentic cuisine. Occasionally some of the pre-packed fruits (like peaches) and veggies (like cucumbers) might be alittle old and have some mold on them, so I always try to inspect what I buy. I feel like it's more a problem with being wrapped up tight in plastic and styrofoam b/c the items that are freestanding always appear very fresh.\n\nThe meat department is small but serviceable. You won't find a large variety of cuts here, but for standard korean bbq items, and for making soups you can find what you want. Again, probably a little pricier than at other asian markets. \n\nThe dry, refrigerated, and frozen goods are pretty standard and you can find all the things you could possibly need for making korean food from scratch, or a lot of instant/premade foods that just need heating up or minimal preparation. The only thing that selection seems a little week on are beverages. Kimchi is always plentiful and offer a good variety of types of jarred kimchi, or kimchi in bags\n\nThe food stand serves up truly homemade Korean food, like what you would get at home..certainly homier than what you would get in a standard Korean restaurant. No bells and whistles, just hot tasty food straight up. \n\nBut to me the real strength of this market is their premade banchan - or those freebie side dishes you're always offered at Korean restaurants that act as appetizers? There's a really wide variety of ban chan available, and although the small packages seems a little expensive ($3-5 each), if you know how much time it takes to prepare each individual side dish...it's well worth the price to buy them already made. Sides like soy sauced beef & egg are usually hard to find in korean markets, so it's a huge bonus this place does it well. In the pre-prepared section are also huge packs of pre-marinated bulgogi, and other kimchi preparations. Also, you can find freshly made kimbap (korean sushi rolls), and occasionally other warm items like savory korean pancakes. Even if you don't cook korean food, you can buy a bunch of these items and have a full korean meal at home, and some of it is actually better than my mom's.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "They have kimchi potstickers now!

Sometimes the goods are competitively prices but the produce is always fresh and some things that can't be found at other Asian markets like Lee Lee, can be found here-- and example is perilla leaves.\nThere are other great things I can say, but over all it's a great place.\nThe only reason it's three stars is because the prices aren't competitive.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "There is a new cook in the kitchen and the menu has changed a little bit.

They have a refrigerated section that has an assortment of banchan as well as marinated meats ready to grill; my friend Jan who happened to be in the market at the same time that I was shopping there was able to grab the last of the marinated ready-to-cook beef short ribs ahead of me, so I'll have to come back another day for that. Tucked in a corner of the store is a small eatery - a table for 4 and a counter that seats about 6 - that serves a short list of Korean entrees. I was hoping to try the spicy squid which the other reviewers were raving about but it was no longer in the menu, so I tried the spicy beef instead; it was a tasty stick-to-the-ribs meal, especially with the kimchi and spicy beansprout sides that came with it.  Apparently they had shortened the menu and raised the prices a buck since the last reviews that mentioned the eatery, so that the meat entrees cost a penny short of 10 bucks. In all, I find this a pleasant place to buy Asian groceries and grab a quick and hearty Korean meal.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Great food in the little kitchen in the back.
