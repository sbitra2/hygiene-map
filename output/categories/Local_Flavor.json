And I tried to like the old one (near Bristo Square). But at that one I ordered a falafel salad. The falafel was so dry I had to order coke to go with it (I never drink coke), but then as one of the servers walked by she knudged by coke with her hip and it spilled into my falafel salad. She just looked behind her, muttered \"oh oops\" and didn't offer anything, even help to clean it up, let alone more dry falafel.\n\nSo with that memory of the old Forest Cafe as the only comparison point I had for the new one, I went along here when it first opened to meet a friend. I admit, I like the space. It's on a corner, all glass, near the Meadows but overlooking Tollcross. They've done a nice job of decorating the ground outside with chalk patterns.\n\nIt's probably worth knowing that I went through a two year 'hippy' phase in my youth / pre-teens. I listened exclusively to music pre-1980, wore vintage levis flares, watched the 70s version of Jesus Christ Superstar on a monthly basis, wore tie dye, started a school World Wildlife Fund group, started donating money to save the gorillas. (I didn't say I did the hippy phase very well. It's a sliding scale. I still washed, shaved, and worked.)\n\nAnyway. I have a nostaligic love of all things eco-hippy. I still engage in more spiritual matters -I practice yoga, I try to meditate, I still do my bit to help endangered animals, I use ecover products where possible. But I've grown out of my dreadlock-crush and the 'image' of it all. Because really it is an image.\n\nI'm not trying to bash on anyone. All I'm saying is, I should in theory love the Forest Caf\u00e9. The idea of it appealed to my inner eco-warrior. \n\nBut when I found it cold, the tables dirty, and as Peter S also said, serving cold coffee with very non-engaging or friendly staff, you realise that whilst some things are nice in theory, when it comes to running a business and serving customers, there's certain standards that you just shouldn't let slip. Like smiling. Or serving coffee in clean cups.\n\nI *might* give it another go. Their advertised mexican coffee sounds good. And it's got more romance than the previous venue.
