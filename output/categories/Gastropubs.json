My friend ordered the Cuban Pork Sandwich with the hand-cut fries, while I got the Craftsman Burger and substituted the hand-cut fries for sweet potato fries. If you are in the market for some protein&carbs, you really can't go wrong with either. \n\nThe Craftsman Burger was a basic bacon and cheese burger. I asked for it medium well, and it came out perfectly juicy - I think if I'd gone with medium it would have been a little too undercooked for my liking. I'm a huge fan of sharp cheddar, so I really appreciated that component of the burger as well. \n\nThe Cuban Sandwich was delicious as well. They were certainly very generous with the meat and pickles, and I loved the combo of the hot/cold deli meats! :9 I must say that the Craftsman's Cuban is one of the best I've ever had. \n\nThe sweet potato fries were another highlight of the meal. If you are already planning on taking the...less healthy route (fries instead of greens), you might as well substitute the regular fries (which looked like strips of fried potato skin) for a mound of sweet potato fries. You will regret it later when you need to loosen your belt by a couple of notches, but it's wellll worth it!  \n            \nThe portions were ridiculously huge and neither the sandwich nor the burger should have been consumed by any one individual, but we were famished so we had an excuse (yea right).

It's not too loud of a place (at least on a Tuesday night) to foster intimate conversation. \n\nFor dinner I followed the menu's guidance (and then asked Wally himself). Chicken Vesuvius is w-o-n-d-e-r-f-u-l! Chicken medallions, artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, 'cider' smoked bacon (HOH MY) with plenty of herbs and spices. My meal was served with a hearty portion of salad and (HOH MY) horse radish mashed potatoes.\n\n1) The chicken was cooked to perfection. Not a hint of dryness!\n2) The chicken wasn't bathed in oil. That sounds like a terrible way to describe it, but, I didn't feel like I was tossing a gym session out the window. \n\nThat being said, note that portions are on the very [very] generous side. I took 2/3rd of it home.\n\nRight. So about Wally, the impeccable service and a delightful experience... Let's see...Our server described the specials with such delight that I only wished I was going off menu. But no! I wanted something \"regular\" on the menu. Wally was incredibly helpful in helping this first timer navigate the full menu. (Alas, the house was out of the nightly special of ribs.) Wally has a comedic sense of timing. Watch out!\n\nOk, so what's the deal with Wally's fantastic beard? Were you thinking Ernest Hemingway? Why yes! In fact, Wally and his son enter a contest every year for the best E.

I did not feel like it lived up to the rave reviews but it was good enough to bring me back to enjoy some food and drink with an old friend.  That time I had ordered their shrimp cocktail while I waited for my friend to arrive, I was starving! As I was eating, the owner (I assume) came up to introduce himself and asked if I live in the area (most of the patrons do)...as I turned back towards the bar to eat my very last jumbo shrimp, the Katie Perry look alike grabbed my food and dumped it in the trash! She never even asked if I was finished. I asked her if she decided that I was done eating and then she asked if I wanted another shrimp from the kitchen but I felt awkward at that point and told her no. She still brought me one lonely shrimp on a huge plate with no cocktail sauce. The sauce is what makes the shrimp cocktail. My friend and I then ordered their spinach dip.  The dip was brought out and as the plate was lowered to the bar, my chips were sliding off onto the bar and she just scooped them back on to the plate. I personally was not thrilled about that. I scooped some spinach up on to my dirty chip, blew on it a little and took a bite. This dip was the hottest (heat wise) thing that I have ever had in my mouth. I would compare it to biting the rack in a broiler.  I was never warned that they heat their dip up so hot. I guarantee the work of a microwave! I burned myself so bad that my mouth was peeling and bleeding. It took over a week of peroxide rinses, colloidal silver rinses and salt water rinses to heal my mouth. My mouth is actually scarred inside! This burned me so terribly that my teeth were sore, my jaw hurt and even my sinuses on that side of my mouth hurt. When I stopped in to tell the brunette bartender about my burn and I advised that they should warn people about how hot they make it, she replied with \"Well, don't scarf your food down, let it cool first.\" Totally rude, offensive and bad customer service with a reply like that. That same night that I burned my mouth, my friend was using their hot sauce to spice up her chip and the bartender came over and started twisting the lid back on without asking if she was done and my friend had to stop her from taking it away. She clearly has issues with letting people finish their meal. When it came to the bill she had to ask us how many drinks we had because she wasn't keeping track... It seriously was not a lot of drinks to keep track of either. I think this place would be OK if it wasn't for this bartender. I did order a salad on a separate occasion (when I warned her about the hot dip) and that proved to be disappointing as well, way too much dressing and she kept giving me a hard time for not drinking during my work hour.

She forgot things (like a salad) and started invoking \"new rules\" about taking more than 3 credit cards for a group (even though equally split). She also lectured us on how she would apply the Wally's dicount card. It wasn't so much about the money, it was about the awful way she made us feel. If they want to discontine the discount cards, do it - don't come up with a bunch of arbitrary rules at the last minute... that just ruins things. \nWally's faces new competition in the neighborhood and if they want to stay in business they need to focus on service and keeping their long standing clients happy. The food is never the BEST or  WORST in the valley but the local feel and comfortable service are the big draw. Without that, there is no reason to go there. \nAlthough we've eaten at Wally's at least once per week for more than 5 years, sadly, it will be quite some time before we return.

Then we ordered our main courses. I ordered the Ribbon Pasta with shrimp on the side and my friends ordered the steak salad. When our food arrived my friend's were brought JUST steaks, but since my pasta arrived at the same time my friends said they would just suck it up and eat the steaks. One bit of my Ribbon Pasta and I wanted to vomit! I had my friend try it to confirm and she completely agreed. Since my friends didn't even want actual steaks we decided it would be best to send it all back. The waiter that came over (Mike) was so amazing. He said No problem and would bring me something else off the menu and my friends what they actually ordered. 5min later the food runner came over and told me that \"since nothing was actually wrong with your food we are going to have to charge you for both meals\". I was in complete shock and immediately asked for the manager. 5min later she then comes back and told me \"the manager does not want to come out and fight with me out here\" when I responded with \"nobody wants to fight I just want to address the issue so he needs to come out here and chat with me\"  2min later she comes out and says \"he will not come out and talk to you cause he does not want to fight\".

The mac and cheese was hot and cheesy- it was everything you could want in a standard mac and cheese. The Hubs had the chicken two ways and has been talking about it days later, so I guess he liked it! Everyone gobbled up the two desserts we shared- the chocolate cake and the cobbler. I was too stuffed to try the cake, but sampled the cobbler and I thought it was pretty good. \n\nAll in all, I was quite pleased with this experience at TK's. The first time I wasn't impressed at all and really didn't want to go back a second time, but I'm glad we did... hopefully they can stay busy since it seems like restaurants are dropping like flies in the area.

SMALL food.  Listen...I understand small portions with high prices.  However, if you're doing that, the food better be f-ing good and it typically isn't served in a \"tavern\".

They aren't perfect, but come darn close (when will Yelp give us the option of the half star?!) and come in at 4.5 stars.  The menu is thoughtful and small, so they do a few dishes and they do them well (do you hear that Cheesecake Factory?).  I have had the roasted beet and goat cheese salad (large salad), which was divine. My only critique is that there needs to be a little more goat cheese and dressing, otherwise the arugula ends up dry, and nobody wants that.  It also could use just a tad bit more complexity (it's only ingredients are arugula, toasted almonds, beets, goat cheese and dressing) so I would ask to add tomatoes for some acidity.  I've also had the roasted Scottish salmon, with a bed of vegetables.  That salmon is darn good and those vegetables are a medley of perfection!  I would ask for just an order of the veggies if I could!  I've also had the cavatelli pasta (short rib, oven dried tomatoes, spinach, gnocchi, and a yummy sauce). The gnocchi is a great touch and the tomatoes are exceptional (I never eat oven dried tomatoes because they are always chewy--these are soft, without being mushy and so tasty, I almost asked for a plate to eat alone).  The only negative is that the braised short rib was a little dry the night I had it, but I bet it was just an off-night.  The french fries are out of this world!!!  They keep the skins on and they don't oversalt them (they also have homemade ketchup that's pretty good).  The pork sandwich is also an excellent choice.  The ricotta beignets are two thumbs up!  Imagine little doughnut holes covered in dark chocolate.  It's not too heavy or sweet.  The prices are just a little high (if you were anywhere else in Phoenix or Scottsdale, every dish would probably be $1 or $2 less) but considering that this place is in Scottsdale Quarter, the prices are a steal.  Everyone that I have ever encountered here is extremely nice and the bartenders that have served me have all been great.

The house onion gravy that accompanied it was separated by the time it came tableside. The sandwich was completely devoid of any flavor.  My daughter went with the grilled cheese. On paper, a combo of muenster and cheddar with a roasted garlic spread sounds solid, but sadly this isn't paper and the sandwich was nothing to write home about.

My son has a weekly tutoring appointment in the same shopping center, so when his Wednesday session rolled around this week I decided to check out Spitfire, figuring a cold beer would beat waiting for a hour in the car outside.\n\nWhat a lucky decision!  Spitfire really impressed me tonight and proved that it's more than just your typical neighborhood beer bar.\n\nThe atmosphere is small, calm and uncluttered.  A few TVs in the bar and one in the dining room were on, but without sound which was nice.\n\nMy bartender Brendan was friendly, knowledgeable, and recommended a great beer for me (Grand Canyon American Pilsner, which is brewed in Williams but which I had never tried before).  When I asked a question about their beers he hauled out a big binder with information on every beer they carry.\n\nI decided to have my family join me there for dinner.  The service was fast, friendly and -- again -- knowledgeable and able to make recommendations about the food.  Even though this was their first night open, everything went smoothly for us.\n\nWhen the food came, we were blown away.  We had expected reasonably good \"bar food\", although the menu definitely showed some aspiration to better things.  We started with the Crispy Calamari, accompanied by a really unique sweet citrus chili dipping sauce that was light, not too sweet and with just the right amount of heat -- delicious.\n\nFor entrees we chose the Diver Scallops with Asian Slaw and a White Soy Mushroom Sauce (incredible), the All-Natural Beef Bistro Tender (cooked perfectly) and the Green Tea Noodles with Miso Broth (delicious and plentiful).  All exceeded our expectations.\n\nThe owner stopped by during dinner, as did a number of other staff members, to see how we were doing.  Our server, Nikki, was delightful.\n\nAll in all we were very pleasantly surprised and so happy to have another high-quality, casual and comfortable restaurant in our area -- especially one with 18 beers on tap and many others available.\n\nSpitfire Grill is using Twitter (@spitfiregrill) and Facebook to promote themselves, and I'd encourage East Valley folks to follow, friend and enjoy what they have to offer.

I found both of these restaurants to be really repulsive lending to the idea that the location might be jinxed, but nevertheless we gave Spitfire Grill a try and I'm glad we did. We love to support local businesses and Spitfire Grill is easy to love! This place could easy be one of my top five favorite restaurants and the fact that it's within walking distance from my house is a total bonus. This neighborhood desperately needed a locally owned, non-chain restaurant to liven up the area. \n\nThey've completely changed the interior from the garish and tacky Sign of the Whale \"maritime decor\" with nets and plastic lobsters to a cool, modern, rustic southwestern decor. Faux finished walls, iron candelabras and dim lighting really make the atmosphere pretty posh for a tavern. Even though it's a \"grill\" per se, the ambiance is nice enough that it could easily be a date night place, it's the most elegant looking \"bar\" for miles around that's for sure.\n\nFirst of all they give you complimentary spicy paprika hummus with cracker bread. I love freebies and I especially love them when they taste that incredible. The waitress said they make everything in house. The hummus was exceptional...and free. We started with a cup of the butternut squash soup which was finished with molasses. It looked boring but tasted spectacular! I was surprised how much flavor and appeal it had for as drab as it looked. I would definitely order that again. We also had the flat bread with goat cheese, mushrooms and caramelized onions. I was a little surprised that it had tomato sauce on it, for some reason I didn't imagine the goat cheese would taste good with that but it did. The actual flat bread itself, whatever type of dough it was made out of was light and delicious. As far as that particular flavor pairing, I probably wouldn't order that again even though it was tasty and I did eat all of it! \n\nFor lunch I ordered the Cuban sandwich. I love, love, love Cuban sandwiches when they are done well. My favorite is from Mimita's Cuban Cafe and my least favorite is from Culinary Dropout in Scottsdale. So now that I've tried Spitfire's Cuban it's my NEW favorite. It's not traditional, it's a more modern take on it. I love that instead of sliced ham, which is usually lunch meat at most places, that they used Serrano ham which is basically Spain's version of prosciutto. Delicious. Then there was pulled pork and sweet house made pickles. The surprising part was some kind of avocado spread, not usually on a Cuban but worked really well. The whole thing was panini pressed and the bread was fabulous. Now on to the french fries. Oh my. The waitress said they were fried in rice oil which is supposed to be healthier for you. I'm not sure how it could be healthy when they taste so incredible. They appeared to be either batter dipped fries or twice fried fries, not sure, but they had exceptional crunch and flavor. I'd like to have a double order of the fries next time!\n\nMy friend had the tuna panini but I didnt' taste it, however it looked really good and she said she love it. \n\nLast but not least we had one of their homemade desserts. Cranberry peach cobbler with cinnamon ice cream. It came out in a little cast iron skillet. It was a pretty traditional cobbler/crumble, the topping was really nice, some type of oats and brown sugar concoction. I felt like the peaches may have been frozen, but it did not detract from the enjoyment of the dessert and I don't believe peaches are in season right now anyway. Next time I'd like to try their bread pudding.                                   \n\nSo why do I like this place???  It's a couple blocks from my house, I'm sure locals will be packing in there in no time. They use natural meats, hormone, steroid and antibiotic free meats and even have an organic burger on the menu. I like that because I only buy meats that meet that criteria anyway and it's near impossible to find that when dining out. They use local produce and products as much as possible and it's not a chain!!! The biggest reason I love it is because there's FINALLY a good restaurant in this neighborhood where everyone seems to have the palette of a 90 year old nursing home patient. How Marcello's has stayed in business right across the street is amazing to me. They should start worrying because this place is 10000 times better. \n\nOh yeah, almost forgot, since I'm pregnant and not drinking I didn't really get into it but apparently they have like a couple dozen beers on tap, most of them from local breweries.

Guac was pretty standard (nothing can beat the guac @ Barrio Cafe!) but the pita chips were delicious and a nice compliment to the guac. As for entrees, my friend ordered a salad (I think it was the Arugula & Frise\u00e8 with Pecans, Tart Green Apples, Gorgonzola & a White Balsamic & Fig Dressing) which was apparently great as my friend was not willing to share! : ) I enjoyed the Herb-Roasted Turkey Panini on Ciabatta with Cranberry Mustard, Grilled Green Apple & Camembert with Local Craft Beer-Battered Onion Rings. The sandwich was... well good... not great... but good. I felt like it was missing something. You know... that oomph that makes it memorable! It melded together nicely but just didn't put me over the edge and with those tasty ingredients I wanted it to be much better! I digress; the onion rings were WONDERFUL... light, crispy, not greasy and well seasoned. I should mention that I did ask for a side of the House Tomato Jam... (had never had it so I was curious!) Don't bother... it was lackluster... basically canned tomatoes with no flavor. Not sure what I expected but it wasn't that! \n\nI passed on dessert but my friend did have some of the sorbet which was OK. The lemon is REALLY lemony (which I liked) but my friend felt it was a little too much. The mango tasted like fresh mango (yum!). The final scoop was a Cabernet based sorbet... it was interesting and although I do love a good cab this was definitely an acquired taste. \n\nService was good overall, helpful, provided suggestions and answered questions although was a bit too much about the up-sell for my taste. \nI was a little thrown off by the busser who would sneak up from the opposite side to fill the water but maybe that's just me. \n\nDecor and dining area is very comfortable and there is outdoor seating.

So light and yummy! \n\nFor an entree, I ordered the Cobb Salad of Iceberg, Romaine, Applewood Bacon, Avocado, House-Dried Tomatoes, Roasted Corn, Queso Fresco & Roasted Jalape\u00f1o Ranch sans the bacon (no pork for me!) with the dressing on the side. I was feeling somewhat indecisive when it came to which dressing so between myself and one of the other girls we asked for their three different types on the side. The salad was pretty standard... nothing really exciting here. As for the dressings: Jalepeno Ranch: good flavor... probably best described as a runny ranch with a kick. Walnut Vinaigrette: Not what I expected in a vinaigrette... Thick! Flavor was kind of bland... Just not a fan of this one. White Balsamic & Fig Dressing: was excited to try this one since one of the girls really liked this one. Again this one was thick! OK flavor... definitely would probably be better already tossed in the salad and not on the side. \n\nEach of decided that the food was OK... Not spectacular but decent. \n\nThe service however was excellent! Our server, Bob was friendly, attentive and offered excellent service. Probably more impressively he put up with us and our craziness that some times occurs when we get together for girl talk! ;) He was the highlight of the experience! \n\nOverall, I have to say... I have concerns on whether this place will be around for long... We were there on a Friday evening from about 5:30 until about 7:30 and can say that they were not very busy. When we left there was only two other tables and maybe 2 people in the bar area hanging out with the people that worked there... \n\nHere's hoping that they figure it out... love the atmosphere of the place and would hate to see another restaurant go under in this location.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "This place is trying way too hard.

This came in handy with all of the snow everyone and the cold making it so we didn't want to walk to fair.\nWe started with some tea and coffee because, even though it was lunch, it was our first meal of the day and we both wanted to wake up and warm up a bit.

There was a bit of lemon that gave it such a nice brightness and there was lot of crab in the three crab cakes. Perfect for a sharable lunch appetizer.\nThe executive chef actually came out to clear plates and see how things were going. When we mentioned the lemon to him, he perked up and really seemed to enjoy the feedback. He asked if they were good enough for us to come back for and we agreed they were.\nI had the grilled cheese which was grilled cheese with bacon and apple jam on some delicious, crunchy, Madison Sourdough. How could you go wrong? The flavors were all so perfectly balanced and I was actually able to taste each of the ingredients. They played well together. For a side, I got the fries and smoked paprika aioli sauce. They were absolutely fine and the sauce was tasty.\nMy husband had the Hereford beef burger with bacon and chevre. He actually thought the greens on top added a brightness to the salad-something he never thinks! He thought the tanginess of the chevre worked perfectly with the beef. He also got the fries, but opted for the wasabi aioli. It wasn't as spicy as we expected.\nAlso, since we had the discount, we opted for a couple of cocktails to warm us up. I had the infraRED which was a raspberry vodka martini and my husband had a Moscow mule. We both liked our drinks. They were well prepared, but nothing too fair out of the ordinary.\nThe prices were great and we'd definitely go back even without discounts. The appetizers were about $10.

They both advertised including goat cheese or chevre, but the amount on the salad was almost non-existent.  The beat salad boasted roasted beets, but they were served boiled.  The salads in general were small, given the price.  Presentation was perfect, but taste fell very flat.

The spinach and arugula were old, not fresh (had to pick out some brown and rotting pieces), and in general, the salad seemed sad and not at all lively.\n\nWe also ordered the beef shoulder with horseradish sauce, onion marmalade and potoato ($17.00).

But in truth, the service, cocktails and food have never really blown me away, and now tonight (after probably the worst experience I've had there) I feel like it's time I come clean Madison.\n \nI've never understood the greeting/seating situation. I understand it's a hotel lobby restaurant, informal in nature, but we stood for about 5 minutes tonight watching staffers pass us by before a bartender finally greeted us and told us to take a seat anywhere. In my opinion 5 minutes is 5 minutes too long to wait to acknowledge people who are about to spend money at your establishment. \n\nIt got worse. \n\nApparently they ran out of grapefruit juice and instead of asking the person I was dining with whether or not he wanted something else to drink as they couldn't make the cocktail he requested, they simply substituted cranberry juice. I don't feel like I need to expand but DO feel like anytime I run out of anything while cooking or preparing a libation, I will forever just add cranberry juice. \n\nThe red spread which I've had multiple times lacked flavor. Like... any flavor. It tasted like cold red paste. Not salty paste that you ate when you were a kid. Flavorless paste. \n\nThe meatloaf slider was ok, probably the highlight of our night, but the evening was so dismal that this highlight was more of a fading flicker. \n\nThe \"popped ravioli\" is where we lost it and felt cheated out of any sort of decent experience, cheated out of $14. I didn't really understand the dish as written on the menu. What arrived was a weird cross between a lasagna noodle and papardelle. Apparently \"popped\" ravioli means ravioli that hasn't been cut, squared, filled, folded... anything really. It's pasta with the insides that act more like a sauce than a filling. This dish would be better called \"lazy man's ravioli,\" or just \"pasta and sauce\" than popped ravioli which sounds mildly interesting. Do I sound crabby? I am. Am I being fair? I am. Because this like the red spread lacked any sort of flavor. The dish was supposed to have fire roasted eggplant and garlic and I only know that because I just looked at the menu online. You'd have no idea otherwise. The pasta dough needs to be rolled out flatter before it's cut, the noodles need more salt in the water, the sauce slash filling slash stuff that popped out needs anything... like vegetables, spice, cream, chicken broth... something, and the entire dish needs an anchor. It was disappointing and insanely priced given the fact that it doesn't have a protein.  \n\nThe most redeeming part of the evening was our server who admittedly wasn't great at his job, but he was trying.

Many generations of my family hail from Leith (my grand father was a Lindsay and his mother was a Leith), so spending a few days here was truly special. I was told to find this pub, as the property had some connection to my family (the details are a bit fuzzy... I should have paid more attention when my grandparents explained the association). We found it easily - almost by accident. It was just what I had pictured.  The building itself is very old - goes back hundreds of years.  The pub has two very, very small rooms, one for eating and drinking and another for drinking and darts.  Intimate (shoulder-to-shoulder) seating.  Brick walls.  Low ceiling.  Even a small fireplace at one end of the room we were in. We ordered fish, which was quite good. Seemed the safest thing on the menu [well, chalk board behind the bar] for a not so adventurous American. (Folks sitting next to us had haggis... I had to avert my eyes while they ate!) I don't know if this pub is normally frequented by tourists, but we were the only non-locals in the room the night we were there, which certainly added to the charm.  The atmosphere was relaxed and encouraged lingering... which we did. We whiled away the entire evening in fact, my hubby hefting pints of ale while I became acquainted with Balvenie - a single malt scotch whisky which is now my favorite. And our tab for the entire evening was under 30 pounds! Amazing. Our visit to Kings Wark is one of my favorite memories of our two weeks in GB.

After being seated and looking at the menu I was regretting my decision. I started thinking that maybe this was more a place for drinks and light bites rather than a full meal. It turns out I was very wrong but at first Hubby was also grumbling about the mention of \"small plates\" on the menu and the fact that most of the food and beer options sounded \"weird\". Well, unlike him I love trying new craft beers and I was very excited that they had a few offerings from Odell since I had just recently discovered this brewery at the Strong Beer festival. I ordered both their chocolate milk stout and their red ale and both of them were fantastic. Hubby ordered the Magic Hat hefe at my urging since I am also a fan of their beers (so excited that they have started distributing in our state now!). Our server was very familiar with the beer options which is a huge plus in my book since even though I am adventurous I do hate it when I end up with something that I don't like or doesn't go well with my meal.\n\nFor food, we started with the selection of three bruschetta and all of them were very tasty. The hubby's favorite was the wild mushroom which was so meaty in texture that I honestly thought there was some steak pieces in there until I went back and read the description before writing this review (yes, I do that). Heirloom Tomato bruschetta was typical combination of flavors you could find elsewhere but the tomatoes themselves were obviously heirloom and had an excellent flavor to them so that one was also a hit with us both. The hubby did not care for the goat cheese one but I loved it. Even though the cheese had a pleasant, mild flavor, it was piled pretty high. I actually turned to him after taking a bite and asked \"Do I have goat cheese on my nose?\" How often do you hear that? Even though each of the three selections only came with two pieces, they were all very hearty and flavorful. Instead of an entree, I decided to order the baby beet salad and the smoked tomato soup because they both sounded fantastic. I love tomato soup and have ordered it many places and this was definitely in the top 5. And it came with a small grilled cheese so even though it was on the menu as a starter it would make a nice light lunch. With the salad and bruschetta it was perfect amount of food for dinner. The hubby ordered the beef short rib with mushroom risotto. The waitress had warned him that it only came with one but there was A LOT of meat on it and he was really impressed with the flavor so he too was satisfied with his \"small plate\". All of the food was executed perfectly except that the beets in the salad were a little undercooked. I hate the mushy canned beets but I do think that fresh beets should still be cooked enough so that they can be cut with a fork. I mentioned this to the waitress only because she asked.... and I am an honest person.... but then right away the owner (I think?) was out at our table apologizing. I couldn't believe it; after sampling so many items that taste absolutely delicious and were presented so beautifully on the plate, just because one was not total perfection doesn't mean you have to apologize!! But it was a sweet gesture and I really appreciated that she took the time to make sure we were happy.\n\nSo, to sum up, the food and service were both fantastic. The only thing keeping this place from five stars is the price. I totally get that they are using quality ingredients and expressing some real creativity in the dishes and I love that. And I am perfectly willing to do the small plates because I value quality over quantity. However, I think our bill at the end of the night (about $60) was a little more than I should pay for a light dinner at a strip mall bistro which even thought it was tastefully decorated, had little ambiance. And I would love to come back for wine and snacks with the girls but I know my sister would not be willing to pay the $10-20 per glass that they were charging. They had a lot of unusual varietals from non-commercial wineries but the prices they charge are too high relative the bottle's retail price. I agree with the other reviewer that suggested they have some deeper discounts on wine and food (beer prices are great) for happy hour... then I would be back on girls' night for sure.

For a $20 entree a piece of fish and some lettuce is ridiculous. Muscles were ice cold and there were only about 10 in a big bowl so it looked horrible and instantly cooled off the muscles which had no garnish, barely any sauce and cold bread.

Not just sort of under cooked, were talking barely touched on the grill. Honestly, it happens no big deal! We kindly asked our server if we could get the fish cooked a little more and she happily agreed.

My sister was immediately embarrassed and felt horrible. Not how you want to be treated when spending over $200 on a meal. To add insult to injury it appears their method for fixing the issue was to get us a free $6 dessert that we had no intentions of ordering anyways. Gee thanks.

He was surprised to just see blue cheese crumbles on top. He thought there would be a delicious blue cheese sauce. If you are going to serve small plates, they need to be really thoughtful--sauces, salsas, relish--are a necessity to complete the protein! His meat was fatty throughout. At least he got some sort of chewy corn dish on the side, not just greens and greens. It was super chewy but flavorful. Probably the only thing we ate with a hint of flavor and seasoning.

As they just opened on Dec 31, 2011, they're definitely the new kids in town.\n\nThe reasons to rave about this place:\n-It's really cool.  The outside is cool, with wide open spaces to see into their bar, into their lush, comfy lounge, and the stunning oversize doors.  The attention to detail in the decor is evident. Large beer delivery tubes are great in the bar, the lounge has comfy couches and chairs with cute little pictures, knick-knacks, etc throughout, the dining room has awesome floors, great lighting, cool artwork, and awesome music playing, and the bathrooms are cute, with humorous messages on the walls ('Stay seated for the entire performance,' and, in the men's room by the urinal 'Stand closer. It's shorter than you think.').\n-Great place to watch a game. Lots of TVs, good energy, and a variety of watching areas (as there are TVs in the bar, lounge, and dining room).\n-Ridiculous selection. 20 or so beers on tap, cask ales, and hundreds (literally) of bottled and canned beers. \n-Service was awesome.  In the bar, for lunch, our bartender was friendly, offered recommendations, and gave us appropriate space.  For dinner, in the dining room, our server was friendly, also offered suggestions (including offering a taste of a cask ale that was just tapped), and went above and beyond when things weren't perfect, taking a dish off our bill because of my dislike of it.\n-Good snacks. You should definitely get the Pork Rinds! They come with a tiny bit of chili powder sprinkled on them, with an avocado cream on the side (it's just ok), and half a lime.  Squeeze the lime on them, listen to them crackle, and enjoy! Ahi Poke is good; it lacked a bit of depth of flavor, but the fish quality was great. The Potted Egg sounds weird but is really good.  In the terrine is ricotta cheese, which is heated/melted to a creamy consistency. There is also a large amount of forest mushrooms, adding a nice earthy flavor. And then, in the center is a barely poached/soft boiled egg. All is served with some grilled baguette slices.  Once the egg is broken and everything mixes together, it is an addictive, flavorful, tasty surprise!  \n\nThe reasons to perhaps not rave:\n-There don't seem to be any happy hour type deals.  I understand the place is a more upscale pub, but it's a challenge when in Vegas to pay $13-18 for cocktails (especially when it's not the strongest of drinks) or 7+ for beer. Of course, some of their beer is rare, hard to find, etc. and worthy of said prices.  Maybe some sort of deals in the afternoon, lunch?\n-The mains were disappointing. I went with the Chop Salad and was done after a couple bites.  It is a very small salad (which I was told about in advance, so no problem for me, but fyi) that is overloaded with an odd Buttermilk dressing. The dressing wasn't good really in any way (for me) and the salad was drenched in it.  There also wasn't enough interesting textural variation in the salad.  It was just mushy and weird.  As I mentioned, the server was great and took the salad off the bill, which was entirely unnecessary.  Not everyone's tastes are the same; I don't expect to not pay for something because I don't like it.  But, it's that type of service that'll bring me back. Also, the Pork Belly wasn't what we were hoping for.  It seemed to lack the crispness that we're looking for. Definitely not bad, but I wouldn't order it again (and not at $26).\n-Perhaps just being nitpicky, but there aren't any toilet seat covers in the restroom. They're cheap; get some. And, the paper towels are stacked on the counter, which gets a bit of water on it, and, eventually, on them too.  Maybe get a holder of some sort. \n\nThat being said, I'd totally go back and grab some snacks in the future.

It was very nice and very chic but it was not too fancy. We were instantly greeted by the hostess and immediately seated. Our waiter was super cool- he saw my Groupon on the table and was actually excited about it. He was all, \" Oh great!! Groupon!!\" He took the time to answer our questions about the menu and made great recommendations for my friend and I. He was also very attentive throughout our meal. \n\nI ordered the bacon wrapped dates stuffed with blue cheese to start. OMG. Amazing. They were a mouthful of warm, sweet, salty, bacony and blue cheese goodness!! For $6 you get 3 of them. I was tempted to order a second plate of it but I didn't want to ruin my dinner. For an entree, i got the organic free range chicken. The waiter said it wasn't really necessary to order a side bc it came with mushrooms and farro. It was SO good. The plate had 3 pieces of chicken on top of the farro with mushrooms and sauce. I forgot the name of the dish that my friend ordered but it was sort of like a shepards pie with a twist. There were 3 empanada/dumpling style things - this took place of the crust. And inside them was lamb mixed with a sauce and some veggies. And the 3 pieces lay on top of a potato puree with another sauce. I tried some and it was great and I don't even like lamb!! She said she really liked it. She also got a side of grilled asparagus which was also very good! We were both really really happy with our meals.\n\nOverall, it was a pleasurable dining experience. I highly recommend this place if you want great food!! And I hear if you are a big beer drinker, its even better, there is even a beer specialist on site (sort of like a wine connoisseur but for beer!!!)  And I haven't even mentioned the best part - After the groupon, which was $25 for $50 worth of food, the bill came out to $15!!!

The oysters (3) were on the smaller side, but it was a great one bite starter as the melted foie gras was pretty delicious underneath the oysters. We also had an order of pork rinds and they were great to snack on. \n\nFor our mains, we had the burger and the braised short ribs. The burger was cooked perfectly to my medium rare request and it was very juicy and had good beef flavour. The thin cut shoestring herb fries were good too. I'm from Toronto, and it ranks up there with some of the better burgers I've had here. \n\nMy gf had the short ribs and it was a big Wow for her. It was perfectly cooked and literally melt in your mouth good. It was accompanied by two fantastic onion rings on top of a bed of butternut squash puree.

Our server recommended the pork loin and the diver scallops but something about shortribs seemed so tempting. Korean people like shortribs--kalbi duh... Braised and marinated in a bordelaise sauce, the meat was so soft and tender I could almost get through it knife-less. At $29, and the priciest thing we ordered, the meat portion was quite healthy served alongside a butternut squash mash and a couple onion rings. The mash was unfortunately overladen with butter. And the onion rings didn't stay crispy for long. \n\nBONE MARROW: I wish they cut the bone in half then roasted it. They served 3 pieces of marrow bone; one of which looked like all the marrow had leaked out of the bottom (the main reason why i like mine sliced in half before being cooked). However disappointed I was to scrape the last bits out of that bone, the other 2 were 100% amazing. Marrow, carmelized onion on a piece of crusty bread--win. $14\n\nCANADIAN-FRIENDLY: Not that any place is anti-Canadian, but with as many people I meet on the Strip from the North, I might as well mention Public House serves POUTINE! The upscale Vegas version of course: crispy shoestring fries, cheese curds, and duck confit that will cause some unintentional drooling. All topped with bordelaise \"gravy.\" They really like bordelaise here? As delicious as this was, I found it a tad bit on the salty side and the cheese left a bit of grease at the bottom of the bowl. $9\n\nVARIETY: The menu is reasonably sized and moderately priced offering many options from all the usual animals: cow, chicken, pig. But they also feature quail and other classics from the sea. The person I was with isn't a seafood person; but next time, I'm not holding back! I wanna get into some of the muscles and oysters here.\n\nBEER: There are a million beers on the menu but I had a couple glasses of one of my favorites: Delirium Tremens--a belgium ale that's so much better on tap and almost 2x the alcohol content of regular beer. Next time, I'll venture to try some obscure varieties I've never heard of.\n\nThe food quality in lieu of the beer offerings and dining environment make Public House a shoe-in on my hit list.

You have no idea how excited we were for the poutine. As soon as we saw the waiter walking towards us, our forks were in hand. When the plate landed on the table, it was every man for himself. It was GOOD. Although after eating half of it, it did get a tad salty, but that plate was licked clean. Then the bone marrow. That had to be the star of the night. The bread was perfectly grilled and that bacon marmalade gave each bite of bone marrow and beautiful sweetness. The bone marrow was easy to scoop out of the bones and super delicious. It was very oily though and once you take a bite, if you had chapped lips coming in, you won't have them once you're done. The jamon serrano was good but isn't much to write about.\n\nWe shared the scallops as an entree too and the scallops were cooked very well and the oxtail stew underneath it had a nice red wine flavor that wasn't overpowering.

The menu also includes several barrel aged beer and cask beer. If you're as uninformed as me, take a few moments to chat with the cicerone, Russell Gardner, who will gladly drop some knowledge on you.\n\nMake sure you look at the serving size listed in the menu for each beer.

The menu is full of unique and thoughtful interpretations of classic comfort food.\n\nAppetizers and small bites that our party of four sampled included olives ($6), a selection of three cheeses ($16), and Devils on Horseback ($6), their take on stuffed dates wrapped in bacon. The best app we tried was their Bouchot mussels ($14) which consisted of a dozen or so bivalves in a rich, slightly creamy broth of wit beer and creme fraiche. There was plenty of toast with the dish to sop up every drop. It was so good there was no way we were going to let any go to waste.\n\nFor the main course the French onion soup ($9) was a hit, as was the Lamb pierogies ($26) -- a creative version of \"Shepherd's Pie\" with the dumplings resting atop a potato puree and finished with some lamb jus. The short rib ($29) was a hefty portion of tender beef, but I found it to be too fatty and the sauce bordering on gummy. But, the butternut squash puree and onion rings that came with it were amazing.\n\nAlong with the entrees, we tired the brussel sprouts ($8), which could have cooked a touch longer, and the heirloom beets ($11.50). Even if you hate beets, it's a must! It's the kind of dish that you'll be fighting over. The goat ricotta cheese mouse gave it a sweet taste that was balanced out by the acidity and a touch of bitterness from the other ingredients. \n\nThe service made the experience even better.

Seeing that the Vegas Strip has always been a bit of a craft beer (ahem) desert, on paper this seemed to be exactly what the doctor ordered.\n\nI soon arrived in Las Vegas and high-tailed it to Public House immediately after dropping my bags at The Flamingo. I was greeted by a wonderfully attentive and friendly staff at the bar. I must admit that these young and attractive barkeeps had me wondering if they really knew their chops when it came to beer. Next thing I knew I was discussing the comparative qualities of various sour beer varieties with one of the female servers which (somewhat embarrassingly) really impressed me. So I hereby apologize to all young, attractive and female beer geeks out there. I will never prejudge you again!\n\nSo the draft and bottle selection was impressive indeed. I started with a cask-conditioned Firestone Walker porter which was quite tasty and truly something I might not ever find elsewhere. Then I took a run down the American/Imperial IPA list enjoying several varieties by Uinta (Hop Notch, yum!), Stone and Lagunitas. All fresh and served in proper glassware (always a nice touch).\n\nAlas it was time for a nosh. Impressive menu and definitely on the high-brow end of what one might expect for \"pub grub\". Then again Public House *is* a gastropub after all and they truly live up with their food offerings. I opted for the scallops over oxtail stew. At $29 I was a little apprehensive when I might have been just as happy with a burger and fries at this point. However, let me tell you that this was one of the most fantastic dishes I've ever enjoyed. The aroma of the huge pan-seared scallops over rich red-wine laced oxtail stew demanded my immediate attention (as well as the attention of several others seated at the bar). I'm a meat and potatoes guy so the somewhat small portion had me a bit concerned, but the richness of this flavor-packed entree reinforced the old adage of 'quality over quantity.' Wow, so very happy after this meal.\n\nNeedless to say, I found myself back at Public House several times that week and found myself succumbing to the craving for a second helping of the scallops. Every bit as good the second time! Even better paired with a nice dark porter.\n\nAlready looking forward to my next trip to Vegas and specifically Public House!

The figs were solid and had some nice crispy bacon that wrapped around them - a good starter to split with a few people or to snack on while watching some TV at the bar.  The pork sandwich was divine!  Tender, slightly salty, cheesy, crispy and chewy bread, just everything you want out of a pub sandwich!  And to boot, the restaurant has an extensive beer menu!

The server warned me that the dish does not have added salt, but it is still extremely salty due to the ingredients.  Salty + beer = good, so I went with it.   Although salty, it wasn't offensively salty until I got to the very bottom of the bowl.  But by that time I was stuffed anyway.  It went perfectly with my beer, and let's be honest here, it is all about the beer.\n\nI had a beer blended by the house Cicerone (Russell Gardner), which was a Jolly Pumpkin Oro de Calabaza blended with Maui's Big Swell IPA.  Both beers are two of my favorite beers by themselves.  The Calabaza is a light, tart \"sour\" farmhouse ale.  It's flavor can make you pucker depending on how old it is (the older the more tart).  The Big Swell is a very citrusy, lightly bitter and refreshing IPA.  I knew the two would be great together, and I was right.  What a delight!  Russell hits a home run on his beer blendings.  \n\nThey had many amazing beers, such as Deschutes Black Butte Porter on cask, and Uinta's humongous (12% abv) and delicious imperial stout, Labyrinth on tap (good for dessert).  \n\nIt is worth mentioning that I had a small bite of my friend's tuna salad sandwich, and my other friend's hamburger (the $20 one).  Both were outstanding, although the tuna salad seemed like it could have been canned tuna to me.  \n\nOverall, this place is a gold mine for beer lovers.

Unlike Marilyn's and Earl of Sandwich, this place blew away my rather meager expectations.  Here is what we ordered:\n\nBUTCHER BLOCK (3 items - $24): the potted duck rillettes appear to be heavily doused in delightful black truffle and were an absolutely divine treat, the rabbit loin in porchetta basically melted in the mouth, and the sopresatta had a nice, delicate spicy kick.  Grade: A  \n\nPOUTINE ($12.50): Someone who complained about this dish in another review stated that it was too rich.  Umm.... you ordered poutine!  What did you expect?  There were nice, fresh husks of duck confit throughout the dish and the cheese curd \"gravy\" added another layer of richness.  We added the fried egg to complete the full on massacre of the heart.  Grade: A-  \n\nGRILLED OCTOPUS ($16): Personally, I thought the actual octopus was cooked perfectly; specifically, there was none of that awful chewiness one finds when people overcook the delicate meat.  The accompaniments that came with the dish were admittedly boring though.  Grade: B+\n\nTRUFFLE ARINCINIS ($7): Basically, this is fried risotto balls in a decadent cheese sauce.  I only got hints of the truffle.  Grade: B-\n\nBOSTON BIBB ($13): This was a nice refreshing counter-dish to all of our rich orders.  The classic Bibb is finished with champagne vinaigrette and studded with deliciously flavorful tomatoes.  Grade: B\n\nROASTED BONE MARROW ($15): Standing alone, the bone marrow is nice and delicate, but seemed to be missing something.  Then I tried it with the accompanying bacon marmalade.  Wow.  Again, this kitchen understands their pairings very well.  You don't expect that out of a gastropub.  Or at least I don't.  This was excellent.  Grade: A-\n\nBOUCHOT MUSSELS ($14): The mussels were nice and light, but I wish they were more plump.  The accompanying sauce base was a decadent mix of four of my favorite ingredients in the world: Belgian beer, creme fraiche, bacon, and shallots.  Grade: A\n\nPOTTED FARM EGG ($14): This fondue heavy dish was incredibly rich in the most perfect manner.  I liked the addition of asparagus, but I'm beginning to think we ate it wrong because we are convinced we found two tiny spoons within the dish.  Despite our apparent lack of intellect, this was masterful.  Grade: A\n\nBathroom Grade: A+ for the humor.\n\nService: A because even the incredibly gorgeous women that work here don't hold a candle to the amazing experience we had at Bouchon.  \n\nEven though I don't like to do repeats in a place as large as Vegas, I will be very sad if I don't come here again.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 5, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "Other people have given great full reviews so I'll keep mine kinda short.\n\nOn the plus side:  Food was rich and tasty,and was a good value for the money.

This is just down from the Venetian Showroom. After we sat down, we were informed that it was their opening night. This immediately made me a little wary, as I don't usually frequent restaurants until they've stretched their sea legs a bit. We had briefly glanced at the menu before entering, and my eyes were immediately drawn to the lamb-filled pierogies. As someone of Greek and Polish descent, this was like music to my soul... er... stomach. As I said, it was their opening night and management was palpably nervous, overeager, and ready to please. Our waiter must have come over three or four times to check if everything was OK, and the owner of the restaurant came over for a good-sized chat right after we ordered and again for a moment as we were eating. Strangely, the waiters made laps around the restaurant, quite unnecessarily, it appeared. For example, my husband finished his wine and the waiter picked up his empty wine glass, walked around the restaurant a few times, and then carried it into the kitchen. I watched several full, untouched plates of food go in and out of the kitchen... for inspections, perhaps? I am not well-versed in culinary protocol, but this just looked flat out odd. The busboys wear navy blue polo shirts, and for the price of this restaurant, we felt as if they should be dressed a little more formally. The waiters wear shirts, ties, and jackets, but (and this was REALLY weird) the girls flounce around in white t-shirts, plaid boxer shorts, and knee highs...?!?  It was like Scottish lassies meets well-dressed gentlemen, with a very french d\u00e9cor and style of thatched wine racks everywhere and flat panel TVs. Nothing \"matched.\" \n\nMy husband's hanger steak was excellent, and the pierogies were absolutely out of this world. The mashed potatoes are on the plate, with the pierogies stuffed only with lamb and resting atop the potatoes. Lamb au jus is pooled around the entire plate. YUM!!!  For dessert, we tried the chocolate cake and the sticky toffee pudding, both excellent. The chocolate cake had clusters of Rice Crispies and bacon. I am drooling just thinking about the food. For the food, 10 stars out of five. For service and d\u00e9cor, 2 stars. The music was entirely too loud to have any decent conversation with your company. The waiter accidentally charged us for an entire bottle of Qube, but we only had one glass. Etiquette would usually dictate that the entire glass is removed from the check due to the error, but he simply fixed it and said, \"OK, now you've just been charged for the one glass.\" If he had removed the charge entirely, we would have tipped on the price of the one glass of wine in addition to the food, but because he didn't, we left a 10% tip.

He tasted it and by the look on his face, he was no as impressed as everyone else seemed to be. My drink, on the other hand, was amazing. My fella even admitted that mine was far superior to his.

We got the bone marrow, bacon wrapped figs and the grilled octopus. I have to admit the items we ordered didn't blow me away, but I see potential on the food front. The octopus was a little fishier than I'm used to and I guess I was hoping for a chewier texture. It was just a little different than the octopus I'm used to. The bacon wrapped figs weren't a favorite of mine either. The dressing was just overwhelmingly sweet and I wished that the bacon was just a little crispier to add a less mushy texture to the whole dish. The bone marrow was probably my favorite. It was fatty and fuil of flavor. I was definitely impressed with the restaurant overall and look forward to going back and trying a number of other beers that they offer. I'm also interested by quite a few more options on the food menu that I think hold potential. \n\nThe best part of our dining experience was the service.

And while that statement has so many salacious and insidious connotations here, for our group it meant hitting up one of the places I was most looking forward to for this trip to Sin City. I actually first heard of Public House when I was trying to find anywhere in Vegas that served a good variety of craft/specialty beers, and then subsequently read heavily lauded reviews from Ashley H and Venu N, which only cemented the fact that it would be a must upon arrival.\n\nIt's tucked way back in the recesses of The Venetian, and may take a bit of exploring to find, especially since it's one of the more \"normal\" looking restaurants you'll spot in a Vegas casino, from the outside. Inside though, the place definitely has a unique charm. As mentioned by Venu, the bathroom humor here is some of the best I've ever seen. Unfortunately for me my digital camera memory card died about a week after my Vegas trip ended, completely wiping all the photos I had taken (and idiotically not yet transferred to my laptop), so you'll only be privy (no pun intended) to the one gem I recall reading, just above the men's urinal: \"Stand a little closer, it's smaller than you think.\"\n\nVidal, Julie, Zack, and I all set down and started drinking as soon as we had gone through the 100 or so beers on the very nifty iPad like tablet they use here, while we waited on Brian to arrive and join us. Unfortunately I had lured everyone here with the promise of beautiful women, and while there were a few cute hostesses, our waiter turned out to more closely resemble Humpty Dumpty (which, ironically, was a fascination of former restaurateur David Burke, who used to occupy this space), and their cicerone (akin to a sommelier, for beer) someone who had retired from his former life as a circus ring master. Both were quite nice, indeed, but my mates hopes were far from fulfilled. Perhaps the most embarrassing moment of the night came when, on multiple occasions, their cicerone poured our beers much like someone on their first shift at an average sports bar would, causing head to flow over all down the glass and on the table. This is something I expect from Uncle Buck, not someone with a professional certification in beer service. As for the list itself, it's pretty good, with about 100 bottles to choose from, all pretty fairly priced (I went with the Trappistes \"Rochefort 10\" at $16 and the Firestone Walker \"Wookey Jack\" Black Rye IPA at $25 for a 22oz) and nicely arranged by style. I was hoping to see a few more really rare finds, similar to the elite class of beer bars, but that was mostly missing here. There is high quality stuff to be sure, but most of it can be found at any of the mid-tier beer bars around the country. Compared to the virtual (and literal) desert that is the Vegas beer bar scene though, this is at the mountain top by a mile.\n\nThe food turned out to be quite good as well, although I think we would have been wiser to follow some of the previous diners' examples and stick with multiple shared medium plates rather than the entr\u00e9e dishes. My beer braised short rib and IPA battered onion rings were great, and the sweet pea puree was certainly novel, if not distracting, but I don't think the pork loin, pub burger, or pappardelle quite pleased my friends as much, and after a few bites of each I concurred that while they were solid, they weren't up to the same level. The Welsh rarebit was a massive disappointment that I do not recommend, and the poutine was great (to me), although my friends found it extremely salty, and technically I think it's more like disco fries with duck confit on top, rather than actual poutine.

Located at The Venetian Hotel and Casino right across from the Blue Man Group theater, the wife and I decided to try this  based off from all the good Yelp reviews and we were not disappointed. I researched the menu before arriving so I knew what I wanted, but unfortunatly the menu I was handed only somewhat resembled the on-line version and many of my choices were missing. This was rather aggravating but all was forgiven after the meal as what I did have was excellent.  All the plates are designed for sharing which is nice as it allows you to try a little of everything. One of my favorite things was being able to design my own meat and cheese platters.  For the cheese choice we went with Welsh Cheddar, seriously sharp and seriously good and served with a Fresh sweet Tomato jam. For the meat choices we went with a thin sliced and delicious Serrano Ham with whole grain mustard and Potted Duck Rillettes ,which was basically a duck confit spread served in what looked like a candle jar. This was rich and creamy and paired well with the cheese, tomato jam mustard and Ham. All the items were served with some nice grilled crunchy French Bread.  Our next course was Duck Poutine ( because I can't get enough of duck or Fries with Cheese Curds and Gravy)  This would have been better had the fries been homemade as is traditional poutine but was still very good. The gravy was dark and rich and made with dark porter ale beer. The whole dish was greasy goodness.  Next up we split a short rib entree, complete with neon green sweet pea mashed potatoes, more stout gravy and a couple onion rings for garnish. The short rib was fall apart tender and extremely meaty and rich. This was far better then any other steak I had while  in Vegas ( sorry Mr. Gordon Ramsey). Lastly was dessert, which we didn't really need but were glad we got.  I can't actually remember the name but it was a deliciously moist chocolate layer cake laced with chocolate mousse and topped with Bacon Rice Krispie Square Pieces ( yes you read that correctly Bacon Rice Krispies). This was an over the top dessert. Also don't forget to check out the bathrooms while your here- they are complete with witty sayings on the walls and above the sinks.

The octopus came out just right;  the texture was soft to bite into.  I was worried it'd be rubbery but that wasn't the case at all.  The octopus by itself is boring but if you combine it w/ the veggies, sauce, and the peppers it's almost like eating a fresh salad.

The marrow acts as the \"butter\" for the bread slices while the carmelized onions gives it that much needed kick.

Initial taste was light and fruity and the follow up was of a dark beer. No surprise considering it was a darker beer. I took a sip Anthony M took a sip and we looked at each other.

I've only heard of poutines through EPIC MEAL TIME!! so what i was expecting was already warped by internet bacon. What came out was a classier version and not as heavy or as...umm...drenched as what i was expecting.

In any case, this place describes itself as a gastropub.\n\n***The Menu***\nLots and lots of beer - more than 200 varieties. I counted 24 taps and 3 casks. Food offerings are more adventurous than those found at a typical bar - especially the appetizers. Thus, there is poutine, foie gras, bone marrow and octopus.\n\n***The Atmosphere***\nI sat at the bar, so my comments are restricted to that area. At 7 pm on a Saturday, it was moderately full, and got busier as the evening progressed. However, it never felt crowded, and even the loud rock music wasn't bothersome. It's a good place you can sit around, watch one of the television sports games, and talk to other patrons.\n\n***The Food***\nI decided on two appetizers, figuring that would make a light meal: poutine; bouchot mussels with beer, shallots, bacon and cr\u00e8me fraiche. Alcohol consisted of one bottle of Sam Smith's Pale Ale. The mussels were slightly gritty, and not especially plump. However, the rich sauce hid some of that, and there was plenty of toasted bread to sop everything up. Not good for a restaurant, but not bad for a bar. Now, about the poutine: for the uninitiated, poutine is a French Canadian dish made with french fries, cheese curds and gravy; other stuff is sometimes added. Public House's poutine consisted of: a very large bowl of thin, crisp french fries; a small amount of gravy; two modest pieces of cheese curd; a generous amount of duck; a fried egg (optional). This was the first time I had ever tried the stuff, so take my comments with a grain of salt*. However, I've got to believe there are better versions out there. This version was seriously lacking in cheese and gravy, yet still managed to be very salty.\n\n(*As a native of Bawlmer, Merlin, I know that french fries are meant to be served with gravy only; cheese curds are for furriners.)\n\n***Summary***\nI liked Public House's atmosphere, and would consider returning for a beer or two. However, my first experience makes me wary of ordering food again. The problem may lie in expectations. Describing itself as a gastropub, I expected restaurant quality food; I got bar quality food.

She was very friendly, attentive, and made me feel special. I started out with some appetizers. I had the burrata cheese and the devils on horseback. The burrata cheese was beautifully crafted. It consisted of burrata cheese (an Italian cheese; mozzarella and creme), tomatillo sauce, chicharones, and grilled nopales. Yes, you read right, grilled cactus. \n\nThe dish was great to start out with. I grabbed a pork rind and dove right into the cheese and mixed it with the sauce and cactus. It was different, and different is GOOD, let me tell you. Complex flavors of creamy cheese, cactus and the sauce was amazing! Have it with a Stella and you'll see for yourself. Then I moved on to the devils. Dates stuffed with Roquefort blue cheese, wrapped in applewood smoked bacon. The whole salty, sweet thing going on. Obviously, they are light years ahead of the competiton ;)\n\nAfter I finished my apps, I was ready to order my steak. I heard this place cooks up one hefty steak, so I decided to see if the legend was true.. Lorelei told me that there was a special going on. A veal chop with asparagus, king crab legs, and bearnaise on the side. I'm allergic to shellfish and I asked if she could replace the crab with someone else. She smiled, and took care of it right away. While waiting on my entree, I looked around and noticed how happy the table next to me was with their meal so I knew I was in for a treat. \n\nOut comes my entree. She told me the chef put a potato puree under the chop because of my allergy to the crab and even a lil bit more asparagus, this made me happy! I poured my bearnaise on my chop and got to diggin' in. I couldn't even finish my meal because it was so good. It's very rare to find a place that cooks up a meal so good that it has that effect. The Veal itself was tender, juicy, full of flavor. The asparagus' taste was fresh, and the bearnaise really kicked it up a notch! This was a great dining experience to bring in the new year.

Everything about the place just seemed subdued, making it an ideal atmosphere to take your lady for an intimate dinner before the rowdiness that are Vegas clubs. \n\nOnce you get seated you get to take a look at the menus. Public House is noted for it's beer and wine selection. While they do have a wine list, they will bring the staff sommelier by to answer any questions you might have about the wine selection. If beer is what you have a taste for they do have a pretty decent selection for you to peruse. The biggest downside to the beer menu is that it is on an iPad. This is fine if your party is 2 people, not so fun when you have 8. \n\nThe menu is typical of an American upscale restaurant. Yes, it's expensive. You're at the Venetian, on the strip, in Vegas.

For me the skin wasn't all that crispy and lacked flavor. For my buddy sitting across the table from me, it was just too dry. Many in our party had the burger. I think one finished it. All complained that it was overly greasy. I know I know it's a burger, but you expect more out of a place this upscale. \n\nThe steaks and shellfish platters were well done. My friends gave them rave reviews and left the rest of us jealous. \n\nThe service was ok. Nothing to complain about, but nothing memorable. \n\nOverall, I think this is a nice place to eat.

Their slogan - \"United We Stand, Pint in Hand\" - lured me in to check out their craft beer selection. They did not have an overwhelming selection but enough to satisfy this beer geek. But before making a final decision on the Public House, I did a little research on my smartphone and found out that the Public House was created and owned by the same people who started Holsteins, which is a top notch burger joint further down the strip in the Cosmopolitan. After that point, I was confident I could not go wrong with the Public House. \n\nAppetizer: The poutine was highly recommended from a super helpful and pleasant waitress.  She said this was not only one of her favorite appetizers but one of the most ordered appetizers on the menu.  After reading the description on the menu, I was thinking how could we go wrong with the poutine? French fries covered with duck, cheese and coated with a stout gravy. Yeah it tastes as good as it sounds. My wife and I finished every single french fry, piece of duck, cheese curd, and if I had thrown my manners out of the door I would have licked every drop of the stout gravy. \n\nBeers: My first beer was the Cask Dirty Dog IPA which was dry hopped with Amarillo. For those who have not had a cask beer before, it is pretty much beer without most or all of the carbonation. It really relies on the flavors of the hops and malts. Since I'm a big fan of Amarillo hops because of their distinct citrus and orange flavors, I knew I would not be disappointed with this beer. Sure enough, without the carbonation this beer quickly disappeared. Looking for a beer with a bigger and bolder bite, the next beer I decided to try was the Lake Mead Monster Amber Ale. Advertised as imperial amber ale, this beer boasted an abv of 8.9% and was packed full of spicy bitterness. I would definitely recommend this beer to those who enjoy full bodied beers. \n\nEntrees: I had the Pub Burger and my wife had the Lobster Roll. The Pub Burger was a thick and juicy ground beef patty, with gruyere cheese, guinness mayo, fire roasted tomato, and bacon marmalade layered in between a soft and freshly baked bun. One bite and I was hooked. This was an amazing burger! Every ingredient came together nicely to produce this tasty burger. My wife's lobster roll was equally as amazing. Big chunks of perfectly cooked Maine lobster was mixed in the perfect amount of mayo to create one of the best lobster rolls she had ever tasted. The quality of the lobster was over the top. Apparently they fly in fresh Maine lobster daily and it shows in the quality of the lobster. \n\nThe Public House is an easy four stars. The service, the food and the craft beer are excellent!

Three course meals for $29.  I loved this venue.    I went with two girlfriends.   Be sure to ask for a booth rather than a table.   I started with the Chop salad (Avacado, bacon, hearts of palm, tomato, blue cheese and red wine vinaigrette)   Main course was the roast filet of King Salmon northwest spice rubbed and roasted with a touch of huckleberries.    My friends had Colorado Lamb chops and double cut pork chops.   I finished with  carmel chocolate Creme Brulee with passion fruit.   The best presentation of the evening though was the hand rolled chocolate cigar dipped in hazelnut croquant frangelico anglasie.   It had an \"ash tray and matches\" on the plate.  Sounds nuts,  I know, but it was really great.  \n\nOur waiter, Angel, was there just enough and carried on the right amount of conversation.  Yves Leger, the wine steward, knows his wine!   He is from France!   I think we embarrassed him when we asked him to say something romantic in French.   He did speak French BUT it was probably his address.  It sounded wonderful whatever he said.  \n\nThis is a very nice \"special date\" spot.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 4, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "The Grill is the restaurant attached to the TPC stadium golf course and is run by the Fairmont Princess Hotel.  It was formerly a steak house, but it's theme was changed to chop and fish house to avoid direct competition with the other property restaurant, \"Bourbon Steak\", a Michael Mina signature faux chic-dive that can barely get food out of the kitchen.  \n\nThe Princess closed the other property restaurants, Marquesa (5 Stars) and La Hacienda (5 stars) to drive business to Bourbon Steak. The Grill easily and seemingly without effort beats the Bourbon Steak restaurant hands down in every category.\n\nDuring the day, for lunch, the views of the golf course (#18) are restful and pleasing.  The golfers add a pleasant touch to the view. At night, the view is inky blackness, which is ok by me.\n\nI never understand how this place survives.  In spite of the Princess Hotel total lack of interest in the success of this restaurant, The Grill continues to be a great place to get an if somewhat expensive, excellent dinner.  \n\nIn fairness, in terms of cost, it's no worse than Mastros, Ocean or any other high end restaurant, and certainly less expensive than Bourbon Steak, but the setting is much more intimate, the service much better, and the food every bit as good, if not better than those other \"must do\" places.\n\nThe staff is always knowledgeable, friendly and attentive.  I've been many times and have never been disappointed.  The service is, in a word, professional.\n\nOur recent dinner of Vermouth Mussels, Appetizer Ravioli, Fillet Mignon, pan seared mushrooms and risotto was up to their usual standards.  The ravioli in particular was incredible, sparking a small battle for a access to the delicious pasta.\n\nAlthough we didn't have fish, the fish menu is pretty extensive and always done well.  The table next to us ordered the lamb and I could overhear them raving about how good it was.   I had the lamb last time and was pleased. We were similarly happy with our choices on this occasion. \n\nThere is an extensive wine list and a good selection of by-the-glass choices. \n\nBottom line:  If you are looking for white linen tablecloth experience, The Grill is the place to go.  Good food, professional service, you will be able hear your dinner companions and you will be well taken care of.\n\nUpdate:  The Grill is only open for breakfast and lunch during the summer (June - August) months.

I ordered the chicken soup as an appetizer - it was okay, although the broth tasted like beef broth.  My husband ordered the parmesan salad, which he liked.  I ordered the filet for dinner - it was incredibly salty and the portion was very small for the money we paid.  I'd much rather eat at the White Chocolate Grill - their filet is 10000000 times better.  My husband ordered the halibut (suggestion from waiter) and it was overcooked.  He told him it was overcooked. He offered to get a new one, but my husband said it was so bad he didn't want another one.  Here's the kicker... he only had 2 bites (yes, 2 bites) and they charged us for his meal!  When I asked the waiter if he'd made a mistake, he looked at me like I made the mistake.  He did remove it after I further explained that he didn't eat it (that was obvious), but without apology.

Lets start with the appetizer Duck Confit Tacos.....OH MY GOD these were amazing and if my meal was gonna start out like this my expectations just got a lot higher cause these are worth getting. There was 4 small tacos great to share with someone or if you are like me and can take down some food a good starter. Now for the entree Deep friend Lasagna which once again blew me away and later i found out it was a recipe from one of the chefs grandmother which instantly means its gonna be good so being that i am a big eater I took that down without a problem and almost skipped dessert which would have been a poor decision on my part. I asked my server what he suggest as i always do and he suggested the buttered mac 12 creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e as it was touched up with a mac 12 year scotch and had raisins soaked in burbon and with each bite i became more and more happy which my decision.
