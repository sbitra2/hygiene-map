The interior is \"lodge\"y with using pieces of wood trunks to decorate and some Jamison barrels scattered around.  This seems like a nice place for me to bring my laptop and work on the weekends.\n\nI ordered a ice latte to go (minus 1 star for charing a dollar for vanilla syrup!), and it's really smooth.  I don't get that burnt taste I usually get at Starbucks.  I'm really glad I have a place to grab caffeine on my way to work.\n\nThere's also a full bar in case I wanted an extra kick with my coffee.

I walked up to the register unsure of what I wanted, so I asked for suggestions. I love when and employee can suggest something that actually fits my needs.

(sad I know)\n\nI have never tried a Panini so I was kind of excited that it was actually something that I would eat. I ordered the aged cheddar Panini with no mustard. It took approximately 10 minutes served with a pickle and some pepper chips. It was so freaking good I wanted another but, was full by the time I finished half. \n\nI also ordered a vanilla iced latte with lite ice. I have to say that this as well was pretty good. I don't know if I was charged extra for the syrup or not. Hence I didn't get a detailed receipt. \n\nOverall the d\u00e9cor is pretty modern, with like a mountain American type theme.

I had the bacon, egg, & cheese sandwich with a white mocha (total 19 and change). The drinks were nothing spectacular -probably middle of the road average. The coffee prices are comparable to Starbucks (4.25 for a 16 oz white mocha). I was told the breakfast sandwich I ordered was new... it was okay - fast food-esque served on a plate.

There noticeably were only a couple of patrons.\n\n\"You're not allowed to be here,\" the greeter barked at us sternly.\n\n\"Oh, we're just here for coffee,\" my friend replied as she stopped dead in her tracks.\n\n\"Under 21 only,\" deadpanned the greeter.\n\nWe were bewildered as we pulled out our IDs for her inspection. The greeter should have simply asked for our IDs rather than assume we were all under 21. Besides, I know Asians look young, but really? I'm 34, and the last educated guess at my age was 27. Seriously speaking, I appreciate the compliment, but the way it was given was certainly not orthodox.\n\nThe four of us were then seated at living room style couches and sofas. As we did not receive menus, we had to flag down the hostess again for that reason. I ordered a tangerine smoothie while my friends ordered alcoholic mixed beverages. \n\nAnother oddity occurred when we went up to the counter to order pastries after ordering our drinks with the server. The hostess at the counter took my friends order of two pastries and asked if they could be placed in the same bag since they were out of bags. My friend agreed.\n\nBut then I placed my order, saying that she could place it in a napkin if need be. She nodded her head. I received my order in a bag identical to the ones they were allegedly out of, along with a napkin and utensils all wrapped in plastic. Strange.\n\nSo we received our drinks. My friends' alcoholic beverages were average and nothing special, while my smoothie was not a smoothie. It was shaved italian ice colored orange and loaded with a large quantity of sugar. The aftertaste reeked (not even tasted, reeked) of sweetness from the sugar. If I wanted a Slurpee, I would have chosen to instruct the server to obtain my beverage from the 7-11 next door. \n\nAt one point, we found that we could not find our server once again. Eventually, my friend located her... sitting in a customer's chair in front of a slot machine, smoking a cigarette. Ok, I understand a smoke break, but in front of the customers? \n\nOn the way out, I noticed a machine that produced the different colored so-called \"smoothies.\" It was similar to those used to make frozen ice desserts. I shook my head. We waved and yelled out our good nights but, not surprisingly, we were not acknowledged at all.\n\nI would be open to trying this place again if the management responds actively to this review. Perhaps the off-peak staff is simply staff-in-training. \n\nUntil then, I can get better smoothies at McDonald's for a fraction of the cost.\n\nTwo stars minus one star for the service = one star.", "review_stars": 1, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I am utterly confused by this place.

Most of the time we would've taken our money else where but hey, we drove all the way here, so we might as well just get our drinks and because the place itself might be worth it.  \n\nThe place:  There is a nice outdoor area that you can sit and a few tables and then a couch area with a TV and fire place.  However this place seemed confused of it's own identity.  Even though the title said coffee house and tavern, I would've assume that majority it will be a coffee house before anything.  From the layout and decor I definitely did not get a tavern but more of a lounge. The place looked clean and organized but there is the cigarette scent lingering so it's no longer a place you would want to relax and hangout.  There's also a few gambling machines.\n\nThe experience ---  I walked in with my friends thinking to grab a quick cup of coffee (since it said Coffee House) to just wind down the day. However, we walked into a pretty empty place with a few other patrons.  A staffer finally saw us but before I was even able to say anything the girl on staff straight up said we \"are not allowed in here\" with what I will assume her authorizing tone.  I was extremely taken aback by how I was greeted.  The waitress just kept on telling me how this place is 21 OVER ONLY.  So apparently she thought we were all underage.  Okay, fine that you think we look young, thank you. However, this is NOT how you are to approach a patron even if they ARE underage. She also added in a lot of hand jesters and body movement to be along with what she is rambling about.  Sorry, but I've got the indication she was also racial profiling us as if we did not understand the English language.  I have to wait until she was done with her rambling because I can't even cut in just to tell her that we are all over 21.  So after we clarified that we are of legal age she didn't even asked to see our ID.  What if I actually lied? Then she just allowed minors to gamble and order alcohol.\n\nThe food/drink experience --- Drinks are the fun part.  After we bypass the initial checkpoint we sat by the couch area but still confused if this is an \"order your food and sit down\" or table service, another thing I didn't get to ask when we were busy saying we are over 21.  The waitress came with the menu but  seemed a bit too zealous where I felt rushed to decide on my drink.  I do not know if she felt bad on how she was earlier or she want us in and out of that place but definitely did not help the mindset on this place.   After the waitress took our drink orders, two of us got up to check out what pastries they have.  (This part may just be a bit odd) After I ordered they told me that they only have 1 paper bag left to hold my pastries and asked if she can put both in one. It's fine with me since it's one order. However, my friend who was behind me order a pastry separately and actually got a paper bag when it supposedly have ran out a minute ago, wait, did she just lied to me???  She also moved very slow, I seriously have never seen someone taking so long to get a cookie and a muffin. I could've chopped down a tree and processed it to paper bags within that time. \n\n(This part is a peeve) I don't think I have ever been at a place that when we order drinks, let alone alcoholic drinks, they do not place a napkin acting as a coaster and then the drink. Isn't this basic 101 knowledge?  So I had to go and ask for napkins only to find our waitress, sitting down and smoking on the clock.  Is that even allowed?  If it is allowed in the state of NV then I apologize and at least it solved the smokey scent issue here.  Sometimes I forget that places aside from casinos also allowed smoking inside.\n\nAnyway, I can only speak for 2 of this drinks since I didn't try the others.\n\nChai Martini with Soymilk - This drink is not on the menu, it was a recommendation. Apparently the chai martini now requires no mixing. Top layer is chai tea/alcohol and bottom layer is the soy milk.  you can distinctively see the separation.  It would be nice that I can mix it up myself but oh wait, nothing to stir with.  The chai taste is not bad but I definitely will not say it's the best chai martini I've ever had.  This one is good if you do not like alcohol but want to drink out of martini glass.\n\nTangerine smoothie - This should apologize to all smoothies.  It felt really refreshing when you are first drinking it but the aftertaste is the sugary burn similar to the ones you get when you drink a slurpy or icee.\n \nRedeemable point (+1 star): The muffin and cookie I ordered was not that bad and one of my friend thought her drink was okay.  \n\nOverall, I will never set foot in this place again since they don't seem to care about returning customers.

I used to visit regularly but much of it was because of the original staff who made it a fun visit and I do enjoy the coffee and hot tea. Besides the issue with the staff and the person I just mentioned, the prices have increased quite a bit and it cost me nearly $7 for a bagel with cream cheese and a tea with some soy and vanilla. If I wanted to pay Starbucks prices, I would just go to Starbucks! In fact and although I don't really care for Starbucks pastries, I think Starbucks has better pastries/cakes! I love the casual but modern \"woodsy\" ambiance which is unique in this city, but I cannot see really going here much anymore even though it is in my direct run between home and work. But so is McDonald's and I can get a breakfast sandwich and coffee for just around $5. Sometimes I wish things could go back to the way they were when they first opened aside from everyone taking a long time to prepare things and putting the tea bags in ashtrays - yes I did say ashtray's because that's what someone did because they had nothing to display them in! Luckily someone realized how disgusting that was! And they were not even brand new ashtrays because there were burn marks in some of them. There is a breakfast sandwich which I think one of the girls may have made up with possibly a sourdough bread, egg, cheese, spinach, tomato and a chipotle-mayo dressing perhaps? This was really good but I'm not sure they can still make it and if it is/was on the menu. I haven't been there in a few weeks now but it would have been breaking the bank if I was going everyday like I was going in the beginning when they were running a lot of morning specials which helped keep my spending down and felt I could treat myself. My hope is that management does read these and that they make some changes. If they do and I can tell they are positive changes, I may return more frequently.

A lot of vodka. But hardly any Yelp reviews mentioned the food - what's with that people?!

Most pubs'll do a beef burger, a veggie burger and occasionally a rogue chicken burger. I think they had about 4 different types of beef burgers, a lamb burger, veggie burger and 'The Cougar' - the chicken burger which I opted for.\n\nNow, the YEY comes in with The Cougar (I had it Cajun style, added jalape\u00f1os). It was literally a whole, huge chicken breast in delicious cajun spices. It was so juicy, and tender, and spicy, and really all I could ask for in a chicken-breast burger. The jalape\u00f1os in particular deserve a special shout out as they were SPICY. I know right? Most places I got I can't even taste the jalape\u00f1os which makes me think they're old. These certainly had a kick.\n\nIt came presented on a wooden tray (wooden trays with food are so hot right now. Seriously, everywhere is doing it). A nice freshly baked sesame bun, not store-bought methinks. A wee pot of coleslaw and a larger pot of fries.\n\nI usually don't eat my chips as bread and meat does me fine, add in potatoes and I'm in a food coma. I tried one or two but was glad I don't normally eat the chips as they were very pale, and hardly been cooked at all. They werent BAD, or still actually frozen, but they were luke-warm and jst a bit 'meh'.\n\nSteven B tells me his beef burger was good. He went for the plain ol' standard beef burger. The lettuce and tomato was there, check. Nice bun. Check. But from what I could see his beef burger was about half the size of my chicken breast burger. It was really quite thin. It says on the menu quarter-pounders and that they're home-made but side-by-side it just looked a bit paltry. He was the one eating it, not me, and he didnt complain.\n\nHowever, knowing that when I go for burgers with other folk and I always get chicken burgers, they often get beef. And I know they'd be disappointed with the size of that burger. And therein, good people of yelp, lies the problem and the 50/50 scenario. AWESOME chicken burger, teeny-tiny beef burger. But as I said, he ate it all and enjoyed it. I just know I would have had food envy of the one that I got *smug look*\n\nI will be back to try the huge range of vodka.

I'm sure that doesn't help the flavour.\n\nThey measured mine (a red) out first, and then .. oh then, the ultimate, deadly faux pas of winery: they poured my friend's white into the exact same measuring cup used to measure the red, without washing it first.

This was going to be a special night.\n\nAfter that I asked for a jug of water, the waiter confirmed by asking if we'd like a jug -yes we would please- and brought us two glasses instead.\n\nThree strikes and you're out.

It was tasty and moist, but not quite as good as my chicken burger. Both came in a seeded bun that was fresh and toasted on the inside, just how I like them. We got them with a portion of handcut chips and a portion of sweet potato chips which has a yummy cajun seasoning on them, very scrummy.
