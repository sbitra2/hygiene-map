An unassuming storefront and simple decor will make you think the food is the sole (Seoul?) focus, which is fine with me. In all my years of eating there, I've only scratched the surface of the menu, because I just can't get past their Rock Cooker Bibimbop. A superheated stone bowl sizzling with rice, layered with sprouts, spinach greens, shredded carrots, and tofu, topped with a sunny-side up egg, this dish is one of the simplest, most satisfying meals to be had, and is a great demonstration of an evolving dining experience, as temperature, texture, sights and sounds change as you dig in. The egg yolk transforms from runny creaminess to rich, almost hard-boiled texture as it sizzles against the rock bowl, the crisped fried egg white in tow. The veggies, starting out cold, change from fresh and snappy to yielding and caramelized in minutes. Excavating  through the rice, the pillowy starchiness gives way to a crisp shell that's a great contrast. All through this, enjoy an assortment of the usual suspects- miso soup, kimchi, pickled radish and cucumber, and candied sweet potatoes- to complete the dining experience. And if that doesn't do it  for you, there's always that stick of Juicy Fruit gum that comes with every purchase. Service was prompt and cordial as always, and the food was amazing.

Not what I'm used to, but still acceptable. My major gripe was with the lack of anything other than tofu in my soup. \n\nThe banchan was below average as well. We had three different side dishes: the fried sweet potato, kimchi, and some sort of pickled radish.

While the news on Isthmus only stated that this restaurant opens everyday from 11am-11PM, I didn't expect that that they would be on break during 3.30 till 5.30 PM (my Korean friend did tell me about this, as that is how Korean restaurant usually operates in Korea). My other Korean friends have been posting on facebook about the opening of this new restaurant since a couple of weeks ago. For me, it is always a good sign if the native of the food is excited about the restaurant of which they can be the standard of judgement. \n\nThat night we were so lucky that we got the last seat. It was around 7 PM and the restaurant was full. I guess it was partly due to the number of few seats the restaurant has and also due to the excitement of Madisionian for the new place. Some people after us left as there was not any spot available.\n\nAbout the service, it was pretty quick (as I was told earlier by a friend who came the day before during dinner time that it took her and her boyfriend about 30 minutes to finally devour their toppoki and the cold noodle, but she said it was worth waiting). The waiter was nice and was responsive when I asked her about the menu. My Korean friend of course was speaking about the menu and the order in their native language, which I really love and I enjoyed their conversation so much. So, my bias about the service is already detected.   \n\nAbout the food, we ordered Toppoki, beef Bulgogi and the American-Korean fusion noodle (too bad it's with spam, so I didn't get to taste it, but my Korean friend said it tastes like it's served in Korea and they served it in the pot-  Korean doesn't serve the noodle in the bowl, but it should be in the pot - I learned it from the dramas and my Korean friend confirmed it.). As for the Toppoki, it came in a smaller portion (I'm comparing with the portion served in another Korean restaurant in town) however, it is much tastier and the appearance is more similar with the one that I usually see on Korean dramas I watched (It comes with egg too and that's how it is usually served in Korea). I love their toppoki as it serves my taste bud just right. It may be way too spicy for those who do not like spicy food. \n\nThe bulgogi which has a variety of meat from beef, chicken, pork and seafood (plus 2 bucks for seafood) is okay. Yeah, too bad I can't give a very good review for this. I may have been too excited for the toppoki, so the taste of the bulgogi doesn't really leave some strong taste. By the way, bulgogi in Korea is always beef, so if you want to taste the \"real\" bulgogi, just order the beef one, not other meat. \n\nThe side dishes they provided were cucumber pickles (I'm not a big fan of pickles, but this one is super fresh and good, ask the waitress to give you one, if they don't give you any), the lettuce and green onion which is a great side dish and kimchi which is another average.\n\nMy overall experience eating here is good and I'll be back. \nI asked my Korean friend about the food and she said: \"The menu is very limited but the ones that we ordered, I can say, are authentic\".

The stone bowl dish (unfortunately the name escapes me) had a good melding of flavors that gave the dish a good texture, but unfortunately, it was a bland tasting dish, as they allow you to have complete control of the spice of the dish by giving you the sauce.

I don't believe that all restaurants that are specialty restaurants have to accommodate every single food fad or taste that people want. There are restaurants that I don't eat at in town because I know they are not things I can or would eat.

Yes, we are in America but Sol's portions are very sufficient for a satisfying meal without feeling stuffed. \n\nPrices: Very reasonable for downtown Madison unless you want to go to Korea and get bibimbap for $3.00.\n\nDecor and Music: Korean restaurants in Korea are by nature a little cheesy and bland. And music as well. While I agree with other reviewers that these two things are maybe not what our standards of decor and music would be in a restaurant of this type they are very Korean. Authentically Korean. The space on the walls and the color of the paint bugs me every time I go but I laugh because I know it to be typically Korean and it reminds me of being in Korea as much as the food does. \n\nI'm not a drinker so can't comment on bar selections but my friend had a drink and said it was very weak. \n\nI give Sol's 5 stars for satisfying my craving for authentic Korean food and making me feel like I'm back in Korea every time I visit. I recommended Sol's for a full Korean dining experience.  Korean food is an acquired taste and unlike any other ethnic cuisine. Try to lose the expectations and just enjoy the experience of something different.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "As you read reviews, I hope you take into consideration Sol's only opened around September of 2013. With that, many of the earlier reviews were through a transitional phase that every restaurant goes through! The Sol family is always there running the restaurant and they have been working really hard to get their restaurant at a solid place. Many of the negative reviews on here rip on the decor/atmosphere. No lie-not the coolest or most innovative looking place, but Caribou looks like shit and has a fantastic burger so why don't we put those comments on the back burner and talk about the food, yeah? \n\nI eat here just about every week and just want to point out some basic highlights that took me a bit to find and you might really enjoy them if you're a novice in the world of Korean food like me. \n\nBibimbap with bulgogi is a solid dinner choice with rice, some hot sauce an egg and pickles with spinach (getting it on a hot stone will keep that dish SCALDING hot the whole time). I love the spinach, but it comes in the bibimbap and runs $6 on the menu so I'd just go for the bibimbap. \nJapchae will be clear noodles with the bulgogi and some onions and peppers-the portion will be enough for one person's dinner. \nGimbap is always a hit! and also just the bulgogi dish with rice is simple and delicious. Many of my friends love the spicy squid too. I am not the biggest fan of the Soondobu because it's pretty tame, but it will cure a hangover if you are in need. \nTonkatsu will be one i'd be steer away from unless you don't want to do any of the pickles, or kimchi and want a super basic dish. It is tasty but this is one of the dishes you might be pissed about eating in a restaurant because it wouldnt be hard to make something similar at home (deep fried breaded pork with rice and a piece of shrimp)\nGalBiJJim is a smart choice to split between two or three  for $32 it is a TON of food,i i'm talking a pile of short ribs in a sizzling hot pot with a big bowl of rice on the side. \n\nHope this helps you get acquainted with Sol's menu!

The sauce, the texture of the dish as a whole, the vegetables that came with it-- nothing about it resembled Korean spicy squid except the \"squid\" part.\n\nThe seafood pancake had an American flare to it. It was very thick and dense and resembled an American buttermilk pancake in appearance and texture (except this one had seafood in it of course).

Jun's charges the same as any of these restaurants but only gives you about 1/3 of the portion. And the marinade they use leaves something to be desired.\n\nThey do give you side dishes before your food comes out as is customary in Korean restaurants, but the side dishes are a bit curious as well.

I ordered the Kalbi and thought it was one of the best I have ever had.  \n\nYou really should never get a Chicken dish from a Korean restaurant. Korean cuisine just does not specialize in Chicken.  Korean marinated chicken is practically the California Roll of Korean food. It's not a true authentic style dish.  The only times you should ever get chicken at a Korean restaurant is if it is a Chinese-Korean restaurant and they got Tang So Yuk(spelling?). \n\nI like how JUN's features this \"oldschool\" style of K-food, that you don't find very often anymore.  To me, it gives off more of an authentic feel. What most of Vegas locals are accustomed to is the Hawaiian-Korean style food. Sure, that's good too but I guess it's actually not real.\n\nI ordered to-go for all my annoying Norwegian friends, and I couldn't believe how much food they gave us. When the lady handed me the bag, it literally felt like 40 pounds of food. I had a lot of trouble carrying it to my car.\n\n What I really like is that they have the low calorie/healthy versions of the Korean dishes. These recipes have minimal sugar and no oil in the marinades. They also have brown rice as well. \n\nThere was absolutely nothing wrong with the customer service here like many of the Yelpers are claiming. I've been to some nightmarish Korean restaurants in my life, and this was not one of them. East-Asian people prefer to stay quiet if their English isn't perfect, and a lot of White and Black-Americans interpret that as \"rude\". People from Mainland China(not Taiwan) and Philippines may also leave comments about \"bad service\" due to the whole inter-asian rivalry.  I just don't see a problem with this place's service.\n\n5-Stars", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 8, "cool": 5}}, {"text": "The Bulgogi, Kalbi ribs, and BBQ chicken were all great.

Probably doesn't matter anyway. She has lived here for the past 10 years and driving 15 miles away is considered far.

This restaurant gets it right every time and regardless of which Jun's I go to, it's still made the way I like it.  If you haven't tried their BBQ Chicken, you're missing out.  It's about 8 oz of the most tastiest chicken one could ever want.  I even double the order when I really am striving for more protein.  I also got their Chicken Katsu, which was just okay.  Jun's really hooks up the Katsu.  It's almost double in size compared against other Hawaiian/Japanese Restaurants.  Only issue, it was a bit bland.  Good presentation, but lacking taste in the chicken.  I found this ironic since their BBQ chicken is the bomb. \n\nOverall, I'm just excited that I found this place. I have to thank Yelp for this.

The menu's not huge but that's fine; what they do they do well, I think, which is how the best Korean restaurants generally swing.  And if you want spicy, you get spicy.  They have a scale of 1-5, and at most places I get 5, but here I got 3 and that was hot enough for me.  4-5 would be even hotter.\n\nMy favorite is the spicy beef soup (listed in Korean as \"haejangguk\" although it's not the usual variation of haejungguk I've had at other places, no matter, it was still good.  Try it if you're hung over.)   My sister got the stone pot bibimbap, and I was pleased to see fernbraken and bellflower root, which most bibimbaps in America lack.

Here tea's an extra $1.95, which irritates me, and that sikhye stuff at the end of the meal is $2.95, though I'll let that one slide since I don't prefer it anyway.  \n\nThen refills on side dishes (of which they don't give you a lot to begin with) are an extra 25 cents each -- while that's reasonable, you get free refills at most Korean restaurants.   The side dishes also try a little bit too hard, in my opinion.  The napa & radish kimchi were good, but the broccoli didn't need to be breaded & fried (esp. since it was kinda cold), the pancake had too many extras in it and the potato salad was a bit too sweet, though the cherries were a nice touch.

I say \"almost-authentic\" only because most of the dishes are slightly sweeter and milder than its original Korean counterparts, and they have quite a few ingredient substitutions that make it more appealing to American palates. Because of this, I think the label \"fusion\" is justified, especially in case a hard-core native Korean (like me) came in and started making a ruckus because their soup/stew wasn't spicy enough. Or you never want to insult the huge population of Koreans in Madison as well.  \n\nThis was my second visit (both for lunch) and I had the pleasure of bringing along my sister, a long-time Madison resident, who was hesitant about Korean food especially after disappointing visits to New Seoul, the other Korean restaurant in town. I told her that my first visit was pretty good and this second one would be for validation. Luckily for both so us, we were both very pleased with our dishes--spicy bulgogi, soft tofu soup, and a side of jin mandu (steamed dumplings). We got them at the spiciest level 5 and they surprisingly cleared both our sinuses in no time, something that we are accustomed to when eating traditional Korean food. The only quirk I had was the egg roll on my plate, seeming totally out of place on a bulgogi dish, but then again that's where \"fusion\" comes in. \n\nAs for service, the American waiter was very nice, prompt, and knowledgeable about the food--no issues there. The ambiance and atmosphere was better than your normal Korean restaurant, which oftentimes skimp out on quality decor to save money. Actually, it wouldn't surprise me if they hired an interior designer or consultant to give the place a more rustic, Asian charm. We both thought the Korean figurines and ornaments were a nice touch to the place. As for the budget, the price is on the higher end, but it's understandable because of logistics and location. The two Korean markets here get their inventory from Chicago, which in turn makes prices slightly higher than your average restaurant.\n\nOverall, I was very pleased with our visit and even more pleased that my sister now has a place to indulge in decent Korean cuisine.

When I saw it on the menu, it seemed rather pricey. However, it was huge and one order would have been enough for four people. The dish consisted of pork belly, oysters, kim chee noodles, jalapenos, garlic, and cabbage. We were also given shrimp sauce and paste. The waiter instructed us to dip the pork in the shrimp sauce and dip the jalapenos and garlic in the bean paste. We then wrapped everything in the cabbage leaves.

Our play was about to start so we said we'd come by in an hour and a half to see if he found it.

Though I think they were a little intimidated by the size of our group. \nWe had to pop out to get some alcohol (beer, wine) as they do not (yet) have a license. There is no corkage fee. \n\nOrdering was simple, well as simple as trying to avoid overloading yourself on the Kimchi. That stuff is in nearly every dish on offer.  I like Kimchi and I know how this can be an acquired taste to some people .. I'll just call it what it actually is : spiced fermented vegetables. Yup.. fermented.  \nTraditionally -  Kimchi was often allowed to ferment underground in jars for months at a time. MONTHS! \nThis kimchi is such a national Korean condiment or dish that it can be compared to tomato ketchup for Americans or mayonnaise for the Dutch. \nThus here we have a menu that offers Kimchi in Pancakes, spring rolls, dim sum, rice, noodles, salads, meat and seafood dishes. (There was no kimchi flavoured ice cream on offer at their restaurant.. but I am sure that will exist.! (in fact I just Googled it and I am gobsmacked..) \n\nAnita and I were so close to the BBQ that we we wondered where the H&S signs where - \"Caution Hot Surface\" or \"Do Not Touch When red light is on\" would be appropriate warnings for people with less common sense.  I on the other hand could not stop playing with it. It simply showed some Korean characters lighting up in Blue, Red or Green when pressed  (ooh shiny) - there also was a heat controller and a reassuring heat level indicator. - The low tech end of the plug was a little dangerously hoovering above the floor beside the table.

Also a the amount supplied left a bit to be desired.  You had to order rice with it and there wasn't enough salad leaves to go round either.  The bibimbap was tasty - crunchy and well spiced - the soup's flavour did loose against the spiciness of the bibimbap.  \n\nIt is a very much 'hands on' experience and you certainly will have involve most of the guests at your table to do the BBQ. It reminded me of a Chinese Hot Pot, or a raclette, but a bit drier and less ingredients (if you discount the kimchi..) \n\nIn all I was pleased to experience this meal and I now know for next time what to bring in drink and what to order.

My chicken tasted lovely but was rather tough going, with very chewy batter. If I hadn't ordered a side of rice then it would have become monotonous very quickly as the vegetables' flavours were drowned out by the sauce. Not that it wasn't very tasty, but it was just all a bit heavy and glutenous.\n\nI was a bit alarmed by the safety of the barbecue setup; I always laugh at signs that say \"caution: hot\" on obviously hot things, but the noticeable absence of warning on the open skillets set into the tables was surprising. In addition, the hotplate ran off mains power, which meant that the cable trailed under the table and swung perilously a few inches off the ground like a tripwire between the table and the wall-socket, which the people sitting on the other side of the table had to be careful to notice and avoid when getting in and out.\n\nFinally, when I buy a soft drink for a considerable mark-up in a restaurant, it's always easier to push the usual mark-up out of my mind if it's not served as I'd find it in were I to buy it from a shop.

We were shocked and sad to find Shilla closed a couple of weeks ago and hoped to replace it with another good Korean restaurant....\n\nThe service was gruff - not welcoming and warm but not rude, just mechanical. We later realised this was a result of the team (of 4 or 5 including chefs) awaiting a large tour group and then focussing all their attention on it. Must have been important people as we had to endure the waiter pacing up and down for 45 mins before they got there, never once asking if we were ok, and then were ignored on the group's arrival until we got the bill.\n\nThe starters were ok but nothing special; crab stick pancake & deep fried chicken. The chicken had 2 chillies beside it on the menu and was not at all spicy. We were under-impressed from the start. More than half of mains were something with kimchi, so if you don't like fermented cabbage you're in trouble! \n\nWe had a pork and kimchi with rice and a beef bibimbap, with a side of kimchi. The pork was ok but may not have actually been belly. Not much meat either....My bibimbap stone bowl was so hot that over 20 minutes after it was put in front of me it was CONSTANTLY still cooking everythin in the bowl. Consequently the rice at the bottom was stuck to the bottom an inch thru and essentially all burned. It was 3 chilli spicy, apparently, but not AT ALL SPICY. I mixed the tiny amount of veg and egg yolk with the rice an ended upwith a stodgy, burned, tasteless, mess of a dish. I craved a pot of broth to add or something....4 shreds of beef and adding some of the kimchi side improved it marginally but i left almost alll of it as it was inedible and completely unappetising. \n\nNo one asked if our meal was ok. It was still mostly on the table as we paid, without query, and, if I'm honest, I was depressed all night long after it.

I went there on Wednesday, 1/7/09, around 7 p.m., with my BF for his first eat-out Korean dinner. It's in the northwest corner of Dobson and Southern, just north of the gas station, in the same shopping center as Oregano's and Saketini. \n\nMostly, I wanted to try to find tofu soup--crazy-soft tofu pieces in flavorful spicy broth with whatever add-ins you want, from seafood to beef to mushroom to kimchi. YOM. You could smell the spice and sizzle (much of their dishes are served on hot plates, and meat always gives off a certain smell when charred up deliciously like that). Decorations were sparse and the lighting was almost a little too bright, like cafeteria-bright, with the tables and chairs set up diner-style, in neat rows. It wasn't packed (one half of the restaurant, I guess an overflow section, was dark until a couple showed up later), but business was steady. There was a big group of athletic-looking Koreans in the middle of the room having a seriously happy chow-down (everything looked good) and several Korean and mixed families and couples.\n\nThe hostess/waitress waved at us from across the restaurant to ask how many seats we'd need, then waved us to a table. After that, it was a bit of a wait before we got menus. They had an interesting selection, and by that I mean appetizing, choices and decent prices, with entrees starting at $9 and capping in the $20s. They also have a decent selection of lunch specials. It was a somewhat agonizingly long time before anyone came to take a drink order. By the time our polite, attentive waitress came, we were ready to put in our entire order, so we put in for drinks (which came quickly), goon mandu (dumplings) for an appetizer, short ribs, and tofu soup with pork and mushrooms.\n\nThe dumplings came without our getting impatient, and they were pretty tasty--slightly crisped wrappers and plenty of filling. Shortly after we finished, we received our banchan (traditional Korean appetizers on several small plates). I doubt I can remember all of them, but it included kimchi, kak tu gi (radish kimchi), gam-ja (braised potato and carrot), k'ong na mul (bean sprout salad), seaweed salad, and one or two other dishes, which was more than enough for both of us. We thought everything tasted just fine. After we'd enjoyed the banchan for about 5-10 minutes, they brought our little bowls of rice, then our little pile of short ribs on a sizzling plate (with a polite warning not to burn our hands off) served over raw, thickly slivered onions, and after a few moments longer, our tofu soup in a little hot clay pot. They also brought a raw egg in case we wanted one cracked in. \n\nThe ribs were good, but just a little tough--they're supposed to be that way, but if you're expecting something the consistency of all-day braised short ribs, these aren't them. I loved the tofu soup--eat it as soup or over rice, which is ten times better. It was AWESOME, but I\"m biased because it's like comfort food to me. Soft, creamy tofu curds in spicy broth (they ask you how spicy you'd like it, if you want it spicy at all), and just enough pork and mushrooms to still keep it tofu soup. It hit the spot.\n\nThe wait staff was pretty good about keeping my BF's glass of diet coke filled, and that was a feat in itself. It kind of took awhile for someone to bring the check, but when they did, they brought a few tasty coffee candies. We considered desserts, but we couldn't find any in the regular menu or on any special menus.\n\nOverall, the service may have been a little slow, but it wasn't for lack of trying--plating and delivering and clearing the banchan plates alone can be a Herculean task. We really enjoyed the food and plan to go back again.

The marinate\\sauce was not overpowering and they were very tender.  I will for sure order these again.\n\n* BBQ chicken - not the leanest or best cut of chicken but it was very good and flavorful.  Again, the sauce\\marinade was not too strong.\n\n* Octopus in spicy sauce - this was the \"crazy\" dish for me for the evening.  I enjoy fried calamari and squid/octopus salad, but larger chunks of squid or octopus scare me a little.  I mean they weren't real big chunks but big enough to where you see you are eating a bunch of those little suction cup thingys that octopi have.  Between that and the chewiness of each bite made my stomach turn a bit.  However, the dish had good flavor and a nice kick thanks to the red sauce they bathed it in.

Apparently that means zero spicy or just adding 3 jalapeno slices into the soup.  That's authentic right?  They also use a very runny type of tofu, not the more firm stuff I have and like at my other spot.  It really had the texture of egg whites.  In fact, it had the exact texture of the egg white that was also in the soup.  So it was just watery flavorless broth, with textureless tofu and textureless egg b/c it wasn't hot enough to properly cook the egg.  Factor in the tough mushrooms that were obviously re-hydrated and you have a very poor dish.  \n\nThey stiffed us bowls or plates, unless they expected us to reuse the salad bowls so we had to wait around for a while to ask for something to eat on.

I ate here so often that at one point I was a \"Mayor\" on FourSquare and \"Duchess\" on Yelp!  They've changed ownership twice since 10 years ago, and the new one took over about 4-5 years ago I believe.  Their food's ok, but the best thing on the menu is their kimchi jjigae.  That's the reason why I came here all those times and I don't even touch their banchan, because it's so subpar compared to LA, SF, or NYC that it's laughable.  Their Soon Tofu is average and the Kalbi is average as well.  But you take what you can get here in AZ when you have a craving for Korean food.  \n\nWell, if you're serving mediocre food, at least you expect them to provide really good in service right?  NO!!  I have always been unhappy with their service since day one, but I just dealt with it.  Well, I've just had it today and sort of lost it!  The waiter (in his 20s, about 5'11\" tall) who speaks fluent Korean and Enliglish, just pushed me over the edge!  WTF??  Are you kidding me??  I could not believe the service I was getting from this guy!  OK so here's what happened.\n\nI ordered 1 Soon Tofu Jjigae with only beef,  2 lunch special Kimchi jjigae, 1 Lunch special kalbi, 1 lunch special kalbitang. (5 total items)  He brought the banchan (side dishes) and rice and asked me if I wanted eggs in \"all of our soon tofu jjigae.\"  I said I only ordered one soon tofu.  Then he said I ordered 2 kimchi soon tofu, 1 beef soon tofu, 1 kalbi, and 1 kalbitang!  I said \"no I didn't\" and I repeated what I ordered.  Then he argued with me and said \"Yes you did! You ordered 3 soon tofu, plus kimchi jjigae, kalbi, and kalbitang!\"  I said \"are you kidding me right now?  Look here!  We're only 4 people!  Why would I order so many soups for?\"  The guy must be a moron, because he can't even count how many people there are to be ordering 7 items?  Do we look like we could eat that much?  We were two slim adults, and two kids under 15!!  Then he let out a big sigh and then stomped off to fix the order at the kitchen.  He comes back with our food and he literally bangs the soup bowl onto the table!  He is obviously emanating a negative attitude, bangs down the rest of the stuff and stomped off.  I just shook my head and we started to eat.  Half way through the lunch we needed more rice and napkin so I called him over since he was bringing stuff to the next table.  He obviously heard me and didn't bother turning around.  OK, so I'm thinking to myself, maybe he didn't hear me.  I call him again second time and he pretended he didn't hear me.  Then the third time, I called him loud enough for the whole restaurant to hear me and then he turns around, rolls his eyes, makes a face and then comes over.  I couldn't believe my eyes!!  I asked him \"are you giving me an attitude right now?\"  then he yells (yes he yelled at a customer) at me and says \"did I even look at you right now?\"  Then he passes by our table, goes to the next table and \"politely\" asks  \"may I take your order?\"  WTF?  I asked him to help me get something and he completely ignores me?  \n\nOk so let's recap here.  He takes the order wrong, puts in 2 too many orders of Soon Tofu, then gets mad at me when I correct him that isn't so, then he practically throws the food at us banging every chance he gets, and then he ignores me when I call him!  OMG!  At this point, I'm FURIOUS!  I get up and go talk to the owner who happens to be there today.  I reiterate everything that just happened and he doesn't say anything but to just look towards the direction of the kitchen!  Then I say to him \"is it ok for the server to do that to a customer\" and he turns and apologized.  He said that it's his fault for not training the staff correctly.  OK, so I'll take that for an apology, but then he should go quietly talk to the server, have the server come over and apologize to me personally!  Nope, that never happened, and guess what happened next?  The owner comes over to our table, being extra nice, and says he's going to take care of our lunch on the house.  At this point, I'm still shaking from rage and I can't even eat anymore.  I said I'm not making a scene, because I want free lunch.  I'm going to pay for what needs to be pay for, I don't want free lunch.  So while the owner's talking to me at our table, that server is standing near the kitchen talking to another server, looking directly at me, and laughing at me!  WOW!   Just amazing!  I've dined out at so many restaurants over the years in my life at all different levels, from Michelin starred to hole-in-the-wall scary places, but this was just the worst service ever!!\n\nStay far away from this place!

However, I've lived in both LA and SF for several years each, so I could be a harsh critique here.\n\nThis is the only Korean restaurant in Tempe (aside from the one-offs like Paradise Hawaiian BBQ) and so you're not exactly picking from a bunch anyway. The food tends to be well-portioned, though many of the dishes had been pre-cooked and are just heated to order (i.e. Yukkaejang). My biggest discontent is the price, which is quite expensive comparing against the price level of other Korean restaurants I've been to, and absurdly expensive when compared against the other restaurants of similar caliber in Arizona.\n\nThe best thing happening here is the pancake, so definitely try it out if you're new to Korean food. It's about $13 (maybe even $15?) and serves as a great appetizer to split between 3-4 people. Don't go for the happy hour stuff-- they are puny in portion.\n\nThe second best thing happening here is the service, though it depends on who you get. The younger servers tend to be really friendly, well-spoken, and willing to take your fight to the kitchen for you. For example, my Yukgaejang (spicy noodle soup) showed up with no noodles-- the girl server had the kitchen serve me a whole side bowl of noodles and soup for free!

We were originally planning to go to Monta Ramen however, they were extremely busy so we decided to try this place instead.

First of all my vegetarian friend's noodles arrived and had loads of fish in it. EVEN THOUGH SHE TOLD US THAT THEY WOULDN'T PUT FISH IN IT. So, we asked the waitress if we could get a replacement dish (WITHOUT MEAT) OR just get it taken off the tab. (This is standard practice at most restaurants) But she told us that she didn't recall such a request and told my friend to just pick out the fish. So, my friend tried to pick out the fish and eat the noodles but lost her appetite. \n\nMeanwhile my friends who ordered their bulgogi (that was to be grilled) arrived already cooked. And one of them actually received chicken....And we so we calmly told the waitress that their order was wrong. She disagreed with us and told us that our order was correct! I eventually told her that SHE WAS WRONG because WHY would we sit at a table with a GRILL and order meat that was ALREADY COOKED. She then became VERY defensive and accused us of trying to take advantage of her and try to order food for free.

The only thing she got right was the kimchi jjigae....We asked her why she charged us for all of this when we clearly weren't happy with our food and even told her that we hardly ate any of it.

Let's review.\n\nThe space itself is really nice, although small, with gorgeous wallpaper, red lacquered tables and little stone 'pillows' for your spoons and chopsticks. It's that sort of attention to detail that I appreciate. The service was good as well, the servers were all kind and courteous. The menu is fairly extensive, with something for everyone's tastes, and a good number of traditional Korean dishes and loads of seafood. Nom.\n\nWe ordered the pork and squid bulgogi and hot pot with tofu and clams. The flavors were incredible, especially the bulgogi - tender pork, even more tender squid, cooked to spicy perfection. We cleaned that place instantaneously. The hot pot was quite good as well, although there was an abundance of onions and only five lonely clams in the whole bowl. They were so good, I wanted more of them! This is part of the reason why Shilla falls short of a five-star experience. The other reason was the banchan - I'm likely spoiled, but I'm used to plentiful, bottomless banchan and at Shilla we only received four dishes (and kimchi wasn't even included! sacrilege!) and once they were empty, they were gone. \n\nAfter we were done eating and our dishes were cleared and we mentioned that we were all finished now, thank you very much, we were made to wait for a good ten-fifteen minutes while the servers cleared tables and sat new arrivals. We finally had to ask for the check specifically. Am I missing something, or is it customary to marinate once one is finished with one's meal and sitting at an empty table?\n\nI think once my expectations have been lowered a bit, I could definitely enjoy Shilla for the great Korean food and amazing flavors - but don't expect plentiful portions or an abundance of banchan.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 3, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I've been so up and down in my opinions on Shilla. I've been back since my first review, and I always come out with the same feeling of 'meh' but this time, I feel the need to share as although ultimately I don't think I will change my overall view of the place, but I did have to call out the customer service, as I was rather happy with it. \n\nFor my initial starter, I had ordered a special, as had the boy - and they were all out. So, without a menu in front of me, I opted for pa jeon, but requested no pork, as I don't eat meat. I love the pancakes at Korean restaurants, so bad, but so good, especially when stuffed with kim chee as this one was. When it arrived, I started tucking in. \n\nAnd that's when it went south (a little) as the pork wasn't taken out. Luckily for me, I hadn't noticed, but about 5 mins after it arrived, our waiter came rushing in and grabbed it from the table, apologising profusely, and not just him, but about 3 people appeared. I was a bit horrified myself. Once removed, another (without pork) was swiftly delivered - and I definitely could taste the difference then. \n\nI'll admit, I would have been blissfully ignorant as there was nothing ostensibly meaty about the dish, and I did order what was supposed to be a meat dish, so I didn't get angry - what was the point? The guys working there were so clearly upset on my behalf, it would have been like kicking a small puppy. Later, one waiter offered me a free bottle of sake (as the first one had me on the floor, I didn't take him up on it) and when the bill arrived, the pa jeon was conspicuously absent. \n\nSo, the reason I update my review is this - I have been to other places and found meat in my meal (in Vegetarian dishes none the less) - and have literally been asked to pay for the bit where the meat wasn't. I've had apologies but still been billed. It was nice to see that the staff at Shilla were so concerned that the pork hadn't been taken out of the dish and in a place where I tear apart places with poor customer service, it is only fair to praise those who provide the exact opposite.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Had a great meal here on Saturday night.

On that note, one of the things I really like about Korean cuisine is that it hasn't stabilised into the land of generic as of yet... I expect each Korean place I end up in to be different to the last, so that has been taken into consideration for this review and I still walked away a bit underwhelmed.\n\nThere are positive notes however, in that rice and salad leaves came with the bulgogi versus having to be ordered separately, but that's certainly not enough to tempt me to order the same dishes here again.

Good point...\n\nThat being said... we went in and the owner recognized my Father. My father goes.. you remember me?? The owner goes... yes of course!!! The story behind this was.. when my relatives from Korea were in town.. they literally came here every single day for two weeks. They Loved their soups and thought it was better than Tofu Hut.

It's a Korean tradition back home I swear!!!\n\nWe all ordered their Oxknee Soup.. which is #5 on the top list of food picture you see on the right side when you walk in or in the menu book .. under Soup.. it's #3 called Beef Knee Bone Soup.

The broth is milky, beige from all the slow cooking from the bones of the meats. It's so soothing and tasty. I loved it!!! I added tons of sliced green onion and a tablespoon of salt, but you can determine how much you want. The tendons were soft, jelly-like chewy texture... only a few were somewhat firm in chewing. If the pieces are too big to put in your mouth, there's a scissor to cut it in pieces.. which is also used for the two types of kimchi they give you. One is napa cabbage and the other is daikon radish... it comes in two thick dark jars and an endless amount of kimchi to your hearts desire!!! There's a separate dish, where you place the kimchi's to cut into pieces and add to the soup or eat as a condiment. They first bring out six complimentary pieces of deep fried zucchini.. then the kimchi. We were also given a jalapeno, daikon, and diced onion marinated in soy sauce to eat on the side with the soup.\n\nThe daikon radish kimchi was perfectly fermented that it had a great crunch and crisp, fresh taste to it. My mother commented on how good it was. They also give you a sauce to dip the tendons in, which consist of soy sauce and hot mustard.. you mix it together and dip the tendon or should I say coat the tendon in and eat it with the bowl of rice... sip the broth of the soup after and it all goes down so well. Delicious, soothing, and perfect for a cold winter night or day!\n\nThey provide barley tea and at the end.. you get a free cup of cold, refreshing sweet rice drink for dessert.

My father told me when you eat this soup, you won't get hungry for a long time. It was very filling, but in a good way. It just relaxes you...

I wished they put the clotted blood cakes into the dish, but I am guessing that is what they blacked out on the menu and board. The soup was good enough to get three stars from me, but it was the kimchi that has me at a four. The pot of cabbage kimchi is the best I have had in Vegas. Other places skimp on the red  pepper mixture leaving theirs bland, sometimes sweet, and lacking of flavor. Not at E-Jo.

It's so hidden it couldn't even be found if you combined the ten best treasure hunters in the world and gave them all the tools they needed to find the damn gem. Fortunately for my friends, I am better than those ten treasure hunters and all I needed was my Blackberry. I'm simply the best at finding hidden gems. \n\nTo be honest, my group wandered to Ma Dang on a rainy day haphazardly. We were aiming for a cheap restaurant after Las Vegas ate our wallets and my Yelp App on Blackberry led us 15 minutes away from the strip to Tokyo Japanese Restaurant. The reviews seemed all good despite a $20 taxi ride. Unfortunately for us, Tokyo Japanese Restaurant had closed down and Yelp had not changed the business status - shame on Yelp. While walking around, it was evident the economic turmoil had hit Vegas hard, especially for the restaurants off-strip. Every establishment was closed with crows and pigeons taking over the sidewalks. It felt like the scene from a Resident Evil movie and my friends seemed possessed with the same demonic affliction the zombies had as I felt their stone cold glares. I could telepathically read their minds, strings of \"where did you take us\", \"why am I wasting my time\" and \"I'm hungry\" lingered. Then there was finally a sign of relief just as emotions were about to boil over, as we saw a family walk into a nondescript blue door. We followed and meekly peeked in. An ahjima greeted us at the door and got us seated. We were nervous and skeptical of what they were going to feed us. Seriously, thoughts of them serving us human meat ran through my mind as the desolate mini-mall seemed incredibly ominous. \n\nThe $10-$15 dishes were such a reprieve of the astronomical strip prices that we decided to pig out. However, we were cautious and ordered the typical Korean fare. Duk bok ki, Haemul Pajun, Soon Doobu Jigae, Dol Sot BiBimBap and Jap Chae. The ahjima also recommended the Spicy Chicken, noting tourists love the dish.  We ordered and we waited...\n\nThe dishes came out one by one. Huge portions, I mean absolutely worth the money we paid and a change of pace from the high-class, fancy restaurants on the strip. Each dish had a homemade feel to them and served in huge plates. The restaurant was also not cheap on the banchan and provided a table full of small appetizers. Our party of 5 undoubtedly over ordered, but it didn't matter to us as we were just happy to spend $20 each and be stuffed. There were no laggards and each dish was masterfully crafted as if I was over my Korean friend's house. However, the standout was truly the Spicy Chicken. It was unlike any other Korean fried chicken I have ever tasted and I have probably tasted the best of them including BonChon and KyoChon. The sauce used for the Spicy Chicken was indescribable and the chicken was tender and moist, the star dish of the restaurant.\n\nUnfortunately the restaurant is so far and hidden from the strip and the rest of the Las Vegas, as well as being surrounded by failed establishments, that it has not gotten enough fanfare. I would recommend any local Las Vegas resident to visit this restaurant and try out the menu. I really want to get Ma Dang's name out and I hope this review does that.

No chilled metal cups, but the tall plastic ones will do. \n\nThe food is similar price to other Korean restaurants in Vegas, but that is the only similarity they share.

Instead they had a beef brisket (9.99), tripe, tongue, and an all of the above soup (13.99). My sister and I split the beef brisket and the cold buckwheat noodles in a chilled soup (9.99). The former was steaming hot with generous amounts of meat and noodles. It comes with a bowl of rice, a huge pot of cabbage and radish kimchi, and lots of green onions to sprinkle in. The best way to eat it is to throw your rice into the broth and add gochujang (the red chili paste). A dash of salt goes a long way too. Like seullongtang, you need to season it to your liking, otherwise it might be too bland. Another way I learned to eat it, in Korea, was to add a little bit of the juice from the radish kimchi. It might sound odd, but the taste is amazing. \n\nThe naengmyeon is a true summer dish. The tangy vinegar beef broth is chilled with the addition of ice cubes. It comes with half a hard boiled egg, two pieces of brisket, pickled radish, cucumbers, and a horseradish mustard on the side.

I was completely curious about the location in Chinatown across from ChinaMama because I don't read Korean...so when I saw the yelp listing - finally - with a picture of the building, I was thrilled to know what was inside!  Last week when my husband and I were headed downtown to the arepa cart, I noticed this E-Jo location for the first time...I've probably driven past it 100 times and never seen it... \n\nYesterday, as the city baked in 110+ degree heat, I knew I wanted something cold for lunch - when I saw David S.'s review of this location and his mention of the cold buckwheat noodles in chilled soup, I had to go.  \n\nThere was one other table who'd just been seated when I arrived.  The server looked at me initially with great suspicion, which concerned me.  Once she saw me dig into the kimchis, she relaxed.  Actually, a gentleman from the other table came over and asked \"So? Do you like it?\"  He explained he wasn't used to seeing 'folks like me' order the buckwheat noodles - he commended me for ordering such a healthy dish, too.   I thought it was brilliant.  I wasn't expecting the ice cubes to still be in the broth - but they were - this was unlike anything I'd ever had before - and I loved it.  Buckwheat noodles are chewy, so chewy they sort of bite back - in fact, I couldn't bite through them...those scissors for the kimchi came in extra handy.  Bottom line, this isn't a dish you can eat quickly...which is also why I loved it so.

So over the years I have driven past this unassuming restaurant that practically blends in with the other random businesses on this stretch of E Sahara, and never really given it a second thought.  So I am glad that we the typical question about where to get dinner ultimately lead us to E-Jo Korean Restaurant.\n\nTheir menu is pleasantly simple. Just 2 pages worth, and almost all of it is dedicated to the various traditional Korean soups not found at other Korean restaurants. These soups are the final product of hours of slow simmering to extract the flavors from the beef bones used in its preparation.  You can order the soup according to the meats and other ingredients that you want served in it.  If you are a beginner, then go with item #1 (Brisket Beef Soup for $9.99). If you are adventurous, then order item #8 (Their Combination Beef Soup with all the ingredients listed in items 1-7).\n\nThe soups themselves are what many would considered bland, but that is completely intentional. And sea salt is available on the table for diners to adjust their soup to their individual taste (very good for individuals with high blood pressure or are on a low sodium diet, since it is easy to add salt but impossible to get it out).  Besides that, there are Korean spicy chili paste and another soybean paste and garlic mixture for flavoring the soup or as a dip for the cucumber chili (most were not spicy, but there were a few that did packed some heat, so be careful if you don't like it too spicy).\n\nIn the end I opted for item #3 (Beef Knee Bone Soup with Tendon, $13.99).  If you like soft tendons, there are a lot of it in here, but no other pieces of beef.  Overall, this alone was just okay for me even with all of the tinkering that went into fine tuning my soup.\n\nThe surprised highlight of the meal for me and probably everyone I ate with (Michael K and Roger T) is the restaurant's house made kimchi (2 varieties: radish and cabbage).  As far as banchans are concerned relative to other Korean restaurants, the selection is minimal.  However, what the E-Jo lack in kimchi selections is more than make up by the quality and flavors that they packed.  I will be happy with a few servings of rice and their kimchi, and maybe just a small bowl of soup or side order of Stir Fried Ribeye or Spicy Pork.  The kimchis are that mind blowningly good!  Forget the other K-Restaurant's commercially sourced industrial kimchis.  I want E-Jo's artisanal kimchi goodness!\n\nService was friendly and efficient. The food came out with nominal wait time.  You can help yourself to as much kimchi as you want.  However, be polite and considerate and get the kimchi out of the jar with the provided tongs and put it on the serving plate first (no ones wants your cootie crossed contaminated double dipped leftover kimchi, not even your GF or BF).\n\nIn the mood to drink responsibly?  They offer, you guessed it, Soju!  Plus Korean beers and rice wines and soda for me.\n\nFor entertainment, besides staring at your iPhone or Android devices and neglecting your dining companions (okay if you are Yelping, but only because I am Yelping too), catch up on Korean programming of the variety show category on their TV (at least that was what was on at the time of my visit).  \n\nAfraid of ordering wrong because you are not Korean, can't speak Korean, but you still want to madly impressed your Korean GF or just being  culinaryly (I am making up words because of their kimchi) adventurous minus the requisite language skill, have no fear! pictures of menu items are on the wall for easy visual reference.  Or just ask the restaurant staff taking your order, silly.\n\n(Getting the frantic hand signals to wrap it up)\n\nE-Jo, a good Korean soup restaurant to visit, especially as the thermometer starts dipping towards your feet.  Lastly, awesome kimchi!\n\n4 stars! **** out of *****\n\nTrivial observation: Their soups all look the same to me here.  But I can assure you I am not a soup racist. I have had soups from many culinary traditions in the past. Just the other day I thoroughly enjoyed a miso soup, and before that an Italian Wedding Soup, and a very invigorating cold Borscht from Russia (or was it or Ukrainian origin) just over the summer.

The Korean restaurants im used to are the cook it yourself all you can eat table top grill kinds. So I was curious as to how this place works.\n\nFrom looking at the menu it looks simple enough. Everything has a number and is in Korean and English. Since I didn't really want to be that adventurous, I chose the #1 Beef Brisket Soup. It's your basic soup with Beef Brisket and Noodles. \n\nNow this is where I learned something new. You season the soup yourself meaning they don't put any spices whatsoever in it. On every table there are containers of salt with a mini spoon. For those that are looking for a low to no sodium meal, this is your soup to get! What I ended up doing was grabbing the meat from my soup and eating it with the steamed rice they give you. I would also mix in a little bit of the hot sauce and curry sauce that was provided as well as mild green peppers. \n\nWhat actually stole the show was the Kimchi. I have had it before but when I had some of theirs, it tasted really fresh. What I find out was that they make it themselves from scratch. That explains why it was so good. Definitely not from a jar you would be able to buy at Seafood City or Ranch Market.\n\nService was good. We had a sweet old lady that looked like she would not be able to understand us or speak English well. I was pleasantly surprised when she spoke perfectly good English to us. She was very helpful in answering any questions we threw at her.\n\nAs for the place and overall location, I gotta admit, I drive by this place all the time and never really noticed it. Shame on me. But then again, it is in a weird part of the east side of Sahara when most of the food places are on the west side.

So when I yelped for this specific soup, E-Jo came up! And I know, I know, soondubu is just as good during the winter -- maybe even better cause it's spicy! But come on! Everywhere that's Korean in Vegas serves soondubu. Can we get some variety?!?!! \n\nNow that's what sets E-Jo apart from a lot of other Korean places. Because if you're looking for your typical Korean BBQ Restaurant joint that you're used to, this is definitely not it. E-Jo gives me the feeling of a mom and pop joint. What's better is that a majority of the items on their menu are new to me! \n\nWhen my friend and I arrived at E-Jo, the area around the restaurant was a little shady and quite dark. So being the paranoid me, I would say always go with someone. But right when we walked into the restaurant, we immediately got greeted in Korean. Not only that but she asked us how many in Korean too. I don't know about you but I was confused but still loved it. Nothing beats authenticity. \n\nThe menu wasn't anything spectacular. It didn't have a trillion options for you to choose from and it was easy to follow. The waitress came by to take our orders and I just had to ask her, \"Do you have seolleongtang?\" Why would I ask that since some of the yelp reviews have confirmed it to be seolleongtang? Well, the menu didn't have it.\n\nShe pretty much told me, \"Yes and no.\" Then she explained that their #1 on the menu, beef brisket soup, is very closed to seolleongtang however it's a little different. I couldn't really remember exactly what she said but she mentioned about the ingredients being a bit more expensive in their version but it's very close. With that, both my friend and I ordered their beef brisket soup for dinner. \n\nShe gave us extra green onions, hot pepper paste, peppers, meat sauce, and bean paste (I think). As for banchan, there was only two: kimchi and spicy radish. I thought it was quite interesting because I've never been given actual peppers before and I have also never been given meat sauce or hot pepper paste when I ordered seolleongtang before. I'm not a big kimchi fan but even so, I find their kimchi to be very good. It looked and tasted fresh. I liked the radishes as well but I typically like radishes with more vinegar haha. \n\nThen our soup came -- relatively quick I might say. I do have a warning though. Those who are used to flavors, msg, and thick broths ... this isn't going to be like that. The beef brisket soup is, for the lack of a better word, bland. Or to us Chinese, we call it \"ching\" which is clean. But it's okay! For all you sodium lovers or those who just want a bit more flavor, there is salt on every table! You can adjust the salt to your liking, which is what I love most about this soup. And oh, she was right, their beef brisket soup is VERY close to seolleongtang. One of the differences I've noticed is that E-Jo's noodles are white versus the clear glass noodles I'm used to. Also, E-Jo's broth base seems a bit thinner compared to what I've had before. In the end, everything is dandy. I got to have what I've been craving for :D\n\nOver all, awesome service tonight. Attentive workers. Yummy food. Win for me.

They offer a variety of beef-based broths containing a variety of cuts ranging from brisket, oxtail, and tongue to a variety of other tender bits such as tripe, tendon, and intestine.  The broth has a milky white complexion that can only be achieved from boiling down beef bones for several hours under a low simmer achieving a rich and nourishing soup perfect for a cold winter day or when one is under the weather or post-hangover.   \nSea salt and pepper are provided at the table to adjust the broth to optimum taste and along with the choice of meat, some silky threads of somyeon (wheat flour) noodles and fresh green onion complete the dish.  \n\nAccompaniments include a refreshing glass of barley tea, a few raw green peppers (not spicy, although they look like banana peppers, presumably as a palate cleanser?), and two artisan jars containing perhaps the best made-in-house kimchi in town in the form of radish and napa cabbage cut down table side to bite-size portions by one of the staff.  For the final fine-tuning of flavors, some ground red chili paste and additional green onion are provided for the broth and a spicy soybean paste and horseradish/wasabi based soy sauce for dipping the meats.  Other options include a few choices of grilled meats, nyangmyeon, and a soup with homemade dumplings/rice cakes which have also been well-received in other reviews.\n\nA true mom/pop joint devoid of pretense that delivers homecooked Korean goodness to nourish the body and soul.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 4, "useful": 16, "cool": 13}}, {"text": "Went here for an early lunch before catching my flight.

Not your typical Kornz joint you may be used to, but still worth a try.  \n\nNow I'm no expert, by any stretch of the imagination, but it seems as though a lot of people think Korean restaurants all include DIY BBQ, Which is not the case at all. Although a misnomer, many people also refer to Korean BBQ as Yakiniku, which is Japanese Hibachi grilling (Oh Jah, Tanaka of Tokyo, Benihana, etc.).  Sorry, E-Jo does not fall into that category. \n\nE-Jo is a great place if you want some legit Korean food, minus the complication... No smelling or feeling like a fry cook and little fuss with the set menu.  Although limited, the menu gets down to the nitty gritty with their signature dishes.  They have a more expanded list of soup including knee bone, oxtail and I hear the assorted soup gives you a variety.  Otherwise, the entrees include your typical rib eye steak (bulgogi), spicy chicken (dakgalbi), and marinated beef short ribs (soegalbi our galbijim).  You may see a lot of places with \"Kalbi\" and I learned that \"k's\" are pronounced like a \"g,\" but could be wrong and invite insight from my Korean Yelpers. \n\nSo The dishes were good and was kicked off by the fresh kim chee and daikon.  I suppose the only DIY was not the BBQ, but instead the \"cut your own Kim chee.\"  The rest of the dishes (bulgogi, galbijim & dak galbi) were good and flavorful.  The bulgogi was on point and the spicy chicken and pork were delish too.  I recommend just sticKing to one or the other though since they are both made with gochujang.  The pleasant surprise was the extremely clean broth in the oxtail soup.  For the uninitiated, it is not salty and boasts natural beef bone flavor. \n\nThe only disappointment was the absence of the vast array of appetizers (Banchan).

Korean BBQ or Mr. Tofu.  After checking out their small and simple menu at Mr. Tofu, we decided we liked the 'full' Korean experience that D.J.K. was offering.\n\nWith no wait on the past Memorial Holiday for dinner, we were seated at  a booth right smack in the middle.  After perusing their extensive menu, we opted for their Dwaeji Galbi (Grilled Pork Ribs) at $22.95, the BF's favorite of Bulgogi Dolsot Bibimbap (Steamed rice with vegetables and beef to mix in the hot stone pot) at $14.95, and the Mul Naengmyeon (Buckwheat noodles with vegetables and meat in chilled broth) at $8.95 based on their picture.\n\nAbout nine different banchan was brought to us after our order went in.  It included cabbage kim chee, bean sprouts, salad, marinated octopus with pickled cucumbers, daikon, omelet, raw garlic, sliced jalapenos, broccoli and some kind of dipping paste.  The salad had a nice dressing to it, and was pretty good.  The octopus was pretty yummy as well.\n\nWe soon discover they are out of Dwaeji Galbi, and ordered the Sanggalbi (Premium beef short ribs) at $26.95 instead.  The beef was good. It wasn't fabulous for the price we paid.  The Bulgogi Dolsot Bibimbap was average.  At first, the rice seemed a bit mushy.  But the stone pot that it came it really crisped up the rice very well.  (Apparently, this was the best the BF has ever had in terms of crispiness.)  The Mul Naengmyeon didn't quite look like the picture it was presented in.  It came with two slices of beef, one hard boiled egg, some veggies, and few pine nuts.  We asked the waitress about it before ordering and she was honest in her opinion, noting that although she enjoys it, it's a bit different for other people.  It's a cold noodle soup dish and I found it refreshing on a hot day.  They also give you vinegar and horseradishy mustard to mix it up with and this gives the broth the much needed quick.  \n\nBack in the city, I'm used to getting tea automatically.  But I guess here, you have to ask for it.  At least they don't charge for it though.\n\nI like how the tables are set up here.  At other Korean restaurants, they have to bring this container of hot coals to your table and it's pretty dangerous.  But here, they just turn it on with their gas stove.  And if you aren't going to cook the meat yourself, they simply put the cover on and it's flat like the rest of your table.  \n\nThe BF was still eating when the cashier girl brought our check to the table.  She didn't even bother asking if we wanted dessert.  (They offer creme brulee, ice cream, etc.)  Asking if they had any shikhye and learning they did not, we were a bit disappointed.  (Had to visit the Asian supermarket next door to get some!)\n\nService - we had the long-haired waitress.  There's this one short-haired waitress that was not so friendly.  When she initially asked us if we were ready to order, and we asked for another minute, she made a \"Huff!\" sound.  The BF and I looked at each other like, \"WTF?!\"  Thank goodness the smiley long-haired waitress ended up serving us the rest of the evening and she made up for the bad customer service of the other one.\n\nSide note: The restrooms have these gigantic square sinks.

Its the Asian invasion of Vegas. Felt like we were explorers who discovered China (oooops I guess it is hard to \"discover\" since a lot of people live there, to digress even further:  there is a movement to change the record that Chinese merchant seaman discovered America many of hundreds of years before you know who sailed the ocean blue in 1492).

Well we had 3 in our 'party' the other groups each had 4+ people. Low and Behold a table for 3 comes up. It was kinda like that old slot machine (since we are on the Vegas thing) where you win if 3 cherries land on the line....anyhooooo I point this out because the greeter then explains to the 2 other parties that a 3 person bbq table just came up and she would like to sit us there !

We were around the area and decided to eat Korean food since that place was opened all night and had 20% off everything on the menu until 8AM. On first impression walking in, the place seemed clean and spacious with about three booths occupied at that time. The place itself is rather larger than most Korean restaurants, had a cozy feel to it and sits about 60+ people. It was bright with light and seemed suitable for late night gatherings with friends. But, that was about it on the plus side of our experience.\n\nThe only waitress working there did not greet us immediately because she was too busy finishing up the spoon she was drying in her hands before getting to us. She was unfriendly, did not speak understandable English and looked as if she was pissed off because we had walked in and now she had more work to do. She sat us down at the table and I saw her immediately go back to finishing up her spoons. She didn't get us water or anything right away. I know most places, that's considered bad service, but I wasn't that picky to fuss about it at that time.The menu itself was similar to most Korean places. It had tofu soup, bbq and combination plates. Nothing too out of the ordinary, however, the price was about $5 more expensive than most places like Tofu Hut and Mr. Tofu. We got the combo with seafood tofu soup and Korean ribs to share and ordered an extra side of rice for $2. She did not bring our drinks out until we got our side dishes. When we ordered the soup, she didn't ask us about our preferred spice levels and didn't even bother to make eye contact with us or let us know she got the ordered. All she did was write it down, said nothing looking away, and walked off leaving us kind of dumbfounded. \n\nThe side dishes were very skimpy for 2 people. I understood we only ordered 1 thing, but it was a combination that is close to $16 with $2 extra for rice. She didn't care to accommodate the platings for the party at all, even when it was complimentary.  The soup itself came out boiling, but with dried soup spilled on the side of the clay pot. No one bothered to wipe it off. It wasn't like there was a small amount, you could tell a lot of the soup was spilled on the side. The soup itself tasted good, however. I enjoyed the taste greatly, but to be honest, it was the same as every other Korean resturaunt. Nothing that left a big difference. I noticed for the price they charged, our shrimp in the seafood was baby shrimp and very, very tiny.  When our ribs came out at last (the combo pretty much came out one at a time), there was 6 pieces of ribs and looked very dry. What do you know, it was. The ribs itself was not marinated well enough, there was that sesame oil taste, and slightly sweet.. but that was pretty much it for the ribs. I did not enjoy the ribs at all. \n\nThere was 2 people sitting next to us drinking the whole night we were there. On many occasions, I noticed the waitress came over and talk to them, and kept on standing there talking to them in Korean. She payed every attention to that table, and pretty much left us in a corner the whole night. She never bothered to refill our drinks or clean the table that left right when we got there across from us. It was dirty the whole night we were there. She even watched TV and talked to the cook instead of cleaning the table. \n\nOKAY so are you ready for this? One of the guys who were drinking was talking to her before we finished our food. He took out a cigarette and lit it up, smoking in front of our waitress. She did nothing, and continued talking to him in Korean. The other guy smoked afterwards and they both pretty much smoked in the restaurant, with us eating a booth away from them. My boyfriend and I were speechless. They ignored us and kept smoking. At one point, one of the guys got up and with smoke in hand, walked across the restaurant to the restroom hallway. I could not believe how irresponsible this waitress was being. If that was being allowed in the main lobby area, I wonder what goes on in the kitchen where they prepare our foods. I've gone to bars and karaoke lounges where they served food and let us use \"cups\" as ash trays. But that was different than an actual dine in restaurant such as this.

Because it's so disappointing to see how immature and naive some people can be when giving restaurants reviews. To start, the food was pretty good. Service was friendly enough and I love how they come and cut the meat up for you and cook it in front of you. Next, when I looked at the menu I understood some of the reviews about how it can be a bit pricey. Then again 2 nights ago I went to Honey Pig Korean restaurant and the meat there tasted on a scale of 1 - 10 about a 5.5 quality wise. Here at Dae Jang Keum I'd say about a 8.5. Hmm... I wonder why it's more expensive here? Maybe the quality of the beef is better?! Some people are such whiners that they can't figure out the difference between quality and quantity. Yeah go to RM Seafood at Mandalay Bay if you want a T-bone steak but don't expect to go there and ask why the beef here is more expensive than Taco Bell. It's called quality people go google it up or something. That's all for the pricing. Yes it is more expensive than Tofu Hut or Honey Pig but taste and quality wise, I'd give Dae Jang Keum the upper hand. If you don't like to pay extra money for higher quality food, just go to Fat Burger and order a kid's meal because the burgers are huge there and you'll save money and satisfy your hunger.

Basically the dish has two parts: kbbq kalbi and a cold soup with buckwheat (soba) noodles. They liked the Kalbi, but the soup was.... peculiar. It has ice in it! Like they were not joking when they said it would be cold. It was like a soupy slush, lol. There was cucumber, ginger, and jicama in it, as well as some type of meatloaf slices. The soup was sour. I wouldn't say the soup was bad, it was just strange. I guess we're just a family partial to warm soup.\n\nMy brother got the Dolsot Bibimbap, which looked outstanding. \n\nI ordered the Galbitang. Oh my goodness. Their Galbitang is wonderful, and I highly recommend you order it if you ever visit this place. If there is ever a rainy day when you might feel gloomy or if you feel a bit under the weather and just need a warm and cozy pick-me-up, this soup will do you wonders compared to the plain ol' chicken noodle. The soup was brothy and so full of flavor. I was given a very generous portion of meat, too. The noodles were cooked well and the green onion added enough of its own flavor to really make the dish special. I added lots of black pepper to mine and also dumped my rice into the bowl, just as I usually do with this dish. Perfection. \n\nI would like to comment on their Pan Chan (sp? The little side dishes each table is given to enjoy with their meals). There were two particular dishes I wasn't familiar with - the broccoli and the potato salad. Wow! These were lovely additions to the meal! I finished them completely and so quick! The broccoli was steamed and flavored with sesame oil, simple and yummy. The potato salad was chunky, but also creamy -- a potato salad that was mostly potato and not just a plain mixture of several ingredients. This potato salad highlighted the texture and flavor of the potato well and was a pleasant surprise. I tried their kimchi too, which was fine, but the kimchi at Mother's is better.\n\nBecause of the Galbitang, I would definitely visit this place again.

They say that three is the magic number and I find it hard to disagree after my party failed to find a spot for dinner. One place closed down, another didn't open until 6pm, and then it dawned on me that Mr. Tofu was an option. \n\nAlthough it is not in the main Chinatown complex, this plaza holds it's own in culinary delights and Mr. Tofu only adds to it's credibility. Mr. Tofu does not offer a large menu, instead focusing all their efforts onto a single sided page. This reminded me of the specialty restaurants in Korea. Instead of offering a bevy of sub par items, they focus on a few signature dishes. \n\nThe ambiance is simplistic and clean. The restaurant is minimalistic, open, brightly light, and the walls are adorn with a large menu and pictures of what they offer. \n\nThe staff was friendly and quick with the refills on banchan. Not once did we have to request for more. Instead the gentleman swept in with replacements as soon as we devoured. Good thing there was only one other party, because I feel sympathy for anyone who has to serve Katrina M. and I when we feast. The poor guy made four rounds. The broccoli, kimchi, and two radish dishes did not stand a chance. The pickled celery was not in high demand. \n\nBringing along a newbie to Korean food, we ordered and dined family style. I got the kongguksu; a cold, milky soybean noodle soup garnished with cucumber. The noodles are chewy without being rubbery. The soup is a thicker soy milk with pine nuts floating throughout. This dish is not for everyone because it will seem bland, but they offer salt on the side. On a hot day, this refreshing dish is a savior. At ten dollars, it is a filling meal.

My fellow yelpers are correct in their assessment that the banchan is up there amongst the best in town since they are all clean on the palate and are well balanced in seasoning.  \n\nMoving on towards the main event, I would have to give 5 stars for the broth since most places I have frequented it tends to be more soupy and watered down, whereas here, it not only looks nontransparent, but has rich depth in flavor and almost has a creamy texture even though no dairy is involved.

The banchan (side dishes...most of which are pickled) go on a rotation...so it is always a surprise as to what you will receive, but don't be shy there are unlimited refills...my personal favorites are the fish cake, candied potato, and bean sprouts.\n\nSince Mr.Tofu is a generous man, I'm sure he has enough tofu love to spread to all the ladies....and men out there ;)", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 9, "useful": 6, "cool": 7}}, {"text": "Tried the hand made beef noodles.

Yes, it's finally stew weather here at least.  This weather is perfect for the warm, spicy, and hearty tofu soup!  Well, I like stew all year around, hehe: P  \nI had to grab a pot of Sundubu Jjigae at Mr Tofu last Sunday :) I love coming here not only because of the taste of the Soft Tofu Stew but also their Banchans are very fresh and good!  The Korean style soy pickled jalape\u00f1o is my favorite banchan of all time.  I think every Korean family has their own version of this side dish whether it be more sugar or more vinegar.  At Mr Tofu, the pickles are not too salty and just right amount of sweetness(in tangy sweet soy & vinegar sauce).\nTo me, there is something just so perfectly lush about Sundubu Jjigae- all that smooth extra silken tofu, veges, molten egg,  and bubbling hot chili broth,,, it is a heaven! \nI usually dine at Mr Tofu to try different style of Sundubu Jjigae.  One of my favorite is their  Seafood Soft Tofu Stew.  I love having all the shrimps, clams, squid, & mussels in the pot.  Other times, I usually get the thinly sliced beef rib eyes soft tofu stew.  A classic Korean tofu dishes are come with countless variations and I enjoy eating all different flavor of stews.  I think their broth is very consistent each time I had their soft tofu soup.  And they have an unlimited free barley tea if you ask for it.  \nOnce the pot is brought to the table, you will see a single raw egg already been cracked into the bubbling red broth with the silken soft tofu, yum!  Then, I gently stir my tofu stew and taste the spicy broth slowly(usually order mine as a medium hot).  Their broth is rich in flavor yet light in body :P  So Delicious! \nIt's all about quietly waiting for my yummy hot tofu pot to come to my table- a bubbling and fiery red garlic broth of pot.  I finally smile when the waiter speedily brings a vigorous boiling pot.  \nOther than the Tofu stew, I recommend their bibimbap in a hot stone pot. \nI own many small clay pots at home and certainly invested in proper Korean pots. I have tried cooking other Korean Stew but for me, making a real good Korean Style stew is a bit challenging especially creating a great stew like,\" Sundubu Jjigae\" using a meat stock and a fresh fish sauce. \nAt this point, I am going to eat at Mr Tofu whenever I am craving for a warm Tofu soup. \nI remember my family used to tell me that Sundubu Jjigae is a perfect antidote to the flu.\nAnyone wants to have a perfect bubbling bowl of spicy??", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 3, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "My girlfriend has been wanting to eat here for quite some time.

Our waiter took it upon himself to give himself a 18% tip automatically. We were just a party of 4 with a baby. I saw him do the same thing to a Korean couple with three kids. I cant believe he had balls to do that to a fellow Korean.  Some Korean restaurants I go to take care of other Koreans preferentially. C'mon, you know it's true!  At least, our waiter that day was an equal opportunistic,egotistical, person with an endeavor for shady business practices on all people. He took 18%...above average tip (typical for 6 or more in a party) for some lack luster service. He didn't even refill our glasses with water once.  Maybe I wouldn't be so pissed if he just took a 15% tip or if there was something stating gratuity was automatically added to the bill...guess he thought highly of his level of service though.   Hell, if he just refilled our water I would have given him a 20% tip. I was in the F&B industry, I know how it goes. Immaculate service earns 30% from me...easy. Maybe he thought he was the bombdiggity of a server or was just tired of foreigners visiting Vegas and stiffing him. Heck, I sympathize. Europeans and some Asians from abroad don't tip diddly.\n\nIn addition to the tipping escapade, my sister asked our waiter for a bowl behind the counter.  He was unnerved and said he would bring it to our table. 5-7 minutes later the bowl arrived.  He was too busy calculating and counting his tips.  No kidding! The bowl was right behind him. He could have just turned around, grabbed the bowl behind him and handed it to my sister. Unbelievable! I guessed that earned him his auto-tip, in his mind.  Could be a new thing in Vegas too when 5 or more are gratuity included now. Would be nice to know If that's the case.Nothing about gratuity is stated anywhere and he failed to mentioned he added the tip already.  Our bill just had the total. Almost double tipped him.

It comes with Korean Pork, Beef Prime, Neck Flesh of Pork, Hot Baby Octopus, Seafood Bean Paste Soup, Fried Rice, and either 1 bottle of Soju or Korean Beer.\n\nAfter putting in our order, the waiter came back with iced Korean tea.  This was actually the first time I have ever seen the tea served on ice and it was very refreshing.  Something so nice needs to be served in tall glasses instead of small regular tea cups.\n\nAbout nine different banchan was brought over, which included cabbage kim chee, bean sprouts, cucumber kim chee, green onion salad, fish cake, tiny fish, raw garlic, sliced jalapenos, pickled daikon, a bean dipping paste, and my favorite - sesame oil with Korean salt.  He only brought over one dish of each, so we were soon requesting refills on just about everything.\n\nThe raw foods were soon to arrive and the waiter laid out the beef and pork onto the hot wok-like grill in the center.  He also added some bean sprouts and cabbage to the middle.  As we waited for our meat to cook, we dove into the banchan.  We also asked about the rice, which he then brought over five bowls of steamed white rice ($2/each).\n\nAs we devoured our meat and our grill became empty, we sat around wondering about our octopus.  It was sitting in a bowl on the next table, but we weren't sure what to do next since they had shut our fire off.  When we finally got their attention, they asked if we wanted our bill.  We asked about the octopus, and only then did he realize that it was still sitting raw on the next table.  So, he turned on the grill and cooked the octopus.  The BF asked about the soup, and only then did the waiter ask if we wanted our fried rice.  (Uh...yeah!)  We were quite bothered by this since they were already asking us if we wanted to pay and we hadn't received half of our meal still!

We were forgotten about, and I'm not sure if it's because we were in the corner or what.

I asked for more napkins, which never arrived until I asked again.  The different waiters would come by and shut the heat off before our food was cooked and it was just so hard to get their attention.  (One waiter finally mentioned that they were understaffed with only three waiters that night.  They just looked unorganized.)

But this time, we had no-one with us that was Korean (or who spoke Korean), so I had to ask for the rice at the end of the meal. I think it is an additional cost, but well worth it. Remember to leave some room at the last for the rice!\n\n-----------------------------\n\n\n\nKorean BBQ... \n\nWhen I say that I think of the open grill and cooking all the meat I can. But Honey Pig is different. \n\nHoney pig gives you this large pot that looks like an inverted wok sitting over a wok style gas burner. What happens at this BBQ house is that the meat is cooked on this \"dome\".\n\nWe just ordered the \"all you can eat\" choice, I think it was $20 per person (or maybe $25) I can't remember. You can also eat ala carte and they have a bunch of other menu choices.\n\nThe AYCE choice starts you off with with kim chee dishes and kim chee and sprouts on the \"grill\" then the meat comes. We had pork and beef. Oh, they also give you a salad type item, but that is best used for a base to eat the grilled meat...\n\nYou cook the beef and eat up, use the \"salad\", kim chee and sprouts as a base to eat with your meat selections and go to town! After you are almost full, tell the wait staff you are done.\n\nThey will then bring some rice over and put it on the grill, anything left on the grill gets' mixed up in the rice and cooked. Leave the rice on the grill until it cooks up and gets a good crust on the bottom. I equate this to the burnt rice chinese grandma's make. \n\nOnce the rice is ready, just eat up and fill your belly the rest of the way up. I think in hindside, we'd have ordered a little more meat and get it grilling before asking for the rice. (giving the rice more meat)... hee hee...\n\nGrilling the food this way still produces smoke, but not as much smoke as other Korean BBQ places you're used to going to...\n\nIf you plan on going to this place before going out, don't wear your clubbing wear here. go back home and change.

He wasn't too hungry and settled for something from the soup menu, but what we were hoping to order was some good olf fashion traditional Bibimbap (which was not on their menu). After debating if I was hungry enough to order AYCE or try to find something that appeals to me from the rest of the menu, I went for the dinner AYCE.\n\nThere are 2 items that you can only order once (basically the short rib meat that has been filet, so no bones to deal with and some other cut of meat which I can't recall at the moment).  And they have everything you cam order from the lunch AYCE plus (....)\n\nFor one person, I think HP's AYCE setup is not really to my liking.  You basically order everything by the dish (same arrangement as Tofu House), and not like Wooche or Sura (you get a plate and load up on whatever suits your fancy). And it is hard to finish everything on a plate by plate basis as a lone AYCE diner, unless you have a voracious appetite like mine.

The waitresses can do all the cooking and you can concentrate on the eating.\n2) Very good exhaust system. No worries about coming out smelling like BBQ. Very helpful if you are here for lunch and have to go back to work for a few more hours.\n3) Reasonable price, food overall is good.\n4) The special metal pan used for BBQ is pretty cool, and food does not really stick to it.\n\nUndecided:\n1) Their Teriyaki Chicken does not taste like what you would think a Teriyaki Chicken to taste like (after it is cooked).  It is basically a spicy Korean interpretation, which is okay. I might like it more if it is called something else.\n\nMinuses:\n1) They were out of some items on their AYCE menu.\n2) 2 items are limited to 1 order.\n\nLocation: Very convenient for those that can get to the Chinatown area on Spring Mountain.

Within minutes we ordered the pork belly, spicy pork belly, kalbi and the boneless sirloin (I forget what it's called) all off the AYCE menu.\n\nThe waitress came back with our four different banchan, the sirloin and put kim chee, sprouts and pork belly on the grill.  From there it all went downhill...slowly.  \n\nWe devoured the pork belly, but the lady had turned the fire off so we kind of just sat there wondering what we should do.  Meanwhile, every time people came through the front door, it wouldn't close.  Which meant the frigid night air was blowing right on us and other tables seated near the front.  Without complaining, we kept standing up to close it.  You'd think that after about 20 times of doing this (along with the other table near us) some employee would have seen us and offered to fix it.  But you'd be wrong.  \n\nFinally, a nice waitress [the only nice one?] came by and we immediately bombarded her with requests: if she could somehow fix the door; please start the fire again; could we get more food, water and banchan; and we asked for steamed rice.  It took about 15 minutes before ANYONE came within earshot of our table.  Why on earth would it take 15 minutes to get water refilled, let alone more food?  This is a restaurant, right?  They serve food here, right?  Regardless, we were finally able to defrost and we finally had some food and water!  Woo hoo!  \n\nWarning: buzz kill coming.  About halfway through the sirloin, we started wondering when the rest of our food was coming.

Again, following Mr. Curtas's excellent advice, we order the \"Honey Pig\" package for 3 (total price: $59.99), which comes with a bottle of \"soju,\" a drink which the waitress explains is \"Korean vodka\".\n\nThe waitress brings our bottle, turns a tableside knob to heat up our panchan, and, in the time it takes us to pour a round of soju, she starts to pile on the goodness.\n\nWithin minutes, slabs of beef and pork begin to sizzle as piles of kim-chi and bean-sprouts simmer & steam. Is there a better aroma than that of grilled meats? Small bowls of pickled cucumbers & seaweed, mushrooms, and some kind of slaw are brought as appetizers as we soak in a fragrant cloud of browning awesomeness. The waitress reappears, this time with a pair of tongs in one hand and a pair of scissors in another, and, in mere moments (the time it takes for us to swig another round of soju), our panchan is covered in goodness.\n\nWe tuck in with gusto. And the flavors are incredible. In a single chopstickful, I manage to wedge a chunk of hot, carmelized pork with a strand of spicy, vinegary kim-chi, and the contrast of flavors makes my tastebuds quiver with delight. Then I try a chunk of barbecued beef coupled with an al-dente-but-sweet piece of onion, followed by a wad of hot bean-sprouts. Again, the flavors are staggeringly pleasurable. Once my eyes roll back into place so I can focus them again, I take another swig of soju and keep eating.\n\nBetween the 3 of us (not one of whom weighs less than 200 pounds), the panchan is nearly cleared of food when the waitress brings yet more bounty: a pile of octopus that she expertly slices and places at the top-center of the panchan, warning us that \"it's not ready yet!\"\n\nAt this point, I am swooning with such paroxysms of gastronomic delight that I forget to snap a picture of this last protein course. It, too, smells amazing as it fries. When the waitress nods to us that it is ready to eat, the 3 of us devour it like rabid dogs. The chewy octopus had been wonderfully marinated so that it is perfectly complemented by just the right amount of acidic, biting chili sauce.\n\nBut that isn't the end of it! When the waitress (for purposes of this narration, I have conflated 3 or 4 different employees into a single character) notices that we are done with our mains, she turns off the heat and piles a mixture of rice and veggies onto the panchan for a final course -- a little something to stave off the meat comas we are in danger of succumbing to.\n\nThe rice sizzles slowly, and I remember more advice from the sagely John Curtas, which I will now quote from his excellent website:\n\n\"If you're patient, the rice will attain that crispy, browned underside that the Spanish call soccarat (when it sticks to the paella pan). Tossed with whatever meat, vegetables or seafood are left on the pan, it becomes something like the ultimate fried rice.\"\n\nI cannot stress enough the importance of following the advice of professionals. We do, and are duly rewarded. When the bill comes, it's for $59.99 and tax, a paltry sum for a meal that stuffed 3 fully-grown men and included a small bottle of vodka.\n\nThen comes the surreal climax of the night. As we enjoy the last few bites of this last course of our meal, I turn around in my chair to survey the room. And who do I light upon? The one-and-only John Curtas HIMSELF, seated a couple of tables away, enjoying a meal with 2 guests.\n\nWe are awestruck, and, after settling up, as Don makes a quick pit-stop, Brother Juan & I approach Mr. Curtas and offer a thanks for the recommendation.

It wasn't the ideal situation. \n\nI was intimidated when I first came here because I read in different reviews that we may get ignored because we were not Korean. When we walked in they were very nice and attentive. They put a bunch of different items in front of us that you can use to enhance your meal.

The waitress cooked our meat (short Rib and Brisket )sprouts, and Kimchee for us. \n\nThey started us with some Seaweed soup which was a little salty for me . I tried mostly all of the items they put in front of me except for one thing I'm curious about. They looked like wet coffee beans I wanted to try them but didn't so I'll have to try it next time. The meat was really savory and delicious! I enjoyed eating it with steamed rice, the sprouts, and Kimchee. I also ordered some Korean fried rice which is a little different from Chinese fried rice. This fried rice had seaweed and it looked like pieces of romaine lettuce it was different but still good.

Honey Pig is an AYCE Korean buffet, BUT (and it's a BIG BUT!), it's really not all you can eat...they place a few limitations on the amount you can request on certain items of the AYCE menu.  It's funny how the waitress helps you cook your food at your table and regulates your intake like a micro-managing boss!

For an additional cost, ask them to make kimchee fried rice once you are finished with your meal.  The leftover kimchee on the grill is what they use to make your To Go fried rice!

The meat was nice and tender when grilled, and it didn't shrink which was a good thing considering I got a big size.\n\n- Spicy bugolgi - Hmmm, this I wouldn't go with.  It tasted like they just made it, and the spices are a little weird.  I think it's a little to spicy for my taste.

The marinade is quite delicious and it compliments the rice very well.\n\n- Pork Neck - Hmmm, I thought ordering it would be interesting but the piece we got looked like a slice of pork chops.

I think it tastes the same regardless of where you go.  \n\n- Sides - It came with some kind of anchovies and tofu, salad, spicy pickled cucumbers, and hot kimchi and bean sprouts.  I thought the idea of grilling the kimchi and bean sprouts were interesting, but unnecessary since I didn't even touch it.

Most of us are pretty accustomed to Korean Food but hadn't been to Honey Pig before.  Their grills were really neat because they were cone shaped so all the fat would be separated. We decided to do All You Can Eat for $20 so we can get a little taste of everything. \n\nAnd taste EVERYTHING we did. We went down the menu like a checklist. We had the pork belly first and unanimously agreed on how tasty and fresh it was. Each meat they brought out after that tasted just as good or better. You could tell just by looking at the color of the meat that it was fresh. I especially enjoyed how they grill the bean sprouts and kimchee. Most of the banchan (side dishes) were good but I missed others that I had at other Korean BBQs such as steamed egg and soup.\n\nService was wonderful. Our waiter took the time to answer any questions we had and explain what everything was. Even with a huge group of 12, he cooked everything to perfection and made sure we always had enough banchan and drinks. They serve a rice flavored iced tea for free.\n\nMy picky friend pretty much tried and loved everything except for the squid (which he claims to be allergic to) and that in itself speaks volumes.

But the name is so cute and it had generally good reviews on yelp.\nSo we went, had some overpriced $12 soju (retail $3) and everyone got all you can eat. The guy wouldn't let me start w kalbi and spicy pork - said no do the brisket because it cooks faster. That wasn't a suggestion he wouldn't let me start with what I wanted. They brought out the sides,like 4 things - more regular kim chee, radish, some kind of fermented fish and these cute little pancakes. The selection sucked I asked for cucumber kim chee she said we don't have that, soy sauce potatoes \"we don't have that\", more of the pancakes pls \"you only get one\" WTF! \nBrisket is done and they bring out another pile of kim chee and bean sprouts to cook.

HONEY PIG!\nI have such a love affair with this place.  I'm at Pho So 1 twice a week so I have to drive past it, casting longing gazes for cuts of various meats, Barley Tea (\"Chan\"), and the savory sauces.  \n\nThe first time I saw the place/heard the name I laughed so hard at the ridiculousness of an establishment called \"Honey Pig.\"  Nonsense, I declared!  (And how I've eaten my words...)\n\nHoney Pig is a Korean BBQ chain that features the grill in the center of the table that you cook various meats, rice, kimchi, and whatnot to your specs, dip in sauce, and enjoy.  They are 24 hours, with all you can eat for lunch and dinner.  I personally consider them the best Korean BBQ for what Vegas has to offer.\n\nNow I suppose if you're from Vegas or areas in cities where various scopes of nationalities and food cultures are everyday, like most of the locals here, going to Korean BBQ AYCE is just another function of the day, such as getting a burger or going to Panera.  I just love bringing people here who are very much meat and potatoes or my family who happens to be VERY Italian and VERY WTH-IS-THIS regarding anything that's not pasta and chicken and are casting a dubious eye to this establishment.  \n\nThis is such a great place to show off and be all, \"HAHA TOLD YOU SO\" because honestly, how can someone argue with you that they don't want to eat here or they're not into that kind of thing when the meat is cooking in front of you, all delicious and amazing?  It's introducing a different type of food without having to talk them into it.  Just get them to sit down and you're done.  (Okay, maybe they won't be all about the kimchi and whatnot but unless they're a vegetarian, they'll find something.)\n\nThis place also has a certain amount of quirky charm that I like.  The girls uniforms with their little bowtie and the rows of piggy banks on the walls added a sense of fun.  And major props to the waitresses, I might add, busting it all over the restaurant from table to table.  Imagine you had to cook some meat on a grill.  Imagine you had ten tables to simultaneously prepare and serve meat to?  Granted, the real-deal Koreans were showing most of us up, cooking and preparing it themselves, so they weren't quite the burden that most of us were, but those waitresses must leave there exhausted at the end of the day.  \n\nThe AYCE is stupendous.  STUPENDOUS I SAY.  It was just round after round of huge cuts of meat yet I was done by the seventh round, I couldn't do any more. This is a great place to come in a giant group and see who can keep going.  And the rice at the end, to cook it to the point where it gets a little stir-fried esque and is one of the best parts of the meal.\n\nThe one thing that made me VERY pleased was that the first three times I ate here was with two other Asians, one of which was a Korean (Olympian, actually..), and our service was kind of great.  I was -terrified- of what some others have suggested on here, that showing up by myself or with someone who wasn't Asian in my party, would I get the same level of treatment?  \n\nThankfully: YES, I did.

But just remember when you're paying for the bill and calculating how much tip you should leave.. \"I told you so!\" \n\nWhen I came in with my cousins 3 days ago, there were 4 Korean girls working the front.  We asked for a table and sat down, checking out the menus.. but as soon as we sat down and looked around, my 2 cousins and I all noticed that 3 of the 4 girls standing at the counter were whispering to each other and kept glancing over at our table They were laughing and staring, making it VERY obvious they were whispering some crap about us. I ended up making eye contact with them and one of the girls didn't even bother to look away. She stared at me for a few seconds and then turned her head to finish working.. but the whole night she didn't bother to come over to check up on us. This happened a few more times during the night. They would not stop whispering and laughing and then glancing over to us every time we asked for a refill, or some food item! It was horrible, we felt so disrespected. Coincidentally, the  restaurant got busy about 30 minutes later.. with tables that were majority groups of men coming to dine and drink beer.  There had to have been about 7 tables with groups of men, and we were the ONLY table there with 3 girls. The whole time we were there, only 1 girl had the decency to come over and check up on us without us calling for them, while all of them would constantly check back and forth to all of the tables with the men. I'm not trying to be judgmental, but I swear it was so obvious that they were trying to please the other people (for more tips probably). The whole experience was unprofessional, and downright disrespectful for us.\n\nOn top of bad service, as far as their menus.. it was ridiculously overpriced! Now, I am a really big food adventurer and work in a 5 star Japanese restaurant.. so when it comes to spending a lot of money on food, I'm not unfamiliar with. I don't mind as long as its good quality, or exotic. AND as far as Korean BBQ, I am a huge fan of therefore I have tried all Korean BBQ restaurants I know in Vegas. Honey Pig's all you can eat is $20 (which in the beginning, I thought was decent) .. BUT everything else was over $25 for a plate! Their single plate BBQ (just raw meat) started off at $25 for simple brisket.. Every other type of meat, including even pork belly was $25 and more!\n\nMy cousins and I ended up getting the all you can eat, which was $60 + tax for 3 people. The meat was alright nothing different from the other Korean restaurants..but the thing that bothered us the most was how the waitresses portioned our servings. We had each ordered different items on the all you can eat list.. and when we told her to bring out a plate of everything so we can try each.. SHE LOOKED AT US LIKE WE WERE CRAZY. I mean, wtf? We're paying $60 for all you can eat! In the end, she DIDN'T bring us all of the plates, only the first 4 things we asked for.. and on top of that, the portions got smaller and smaller as we ordered more. It was unbelievable. It got to the point where my cousin didn't even want to ask for more food because the girl had come back about 4 times already. They were being so cheap with their all you can eat. They assumed  that we were 3 girls, therefore we shouldn't have be getting the same amount as a table full of men. There was no rice either, so none of us got really full.\n\nOverall, I DO NOT recommend this place if you're looking for quality Korean BBQ. It has nothing special. Like Tofu Hut (there AYCE is only $14), or even Korean BBQ in the Chinatown plaza (which is more expensive than Tofu Hut).. it's the same type of meat and style of cooking.. \n\nThe service at  Honey Pig is absolutely disgusting. Even if you don't like AYCE, their combination dishes are ranged from $40 for 2 people and increase a good $30 after that for 3 and so on ... You're still spending an average of $25 there regardless.

They quickly sat us down and handed us a menu which had some outrageously expensive prices much different from the $19.99 AYCE that they mentioned on the phone. After asking a few questions about it they finally gave us the AYCE menu. We did not have a choice on what we wanted to choose first , which was very different from the other places I've been to. They brought out small portions of Pork Belly (which was probably the best thing I ate there I might add) and brisket. \n\n-The unique thing about this place is that they actually cook the meat for you, which would be cool if they actually payed attention to the customers and how hot the grill actually is. Often times, the tongs were too far for us to reach so we had no way of actually flipping the meat ourselves and had to wait until one of the waitresses walked by. Lets just say I got used to eating overcooked meat that night.\n\n -Every time my boyfriend and I wanted to order more meat, we felt really uncomfortable because the waitresses made it very obvious that they were unhappy about it. \n\nI'm not sure if I would come back here again for the AYCE.

Mr. Lee is so respected that even the Japanese members of our agency see him as a great role model for their community.\n\nI'm a Yakiniku guy. But, HONEY PIG is the only Korean BBQ that I would prefer over Yakiniku(for those of you who do not know, Yakiniku is the Japanese variation of Korean BBQ). Yakiniku restaurants are known for using very high quality meats, but the beef at HONEY PIG is much more tender and higher in quality than even the most expensive Yakiniku joints in San Diego or LA.\n\nThere are lots of really good choices here in LV for AYCE Korean BBQ, but they just can't compare to HONEY PIG. Sura is also a great choice, but it can't touch THE PIG.  Don't get me wrong, I love Sura and the service is really good but HONEY PIG just has much more superior quality meats and it's  always perfectly marinaded.

You can bring your Korean friends to the best Korean restaurant in the world and they will still give it 1-star.  Korean's always compare restaurants to their mother's cooking and if it doesn't taste like Mom's kalbi then it officially \"sucks\" to them. So if you are Korean, then maybe don't come here. If you are Japanese, Filipino, Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, etc then come on over.  \n\nSome yelpers are claiming that the staff won't treat you well unless you are Korean. That's just not true. Most of us are very visibly Japanese, and we get VIP treatment.  I don't know, maybe they just treat us good because we spend so much money.  I mean, if you are Asian-American and your household doesn't have investments and assets worth at least over 1.5 million, you probably should be pretty embarrassed to call yourself Asian.\n\nMr. Lee does a very good job with his restaurants.

My poor father, sister, and boyfriend had worked up a sweat all day long without water in the desert heat and decided to come to Honey Pig since it was the closest Korean restaurant.\n\nWhen we walked in, the place was busy but not packed. We were asked to pick a seat and was given the menu and iced water to start-- hallelujah. We finished the pitcher of water faster than you can say Mississippi and asked for another pitcher of water.

Whatever. I was able to figure out our total bill including tax on my phone before he was able to fix it in the system. \n2. After he fixed the bill and handed it back to me I noticed that the sales tax rate was at 8.15% which I am pretty sure that the current tax rate in Clark County, Nevada is at 8.10%.

When they are grilled, they are amazing.\n- Let the beef get a dark char on it, then let it sit in the sesame oil for a minute before eating it. \n- The pork belly is INCREDIBLE when you let it carmelize on both sides. It it wonderful with sesame oil on it as well. \n- At the end, after the chicken - request that the next round is bulgogi fried rice. Let the rice sit there until you think it's burning, then let it sit some more. The goal is to get the rice cooked onto the cooking surface. It will caramelize and create the most amazingly sticky sweet crispy goodness. You'll have to use the metal spoon and some elbow grease to scrap it from the surface. It's worth every little bit of effort. \n\nAt the end of your meal, they will bring you cantaloupe to start the digestive process. \n\nI hope you enjoy this as much as I did :)", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "i drove all the way across the dessert to have... korean bbq. ive had the honey pig in ktown/LA and this place was very very comparable, with the bonus of having NO WAIT!\n\nwhat i ate:\n- pork belly: you cant come to a place named after a pig and not have any pork. pork belly was oh so tasty\n- beef tongue: yum\n- galbi: very well marinated, and very very tender\n- fried rice: i know youre full, but trust me when i say, ORDER THIS. your stomach will say it's full, but you keep putting your spoon out for just one more bite. and then another bite. and then another. and then you look down at the grill and realize that its all gone! oh noes! oink oink!\n*TIP* we ordered meat a la carte, but if you get one of the combos, the fried rice comes out as part of the meal and you dont have to order this\n\npros:\n- no wait! im used to the LA branch where the wait can be atrocious (at least ~45 mins)\n- service was pretty good for an asian place. the ding dong bell on the table really helped\n- owner was so sweet. it was chuseok, or korean autumn festival so she gave us traditional sweet korean rice cakes for dessert\n\ncons: \n- small tables. the grill pan dominated the table leaving very little room for the banchan and other things to eat. but seriously this is such a trivial complaint.\n\nwould i come again? if i was in vegas and craving kbbq, sure", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "For starters I'd just like to say I was really optimistic about this place in the beginning, but I was pretty turned off by a handful of things. \n\nFirstly, they have about 4 beverage options.

The ambiance of the place is nice, each table set up with its own personal BBQ grill and it feels pretty cozy.  \n\nSince it was our first time there, the waitress recommended that we share a combo meal, which we proceeded to choose B set.  As we waited for the ingredients to come out, the waitress handed us a pitcher of what looked like tea.  Since we asked for water, we were pretty confused but we tried it anyway.  It definitely was not my cup of tea, excuse the pun.  To me, it tasted like cold red bean water, yuck.  After that, everything was great.  The waitress kept bringing out different foods for us to eat, the majority of which I had no idea what it was but I was feeling adventurous and tried everything.  Believing that my boyfriend and I were going to cook our own BBQ, I was again confused when the waitress started doing it for us.  I'm not sure if she did it cause that's how this place operated or if it was because we were the only ones in there and she was bored, but we had our own personal chef and it was great.  She cooked it perfectly and the food tasted amazing.  \n\nOverall, I say this is a great place to go on a date or with friends.

I had to actually ask for the all you can eat menu, as they only gave me the regular menu, and did not offer the other one.

I also did not like that you have to ask for rice, as they do not serve it with the meal.  On a smaller note, they also cook the kimchi and bean sprouts on the grill--probably just a taste thing, but I preferred those items cold.  The side dishes were fair, in my opinion.

There are several buffet stations to chose from. The first area is a selection of chilled raw or marinated beef, chicken, and shrimp. You choose what you want and then bring them back to your table which has a built-in grill. Sounds good so far, right? The other stations include a rice station, chilled veggies, sushi and Japanese selections, kimche, and other assorted Korean favorites.\n\nWhere do I start?\n\nThe buffet sections that are supposed to be chilled are only slightly cooler then room temperature and the foods that are supposed to be hot are tepid at best. Honestly, I am shocked that the health department hasn't shut them down. \n\nNow to the food. Okay, I know I just said that food wasn't kept at proper temperatures...and we should have looked at the buffet before being seated, but the people that I was with decided they wanted to give it a try. I admit to being a sheep...and without protest, I stayed.\n\nThe unknown meats were somewhat disgusting. OMG, they were so chewy and gristly I had to choke them down or pull bits out of my mouth. The marinated chicken had a weird coloration. Of course, like an idiot, I ate some. \n\nThe bottom line is that the meats were actually quite bad. The rice was cold, the pieces of stuff they called \"sushi\" were at room temperature, and the Korean specialties that they offered were not to my liking. That may be due to the fact that I'm unfamiliar with Korean food. Nobody went back for seconds...and this is an all-you-can-eat joint! That says a lot.\n\nTo boot, it's fairly spendy for lunch at $12.99. Not outrageous, but high considering the food quality. \n\nWhen we drove out of the parking lot we took odds (hey, we're in Vegas!) on whether or not we would get food poisoning. I figured there was a 30% chance I would get sick, but fortunately I was fine and nobody else in my party felt the least bit ill. A miracle. \n\nThis definitely ranks up there with one of the worst meal experiences I've ever had. Even if they fixed the hot/cold situation, I wouldn't go back.

The selection was comprehensive (16 vegetables and 1 bulgogi).  As Misti have stated in her review, you grab a reallllllly big bowl, fill it with as much or little rice as you want, top it off with the vegetables and beef that you want, and by the time you get back to your table the fried egg should be ready to top off your BBB creation.  When I was there, the choice of soup was seaweed soup (has a slight spicy kick to it) or miso soup.  I thoroughly enjoyed my meal here and will drop by to try other items on their menu on my days off.\n\nAnd the most important thing for BBB lovers, is that this is the only AYCE Bibimbap option in all of Las Vegas. And for just $9.70 (including tax) no less.\n\nAt night, I believe this to be a Korean bar hangout as their combo specials involve adult beverages like Korean Souju with other Korean foods.  At least that was my understanding, when I asked about the posted specials written in Korean.\n\nD\u00e9cor - 3.5/5\n\nValue - 3.5-4/5\n\nFood - 4/5  (based on the BBB)\n\nLocation - 5/5 (not too far from the Strip and pretty much in the middle of the stretch of Spring Mountain Rd that have the collection of Asian restaurants).\n\nParking - Usually is not a problem\n\nOverall - rounding up to a 4/5 Yelp stars.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 6, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "This place is potentially a 5-star for me but I will have to go back a few more times to know for sure.

The Mom was immediately impressed by it and the smart guy at the counter pointed out that you get the dumplings for free if your order was $20 or more.  Of course, that easily sold us and we added the Kalbi Plate ($12.95) to our lunch to get that order of dumplings!\n\nWe took a seat nearby and waited for our order.  The order of 10 dumplings were ready first, and they do usually go for $5.95.  It was piping hot and we loved the extra crispy texture.  It was filled with pork and noodles.

My girlfriend and I have a Korean friend that we admire a lot (a fellow Yelper). She has turned us on to Korean cuisine. This place is inside Greenland market, which is a Korean supermarket. When you enter Greenland market look to your right and you will see a food court similar to those at the mall.  The second booth from the left is Island Style. It says so on the menu board, but I did not see it for a while because I had sensory overload from all the Korean words. We walked through the food court and chose to stick with Island Style. The two guys working the counter were very friendly and answered all of my silly questions. I ordered the bibimbap in a hot pot, which cost $9.95. My girlfriend thought she ordered hot kimchi soup. After sitting down we looked at the receipt and realized that it was not ordered. We also ordered a Spam Musubi. The entire meal cost us $12.86. The seating is like food court at the mall. I first heard of bibimbap while reading Yelp reviews and have been very interested to try it. It comes in a marble-like bowl, I presume to retain the heat and continue cooking after arriving at the table. Similar concept to fajitas served on a hot cast iron skillet. It has beef (very small portion), cucumbers, pickled bean sprout, and a few other veggies served on a bed of rice. A raw egg is put in (will cook in the pot). A dark red sauce was served on the side. I thought it was hot sauce, but it was not. It was sweet instead. I put the sauce in and mixed it all up. It also came with a side bowl of chicken broth and green onion tips. There were two sides of kimchi. We ate the Spam Musubi first, which is a hot slice of Spam set on top of sticky rice with vinegar for flavoring and rolled in seaweed paper like a big, fat piece of sushi. It was definitely worth the $1.95. The bibimbap was pretty good too. The pot continued to cook the rice while we ate and provided a crunchy surprise at the end. I enjoyed the way the sweet sauce mingled with the other flavors. I wanted to try something else, but my girlfriend persuaded me to stop. She was right. The bibimbap, Spam Musubi, and complimentary sides left us satisfied.

So I headed up Spring Mountain to check out Pho Saigon on Rainbow.  I figured if they were not open I could at least visit the market next door.  Much to my surprise I saw Woonam Jung right there too and it was open.  Well, I had never had real Korean food before so I thought \"what the heck.\"  I may as well give it a try.

There was classic cabbage kimchi, cucumber kimchi, bean sprout salad, broccoli raab, and the big mystery side.  That was some sort of shredded or noodle looking dish.

Also they have all the other items like rib eye, marinated beef, pork belly, spicy pork, beef belly, squid, steamed egg, etc.  The only item that is not on the list, that places like Sura have, is shrimp.  This is not one of those establishments where you go and pick your meat, instead you order off a menu and they come to your table and cook the meat for you.  For the price of $25 for AYCE, it's on par with the other restaurants, but the galbi is what will have me coming back here instead of other places.  The banchan is a little limited, only three or four items....and I noticed because I always notice Asian biases...other tables with Korean speaking customers received \"extra\" banchan and maybe a little extra attention while they were there.  But overall, the customer service is still better than some of the other AYCE Korean places, since they did come and flip the meat and cut the pork belly and kalbi into smaller pieces for us.  They also serve an after dinner drink....a sweet cinnamon/ginger/dried persimmon punch with pine nuts...meant to aid in the digestion of the copious amounts of meat inhaled.  This place is owned by Mr. Lee of Lee's liquors....as was made obvious as he sat and enjoyed his dinner and a glass of wine in the corner....Mr. Lee is clearly a very successful businessman...and now he has another money making sensation on his hands.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 5, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I am not Korean and I sort of felt like an outsider here.

Sura has some serious competition now that Mr. Lee threw his hat into the AYCE KBBQ ring. \n\nFor a measly $26 at dinner, you can fill your three stomachs with all the Kalbi you want and your other three with bulgogi, chadolbaegi (thinly sliced beef brisket), samgyupsal (pork belly), dak (chicken) bulgogi , deh ji (pork) bulgogi plus the steamed egg and doenjang jjigae (soybean soup) traditionally served with a Korean BBQ meal.

S's table boasted some heavy eaters like Nelson Q. himself, Paolo D., and Jieun L., and finished off 5 rounds of food, my table that consisted of myself, Tony T., Bobby Y., Misti Y., Anthony M., and Ife A. were no slouches either.  In fact, although we may not have packed in as much total meat as our friendly neighbors just to the south, we polished off 9 rounds of food.  Yes, I was counting!  Never underestimate the eating prowess of Misti Y. and Bobby Y., who can be formidable eaters if it suits their fancy.  And Tony T., our masterful grill chef, who taught me that Jalapeno Peppers taste even better when cooked, just kept eating and eating amidst his cooking tasks.  Anthony M. ate his fair share, and took very few, if any, photos.  And, poor Ife A. kept getting blasted by dense smoke from the grill, which seemed intent on striking only her.\n\nMost food served was very tasty.  But the quality of the marinated Kalbi we were served in different rounds was inconsistent.  One batch was melt in your mouth delicious, but another was noticeably tough.  And at our table, service was mixed.  At first we could barely get our server's attention.  And, I had to ask for water 3 times and then after hearing \"Okay!\" wait another 10 minutes, and watch 2 new diners be brought water glasses by our very server before any water refill was delivered to deal with the Spicy Boneless Sliced Pork before me.  One of my dining companions remarked, \"Maybe she said, 'Nokay!\"  After this, we became more assertive in asking for replenishment of finished off items, and soon enough all was fine and we were eventually bombarded with water bottles and even a pitcher of aqua.  \n\nWe were not as adventurous as the hungry Hawaiian and his cohorts, so did not order any Beef Intestines.

This legendary Galbi DOES NOT exist anymore at Woonam Jung. Total bait and switch. Don't even think you're getting the same quality with the new (and stingy) AYCE plan. To make matters worse, the banchan they serve is below average, which is surprising because you'd think that it should be at least better than the stuff available at the Greenland Korean Market next door.

I'm accustomed to the spicy tofu soup versus the paste type they had here. Poo.  Overall, the amount of meat given was very decent and they changed our grill plate after each plate of meat.  No burnt pieces.  \n\nI have been to several places where there weren't many condiments to chose from.  This place had so many!

The restaurant is a pretty good size so I'm not too worried about making reservations unless you have a large party.\n\nThere's a lot of marinated meats (your typical ones like brisket and galbi) and a few non-marinated meats like pork belly and ribeye beef. They also have toppokki (spicy!) and steamed egg :0D. I'm sad that they don't have tripe :(.\n\nIt's definitely worth a try but maybe not too often due to the price.

This one has 3 (Bill, Water, Service), so you don't have to try to flag someone down when you need help. They come to you.\n       - Decor - Granite table tops, glass dividers, new and fancy grills. This is a way better date place.\n       - Price - They are a lot pricier than other places for Dinner ($17.99 Tofu Hut) and their Lunch cuts out a lot of the good meats. With that said, it does seem the quality of meat is higher here.\n       - Quality - The quality of meat is a lot higher than many of the other places. With the exception of how the beef brisket was marbled, the marbling on the other meats were really great.\n       - Grill - They use the circular grill like at Honey Pig. I think I prefer it over the rectangular ones since it lets the fatty meats you put on there first coat the grill. easier.\n       - Presentation of Meat - I like how they place all the meats on one plate for you instead of giving you multiple plates. It saves on the space and looks really nice (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/woonam-jung-las-vegas?select=mOHA27w4OjYu9GKKR_UejQ#mOHA27w4OjYu9GKKR_UejQ).\n       - Service - We came for lunch, but got the dinner AYCE. They put the meat on the grill for you when they bring the plate of meat and change the grill out for us without us asking when the marinated meats charred the grill.\n       - Tofu Hut Comparison - Tofu Hut is a lot cheaper, but it also looks worse and the marbling on the meat fluctuates between very good and terrible even on the same visit. I'd say it's a toss up between that place and this depending on how much you want to spend.\n**Price**\n       - $17.99 Lunch\n       - $27.99 Dinner\n**Ordered**\n       - Marinated Beef Short Ribs - They sere the beef with the bone still on the end. \n       - Rib Eye Beef - It came out as just as slab of unmarinated steak. Cooking it on the grill, it gets tough/dry quick and didn't have flavor. Maybe I'm not adding some sauce to it I should of.\n       - Beef Brisket - Not really marbled well, just had a lot of parts with fat. The parts without fat were a little dry.\n       - Beef Tongue - This was marbled perfectly. We got 3 helpings of this.\n       - Beef Belly - This tasted like a better marbled version of the beef brisket. I usually love beef brisket, but I think I\"ll get \n       - Pork Belly - I think I prefer the marinated version at Tofu Hut. The unmarinated one didn't have as much flavor.\n       - Side Dishes - I guess I'm used to Tofu Hut. They didn't have the same salad.

If my situation was to entertain a customer or a \"out of town\" guest with the best authentic korean food, my rating would be perhaps a two, only because of the \"five star\" places i have experienced in LA and Seoul. But understand that those are different situations.\nI was once traveling to Indiana with a Korean customer, and after days of great American food, he couldn't take it any longer and begged me for any kind of Korean \"Tang\" or soup. This was before days of cellular phones, so i looked in the white pages and found a Korean last name. I called them and explained my emergency, and was able to get a name of a place where we could remotely order anything that was even close to what my customer needed, (Korean Soup!)\nOnce there, the place wasn't even a Korean restaurant, and the lady was happy to see a couple of Koreans. She agreed to go off the menu (it was like a regular diner) and made us two Yook-Gae-Jang (). To describe this, it was not even close to our wildest expectations, as it was a modified american vegetable soup with tabasco and other hot spices. It fell short of our minimum expectations, as the dish itself was not in the definition of the name. But even so, we were thankful for the over priced vegetable soup with extra spices.\n20 or so years ago, Vegas was kind of like that experience in Indiana. You would be thankful to be able to eat Korean food, let alone Korean food that met expectations.\nNow, we have a substantial population of Koreans and even seem to have a Korean Supermarket.\nSo, back to my story. I came from LA area to attend a trade show for my wife. We brought our two teenage, American born girls to stay during the business trip. We ate the Buffets, the waffles, tacos, etc. but now needed some \"Soul recharging\" Korean Basics 101. I ordered some Bibimbap, Omrice (for the kids), Ttuk mandoo kuk, Sun tofu soup, and took it back to our hotel room. In one word, everyone was satisfied to a five star level. Was it the best Korean food ever?  For our situation and circumstance, it exceeded our needs. If i just arrived in Las Vegas from LA, we might say it just satisfied our needs. But after tonight's weary conditions, we are recharged!\nHungry and tired, I guess I could have driven around Spring Mt. Road a few more times, as in search for the Holy Grail of Korean foods, but with a mob of hungry and tired mouths in the back seat, I am glad I made the decision to order to go, and eat back in our room with a hotel movie.\nIt's the smiles and looks of satisfied stomachs that acknowledged me to be once again, the \"Man\" of our cave, and perhaps the possibility of running to be the leader of the Clan someday.\n\nAs for the movie we watched for $16.99 in our room ?

Four thin and flavorful slices of NY Strip within the soup add just the perfect amount of flavor, making this an excellent and subtle starter dish.\nFollowed up with the chef's special, SHRIMP RISOTTO ($12), plated beautifully with an entire, enormous shrimp (possibly actually a prawn?) surrounded by delicate risotto with mushrooms. Again, delicious and subtle- Chef Hong's classical training is very much evident in each dish.\nLastly we went for the CHICKEN WINGS ($8 for 6), very lightly breaded and topped in a light sauce that was almost a glaze. Plated beautifully, again, and accompanied by daikon, which served almost as a palate cleanser.\nHad to try dessert- Ryan recommended the special CREME BRULEE ($5), using a berry popular in Asia. I can't recall it's specific name but the taste was magical, each bite literally tasted different, with notes of sweet, then bitter, sour and a touch salty throughout the dining experience. Truly an adventurous dish.\n\nFollowing our dessert, Chef Hong came out to introduce himself and ask how his dishes were received- overwhelmingly positive experience! Owner made the effort to learn our names over our visit and escorted us out the door when we left.\nStellar service and phenomenal food. So glad we live so close, we will be making this a regular date night dining stop.

I haven't sampled much fusion Korean, but this first foray had some excellent flavors and the execution of each dish was spot on.\n\nMy personal favorite was the Pork Belly - it was tender, but the fat from the pork belly was not too powerful like in some variations. While the portion is quite small for a 13 dollar price point, the tastes are top notch. In my How Korean Is It scale (HKII), I'd say it was a 5/10. Bonus points for the little roasted veggies and the underlying mung bean crepe. This could be served at any high-end restaurant, as far as I'm concerned.\n\nThe Black Bean Noodle was another excellent tasting dish, though this one was more in line with its roots. I'd say it's like an HKII 8/10. I was slurping up all the sauce afterwards too. This one is a little heartier than some of the meat-only dishes.\n\nNext followed the Beef Tataki which had some very tender and moist slices of high quality meat. This one wasn't particularly memorable to me for some reason, but everything about it tasted great and the presentation was good too. HKII 6/10.\n\nThe Chicken Thigh was probably where I had the most to be picky about - Don't get me wrong, it's an excellent piece of chicken thigh, cooked to be moist and tender and the sauce is quite tasty. It just lacked some substance - maybe a breading or if it was served with a tiny bit of starch or veggies even. The sauce puts this at HKII 4/10.\n\nI enjoyed the Chicken Pottage quite a bit - it was the heartiest and most filling dish of the evening and had some very good flavor to it. Even for a porridge, it looked impressive to me visually. I don't remember the last time I had Samgyetang so I can't really judge on How Korean It Is... But my guess would have been like a 6/10. \n\nI would definitely tell a person going here not to expect traditional Korean food but a modern take on fusion. I'm looking forward to trying out some more of the flavors here as a lot of them were nuanced and complex, compared to your typical Korean dishes.\n\nWhile I felt my meal was very satisfying to my taste buds, I did feel like I wanted more - now given I was sharing with two other people we could have certainly tried some more but we decided to save it for the next trip. If there was one thing I could suggest for the menu, I'd like some more heartier options (almost like a filler!) Moko is a Tapas bar, and Tapas often means you always have the option of paella and such, so having like a shared bowl of \"modern\" bibimbap or something might be a fun twist on that idea.\n\nPrice adds up here, but not so much more than a typical tapas place with a very high quality. I felt the effort put into each dish, and the plating pictures on the Yelp are not dolled up at all.

That's left to Chef Hong who is a goooooodddddaaaamn culinary wizard!!  That guy is a total one man show coming in at 10am daily to prep all their amazing stuff for dinner when doors open at 5pm.    \n\nJust discussing the effort and detail Hong goes into preparing plates like the delectable beef short rib (butchering the beef himself, select bones to cook with to enhance the flavor, 3+ hours of cooking etc) was inspiring.  A well presented dish, the beefy fattiness of the short rib accompanied by crispy garlic, gratin and amazing sauce was heavenly.    Christina Perri's \"A Thousand Years\" was playing while I savored it all and it seemed very fitting.  \n\nIt's not often that an Asian restaurant includes a spoon for their table setting but Ryan is smart enough to know the sauce for not only the short rib but others like their \"Black Bean Noodle\" will/need/must be scooped up out of the bowl.  It sure looks a lot more elegant than sticking my face into it.  Genius!   \n\nThey offer Berkshire pork belly cooked for either 10 or 30(!!!) hours.  Even though the 10 hour belly is tenderer, how could I pass up 20 more hours of cooking for $1 more?  It was like nothing I'd ever had before.  The soybean paste marinade with the kimchi crepe and their homemade black raspberry marinated salt (who does that???) was exceptional. \n\nThe grilled then chilled eggplant salad with micro greens and tomato was refreshing and flavorful.  We also got an order of the fried soy chicken wings which was like modern soul food with the unique breading and honey glaze.

We were served house smoked yellowtail, house smoked salmon, and Korean noodles on a bed of kimchi broth jelly (some spicy and part not) with seared beef.  This was absolutely superb!  The sauces on the two smoked fish micro greens and the fish were really very tasty.\n  \nFor the second course, we got an eggplant salad with grilled eggplant, grilled shishito pepper, micro greens, a cherub tomato and Moko dressing.  Very refreshing with wonderful flavors.\n\nOur third course was spicy chicken thigh stuffed with kimchi and sweet potato with a sweet and spicy sauce.  I'm running out of adjectives to describe the fantastic flavors in this dish.\n\nThe fourth course was 10 hour braised Berkshire pork belly.

We'll just have to make an event out of those two categories the next time we come then! \n\nIt was a privilege to taste each of these plates:\n\nBulgogi Beef Tacos $9 - 3 tenderloin bulgogi tacos, pear, date sauce, soy sauce, mustard aioli, lime aioli all in a thin crispy shell - The bulgogi was so freaking tender and buttery! Each little morsel melted on my tongue. I loved the super thin, delicate and crispy shell they were in. I'm a sauce junkie so the 3 dots of sauce were not enough for me! I'll have to make sure to request more of their delicious sauces the next time I come. \n\n10 hour Braised Berkshire Pork Belly $12 - soy sauce marinated pork belly, crisp sweet potato, silky skinned and sweet cherub tomato, Kimchi crepe, black raspberry marinated sea salt - This pork was exceptionally prepared and all of the components of the dish shined. The pork was extra tender and delicate. It was seasoned expertly! Make sure to take a bite of the pork with a bite of the juicy, smooth skinned cherub tomato - that's the perfect bite! \n\nBeef Short Rib $14 - braised marinated prime short rib, crispy garlic, luscious gratin, demi-glace - Is this heaven? Explosive flavor! The short rib was so incredibly meaty, rich, buttery, and melt in your mouth good. The crispy garlic chips added incredible pops of texture and surprising flavor. I loved it. The creamy potato gratin was super luscious and addicting - it was the best choice to pair with the short rib. This was one of my top dishes of the night! \n\nBean Sauce Noodle $7 - egg white noodle, black bean sauce, pork, onion, carrot, zucchini, green onion\npoached egg - Oooh you fancy, jjajangmyun! The noodles were cooked perfect and al dente, the sauce was loaded up on flavor, oh man and the poached egg, you know it, silky luscious egg porn! This is the best gourmet black bean noodles I have ever had. \n\nHot Spicy Beef Soup $7 - beef brisket, mung bean sprouts, carrot, onion, green onion, spicy wholesome beef broth - Warmth for the soul. The brisket was crazy tender. The broth was very wholesome and comforting. It reminded me of eating in my best friends grandmother's Korean kitchen.\n\nEggplant Salad $7 - grilled eggplant, cherub tomato, grilled Shishito pepper, micro green, Moko dressing - This cold dish was very light, delicate, and refreshing! The grilled eggplant was grilled perfectly and tender, but very smooth and buttery when you bit into it. I also loved the delicate micro greens, they added pops of beautiful peppery notes. \n\nShrimp Risotto $13 - sake-steamed shrimp, shiitake mushroom, mushroom risotto - Wow!!! What an epic finale to our meal! Chef Hong brought out all of his tricks on this dish. He used every single part of the shrimp and coaxed so much flavor out of the sweet juicy shrimp head. He even surprised us with delicious shrimp eggs on our plate! What a treat! You could really taste the deep flavor of the sweet ocean in the risotto. Also, the risotto was extremely creamy and seasoned with precision. The best part was the shrimp was steamed to perfection! I'm in love.\n\nIncredible food, great conversation, and wonderful company!

I live around Henderson and was craving some good quick and cheap food. I stumbled upon this as I saw a Cuban restaurant that seemed like it looked pretty good, I instead saw this big huge Korean symbol and looked at it and went here instead of the Cuban restaurant. It was like any typical fast food teriyaki joint. The tables are sparse and the decor is lame. I didn't expect too much. I sat down and ordered their combination platter which included kalbi, chicken, fried pork, bulgogi, dumplings and rice. The side dishes were, of course, complimentary with the meal like any traditional Korean restaurant. The kimchee was good but I had better. Their food was decent and not amazing by any means but for a quick Korean meal and for a good price I would recommend trying it because it is decent for the price. I didn't have to travel to Chinatown to get it either.

It's wonderful, and is definitely good for two people, which is good because it costs $9.95!  \n\nTheir banchan is also pretty good, if not amazingly spectacular.

It is Korean food, but I get the feeling that it has been adjusted towards the American palette.  I'm no Korean expert, so I can't judge on authenticity, but I am very familiar with my tongue.  So I can at least tell you how the food tastes.\n\nLocation:  Jun's is located in a strip mall that shares a parking lot with Regal Cinemas north on the 215 on Eastern if I am not mistaken.  This area seems to have taken a turn towards the Asian as of late.  And I am not disappointed about it.  The Market just north along the strip mall has all kinds of Asian goodies and some pretty decent Filipino food.  Then there's the ever popular Lemongrass Caf\u00e9.  I'm loving it.\n\nExterior:  Nothing special.  It is just a sign, glass store front, and a door.  Look for the red, white, and blue sign.  You can't miss it.\n\nInterior:  Again, nothing special here.  There are a couple of standard tables and chairs.  No booths.  The wall has some pictures of writing and what not.  You can place your order at the counter for takeout or have a seat and get service.  \n\nService:  Two options on this one.  Order at the counter or at your table.  Eat in or take out.  There are two servers that I always see there.  One is the younger, friendlier, but not so talkative women.  Then there is the older, not so friendly, less talkative, women.  I don't go there for the service anyway.  They get my drinks, my order, and my food.  I could ask for nothing more.\n\nFood:  You'll always receive a bunch of side dishes that go with your meal at most if not all Korean places.  I love the Kimchi, Kimchi cucumber (I think it's cucumber), and everything else except the potatoes or whatever.  I am just not a fan of potatoes.  I'm sure they taste good to someone, just not me.\n\nMy normal meal is the Jun's special.  I love everything that comes on this plate.  The dipping sauce is tasty for the man du.  The meats are flavorful.  I even like the taste of the salad.  My girl friend gets the Kimchi soup or something.  She seems to love it.  We will often make special trips here just so she can get a bowl of it.  I say special because it is not exactly a short trip for us to get here.\n\nOne thing that I did not enjoy from Jun's was the seafood pan cake.  I just didn't like it.  It wasn't my thing.  Now I'm not going to pass judgment on it since I think it's just a personal taste thing and I don't know what good Korean pancake is supposed to taste like.  I'm just throwing it out there.\n\nSummary:  So over all, this has always been a good meal at a good price for me and my girlfriend.  It takes me back to Hawaii and Yummy Korean BBQ in the Prince Kuhio Plaza.  I think that is why we always come back to this spot.  It's like a taste of home.

(Next time, I will!)  I recall eating at Jun's Korean Restaurant a year ago and the bulgogi and spicy squid were decent.  Since my mom wanted to eat some spicy squid too but didn't want to dine out, I decided to order \"Take Out\" -- which was a HUGE mistake!  So, I ordered bulgogi for my son, spicy squid for mom and spicy soft tofu soup with beef for moi.  \n\nWhen I ordered over the phone, the lady never took my name.  I thought that was odd so I said, \"Don't you need my name?\"  She said, \"That's ok. We have your phone number\" -- Caller ID, I suppose that's what she meant.  When I got there, there was only 1 customer in the store.   I went up to the counter and said I have a \"to go order.\"  I literally repeated my whole order to her since she had a blank look on her face.  Suddenly, the light bulb went off and she reached out to two bags and gave me the total amount to pay...$30+.  Since the place was pretty dead and there were only one other togo bag, I made the mistake of NOT DOUBLE CHECKING my order, tipped her a couple of bucks and left.  \n\nWhen I got to Mom's, you can only imagine how baffled I was to find \"Spicy pork saute with kimchee and tofu\".  Huh?!  Where's the squid?!  I was pissed 'cause I was so looking forward to that for Mom so I made a phone call to Jun's.  The same lady answered the phone and she basically argued with me that I ordered the kimchee pork and she knows nothing about the squid. Wow!  She didn't even apologize or try to make amends -- and I knew I was wasting my time so I just hung up.  Mom was disappointed but we gave the \"new\" dish a try since we were hungry.  If you like pork and kimchee, I guess you'll like the dish.  We just prefer our kimchee as a \"side\" dish -- not an entree, thank you very much.  \n\nSad to say, the soup was horrible!  It was bland... it tasted like kim chee water ... not kidding!  The tofu was the only thing that was edible.  The menu said \"soft tofu with beef and vegetable\" ... um,... \"Where's the Beef?!\"  The better description would be: \"soft tofu with a strand of beef and kim chee and we just pour water over the kim chee and call it soup\".  To make the night worse, after my 3rd bite, I looked closer and WTF?!!  Am I seeing a strand of hair?!  (YEP!  It sure is!  GROSS!!!!!!)  I was no longer hungry and decided that I'll boycott this place!    \n\nNeedless to say, Mom and I were sadly disappointed by Jun's.  The One Star given is because my son ate the bulgogi.  I asked him if he enjoyed the dish and he said, \"There's no hair in mine.  It's definitely better than yours and grandma's!\"  Haha!  He's a funny kid!\n\nI guess there'll be NO \"next time\" here.

Great for takeout or dine in.\n\nStone Pot Bi Bim Bop (Dol Sot-please don't kill me if I misspelled it) for $9.95- Now this dish can only be enjoyed through dine in because of the stone pot it comes in.  There's a ton of shredded veggies, beef, egg and rice.  When it comes to the table, I wait for five minutes as the sizzling pot crisps up the rice, then I got to town!  I start by mixing everything together, crack the yolk and let the egg cook more on the pot.  I finish the mixed bowl with sriracha and soy sauce.  I can't get enough of this and will keep coming back just because of this dish alone!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!\n\nThe place is super small.  I find myself playing a guessing game whether or not we'll have a table open for us when we visit.  I think because of the location, it's super convenient for me and the wait time isn't very long.  \n\nBeing from Hawaii, I feel this place really attracts a lot Hawaiian transplants.

Ice cream on warm days, hearty stews in the dead of winter, hot dogs on the 4th of July and hot bubbling soup in the cool evenings.

If you're unfamiliar with Soon Tofu, to be warned, it's all about the drama, the taste and the satisfaction that not many soups can bring. Essentially its spicy Korean soft tofu soup, though could also be considered a stew since its so hearty and rib sticking. \n\nAfter nosing around a bit Ive found that not only do we lack the ethnic eateries like those found in LA, but also lack a dedicated Soon Tofu establishments. That is until I heard about Chodang Tofu and B.B.Q..\n\nLocated in an extremely plain and unassuming building you'll be completely surprised when you walk in. Gorgeous hardwood floors and wood work through out with a friendly staff that immediately helps you to feel welcome and relaxed. Chodang offers your usual suspects of Korean B.B.Q., but has an arsenal of cold noodle salads and of course Soon Tofu. \n\nAs soon as your order is placed they bring out whats called banchan which are several different side dishes in varying tastes and interest. Bean sprouts drizzled with sesame seed oil, kimchi, pickled sea weed and sometimes odd items like potato salad, or in our case a apple and cucumber Waldforf type salad. \n\nNow there is no need for this but we started with one of the noodles salads, #63, Chik Bibim Nyung-Myun ($9.95). So cool and refreshing this would be the perfect summer evening dish. Shredded cabbage mixed with long stretchy black arrowroot noodles all layered in a slightly spicy and pungent dressing. The arrowroot noodles are like those you've never tried before, Id lovingly call them edible rubber bands, they have plenty of pull spring and snap. \n\nThe Soon Tofu comes in 11 different variations ranging from seafood to fish roe as well as pork, beef and dumpling. With such an interesting range of set ups, it's simply about what you're in the mood for. On this visit #9 was calling ($9.25), a spicy red broth, with garlic, chili, silken tofu with a handful of perfectly cooked vegetable dumplings. When they bring out your Soon Tofu, this is where the drama starts, its wheeled on a stainless steel cart and when you see the soup you'll know why. Its served in an earthenware pot that's been heated in the oven and is blazing hot, its literally boiling. Then the server cracks a raw egg into the boiling soup which cooks amongst the scalding broth. What drama, what showmanship, how often can you say you had dinner and a show? Also with the show comes a bowl steamed rice. Korean rice is generally wetter then those found elsewhere which only adds to the sticky texture. Since each diner get their own bowl of rice, you simply spoon small amounts of tofu soup onto the rice and eat away.\n\nNo matter what the time of the year, know that Chodang Tofu can satisfy your inner cravings.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 9, "cool": 7}}, {"text": "Chodang GOOD!!

You do not get to choose, they come with the meal so don't review the place and complain about not having a choice.  They give you 6 and they will fill them up if you need more.  They are very fresh too.\n\nIf you enjoy the first meal and want to go back I suggest always ordering one new item and one you know is good.  That way you can experiment but not ruin the experience with 2 new dishes you may not enjoy.  There are a few soup-type dishes I really enjoy as well as a dumpling dish.  The staff is friendly, attentive and if they aren't there is a button at the table to summon them!  \n\nI see what I assume are Koreans there all the time and we are often the only ones that aren't.  We are kind of regulars and they know of us as the ones who love the seaweed.  By seaweed I mean the side that is wet and in a mild vinegar-y liquid.  I order extra when I get take-out because it is so yummy.  Sometimes they make a sesame flavored seaweed for the side that isn't as tasty.\n\nEither way, I have been here no less than 30 times and I enjoy myself every time.  I leave satisfied, stuffed, and with a healthy portion of leftovers.  And for how much?  Usually in the $20-30 range for 2 meals, 2 iced teas, and the included sides.  \n\nFrom the location and the outside it isn't anything special.

Decided to try this place out since it had the best Yelp ratings.  In the few months that I have been in the area, I have learned that Phoenix generally does not have very good Asian food, especially when compared to California or Las Vegas even.  With the lowered expectation in mind, this place wasn't half bad, but obviously not the best in the world.\n\nThe interior decoration of this restaurant was nice.  Very clean and traditional to a typical Korean shop.  Don't let the exterior, and random location, psych you out.  It'll feel much more homey once you step foot inside their facility.\n\nThe service was great as long as the place doesn't get too busy.  We got there a little early and the waiters were great to us in the beginning, but as soon as the tables started filling up, they stopped checking in on us so it took a little longer than we would have liked to get our waters refilled and to pay for the meal.  If you time your trips right, this shouldn't really be a problem at all.\n\nThe food was good enough to satisfy a craving, but I definitely miss Korean food from home.  The dishes here seem kind of generic.  It felt as if they just cut up some ingredients and threw it in pre-packaged store-bought seasoning and called it a day.  Definitely did not feel like a meal that the chef poured his/her heart into preparing for the guests.  As such, you would expect the pricing to be a little more reasonable than what they're charging.  $16 for so-so bubulgi.. come on!  I do give them props for the individualized clay pot rice bowls though.  Not too many places serve white rice that way, and I love fresh crunchy rice! :-D\n\nIn conclusion, would try this place again some day, but probably after I try some other places for comparison's sake.

By the time we left however, every table was taken.\n\nWe were two of the only 3 Caucasians in the restaurant, which is usually a good sign. We were seated quickly, and sat for a while. We finally received menus, but no one took our drink orders.\n\nCompanion ordered Dol Sot Bibim Bap ($10.50). This is a dish that is served in a very hot stone bowl. It has assorted veggies over rice along with pieces of beef. A squeeze bottle of red pepper paste is served on the side for you to mix in as you like it. One of the highlights of Bibim Bap is the rice that gets caramelized by it's contact with the hot bowl. Companion pronounced the dish up to her standards and meeting all her expectations. Unfortunately, no on ever asked companion if she wanted anything to drink with her meal. She finally stopped a waitress and asked for a glass of water.\n\nI ordered the Dak Bulgogi ($13.95) which is marinated pieces of (usually) dark meat chicken, sauteed in a sauce and served over slivered onions. The portion size was big enough for any eater, but I felt the sauce was a bit on the sweet side. Having eaten eaten this dish many times in various places, I was pretty sure that it should not have been as sweet as it was. I too, had to stop a waitress to ask for a soft drink. Another problem which I had with my dish is that part of a chore girl scrubbing pad was mixed in with my food! When I brought it to the attention of one of the waitresses, she immediately took it to the kitchen and offered to replace my dish. \n\nOn the positive side, the Banchan (side dishes) were excellent, especially the nori seasoned with salt, and the bean sprouts marinated in sesame. Perhaps the most unusual was the ultra thin sliced apple with cucumber and onion mixed with what seemed to be mayonnaise. Not something I've eaten before, but not bad either. Their Kimchi was very good, and thankfully had been cut into smaller sized pieces which many placed fail to do. \n\nOther dishes available include Bulgogi (Korean BBQ Beef - $14.95), Assorted Tofu Soups ($9.75) and Jap-Chae (Rice noodles with Beef and Rice ($14.95).

The nice thing about Chodang, it follows the Korean meal practice of setting out a number of small savory dishes, often with a mix of pickled vegies, and then bringing out the main course, which in this case was a bubbling hot bowl of soup, which the wait person will happily crack a raw egg into, which I recommend, and a side of rice. \n\nI ordered the soup a four on a  four out of five scale as my one time having truly Thai hot Thai food has made me wary of going for the top of the scale the first time in a restaurant. In  this case, if you like spicy, for four a 5 out of 5 level as the 4 out of 5 didn't seem all that spicey. However, I did love the tofu in the soup, they seemed to use a soft tofu which sort of breaks off in ragged chunks and was wonderful in the soup which was thick with kim-chee and had a number of thin slices of beef included. \n\nI do hope to come back again and follow the advice of Lester C (excellent reviewer of all things Asian, he has never steered my wrong so a shout out to my fellow elite Yelper) and try the Korean BBQ. I saw a plate of Korean short rips go by and they ,looked, as they say in Hawaii, Ono! It is a bit out of the way from where I live but only a few miles from the United Blood bank in Chandler so go do some good, give some blood and then reward yourself with a visit to this lovely Korean restaurant.\n\nP.S. - only weird thing, they serve the hot tea, which is more like warm team, in a large, plastic water glass, blah. Spif it up a bit Chodang and provide a teapot and a small cup for green tea. It won't cost much and adds to the experience.:-)", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "Korean short ribs, unbelievable tofu soups.

The potato side/small dish was my favorite. I enjoyed the seafood sundubu (tofu soup) I ordered but it wasn't quite as flavorful as some other sundubu I've tried elsewhere; it might've been because I ordered the \"Light\" spicy level.

Dak bulgogi (BBQ chicken) and galbi (short ribs) are also great options or additions to enjoy, and are also served the same way. You will be asked how spicy you like it too. If in a group, you might as well try the kimchi beef tofu soup served in a stone pot. Say yes to the egg in it. Let it sit and sizzle for a few minutes prior to eating. Eat this with rice. Rice is served in a mini silver looking bowl with a lid.

Between the fact that this place is on the list for Dividend Miles dining (US Airways miles) and mostly positive reviews here, I figured we'd get some tasty food.\n\nNow, let me begin by saying the first (and only, until tonight) Korean BBQ place I ate at was (goes to dig up the name of the place) Shilla Restaurant near Denny Park (apparently there are a few different restaurants with the same name). I'm pretty sure we got the bulgogi (marinated beef) and the chicken (marinated, too). The side dishes were all very good, seemed fresh and well prepared. Overall, a good place that we plan to return to sometime in the vaguely near future.\n\nSo, back to Phoenix, and Korean BBQ.\n\nWe get there, and maybe about a quarter of the tables are occupied. The decor is somewhat lacking, but nothing bad. One thing I did notice, that seemed a little odd, was a cleaning cart was just kind of sitting there in the middle of the dining room floor.  But hey, I'd just walked in, who knows what was going on before I got there.\n\nAfter a few minutes, we were seated. After only a short time, we were asked for our drink orders. My husband ordered a Coke, and I got hot tea and water. My hot tea came in the same kind of glass tumbler as my water did. Strange. As well as the odd presentation, it really wasn't very good tea.\n\nAfter a little time, we placed our order for the same beef and chicken dishes we'd had in Seattle. Seemed like a safe option. Shortly after, the side dishes came out, as well as some lightly dressed romaine salad and three large romaine leaves for \"wraps\". After setting these on the table, the waitress lit the grill and left it to warm. Before leaving, the waitress dumped a small dish of sliced raw garlic and jalepeno on the heating grill.  \n\nAbout five minutes later, our raw meat arrives. And this is where I start to get uncomfortable. You see, some years ago, I had to take a food safety class. I know all about cross-contamination, how it's bad juju, and what you need to do to avoid it. I'm guessing at least our waitress ... well, let's say she's never been close to a food safety class. Not even in the same city. Anyway, I digress. So, with a pair of tongs, she places two large pieces of thinly sliced chicken breast on the grill, which takes up half of the grill. Then she takes the -same- raw-chicken-goo-covered tongs and picks up the pieces of barely cooked garlic and jalepeno off the grill and puts them back into the same small dish they began in (ostensibly ready to eat). And _then_ she puts the beef on the grill with the same tongs. She basically dumps the contents of the beef plate (beef and raw sliced onion, same as the chicken).  \n\nAt this point, the entire grill is covered in a thick layer of meat. So much so, in fact, that the grill top has cooled down so much that nothing's really cooking. Just stewing in its own juices, which to me, isn't really bbq.  It's, well, stewing. She sets down the gooey tongs next to a pair of scissors and leaves.  \n\nA few minutes pass, and I take up the tongs (eew) and turn over the chicken. I take a look at the beef, but it's still a damp mess with no room to spread out on the grill. The waitress comes over, physically takes the tongs from me and starts messing with the meat herself.  Okaaay. Then she takes the scissors and starts cutting the meat up. The still raw chicken meat. Cuts the large pieces into smaller bite size pieces and leaves it to cook on the grill. Then, and I really shouldn't be surprised by this at this point, she picks up the beef with the tongs and slices a few pieces of it into smaller pieces with the _same_ scissors what just snipped up the half-raw chicken. A few more times pass where I go to flip the meat, and she comes over and takes the tongs away from me, and does it herself.  And some more meat snippage.\n\nFinally, we get to eat. It's not bad, but really not very good. None of it, sadly. It's not -bad-, but definitely nothing I'd repeat. Not once during our meal did anyone come by to see if we were doing okay, ask us if we needed anything, refill drinks or anything.  \n\nOh well. On the plus side, we got to try a new restaurant that wasn't completely horrible. On the downside, I'm now at home with an upset stomach and preoccupied with cross-contamination nightmares.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 3, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "The K BBQ here I've found to be quite tasty but the service has been pretty hit-or-miss.

Some places will bring a portable gas grill  to your table, this place has the grills built into the tables ( learned this from my server).

It's a thin sliced marinated beef rib - in my opinion just short of heaven. Your meal comes with a variety of vegetable side dishes served in small bowls for all to share. I had to ask what some of them were as I couldn't tell the difference between zucchini and cucumber, as well as some that were made from turnip (real good even though I'd have thought I wouldn't like it) My favorite was the spinach (again, who knew?), but they vary from day to day - just be aware of the variety. They have romaine lettuce leaves served with to use as a wrap, but I prefer just to dig into the meat and sides separately.\n\nI had a Korean beer (Hite?) and it was tasty.

They say that the meat portions serve 1.5 ppl.  So you're party of 4 will most likely need atleast 3 entrees to fill everyone up.  And they're right, the portions are a little small for the price.  So you might need to go 1 meat entree per person if you're a big eater.  However the food is very good.  We shared 3 entrees per grill, the kalbi, bulgogi and the chicken.  Only the chicken entree was lacking in flavor, everything else was very very good and perfectly marinated.  As for the sides, i know they change from time to time so its hard to rate them, but they were good.

The last meat dish we ordered marinated chicken, Dalk Gui. We started with an order of the potstickers and they serve this killer lightly dressed salad with a touch of white vinegar, sesame oil and salt and pepper. In typical Korean BBQ, the bring out an array of small side dishes to complement your BBQ. Some are spicy (different types of kimchee), some are salty, some are hot (last night, one dish they had was this awesome tofu that had to have been cooked on the flat top) served with this good sauce, boiled eggs in soy sauce and a sesame sprout salad. This is one of my favorite parts of the experience, you get all these cool little side dishes to eat with your rice and BBQ. On to my favorite reason to come to Korean BBQ. There's a grill in the middle of your table and a hood above your table. They bring out your meat already marinated, and you just grill it up as you like it and as you're hungry.

Your kimchi jeon was crunchy and flavourful, with little grease, although I would have preferred a wee dipping sauce to go with it, it did stand on its own. Dolsot didn't give me my craven crunchy bits and as the sauces were already added I didn't get to make choice on the level of spice, but it was good and full of vegetables. \n\nIn my limited experience, Korean restaurants present you with some wee amuse bouche type things - here was fried anchovies, marinaded courgettes, KIM CHEE (take that Shilla and your charging to have that on top!), and some spiced aubergine. You would be perfect if that honeyed potato was included, but I pick, I pick. That, and the potato soup to start were tasty and the price at the end was incredibly reasonable. \n\nService was a little slow to start, but picked up quite rapidly after, with us barely finishing the kimchi jeon before beef bulgogi and my bibimbap appeared.

Mr. Kim will greet you at the door and show you to a wee seat (or large table of 12 as we were). Proferring appetisers on kitsch china plates with warnings of \"Don't break these! They're expensive!\" (in the most adorable, tongue-in-cheek way possible), with beautiful hand-sewn chop stick holders, mismatched china (expensive) croquery and doily table cloths, and classical music in the background, with the sound of sizzling and delightful smells drifting from the nearby kitchen it's a dining experience like no other I've had in Edinburgh.\n\nAs to the food itself? Oh my, yes please. This was my first taste of Korean food and one I thoroughly enjoyed. Mr. Kim explained to us each dish, and as Ben mentions in his review, there are two menus to browse. One with a written description of each dish, and a step-by-step photo album of each dish so you can see all the ingredients before, during and the finished product. As someone who likes to cook, and frequently asks exactly what is in dishes out of curiosity, I loved this!\n\nWe shared a range of all the appetisers so I think it's safe to say I've tried them all? The rice cake in the hot pepper spicy sauce was interesting, unusual texture that I really enjoyed, and of course the spicy red pepper sauce was perfect for my spice-fiend tastebuds. The other pancakes were nice, although not what I'd normally order. The egg one was like an omlette, and the fish one in potato like a giant fritter. But quality-wise, very fresh.\n\nFor mains. BIMBIMBAP TIME!! I had the Bimbimbap (who knew?) but rather than with the traditional Scottish beef mince, I requested pork and prawns. Not a problem. And no egg. Also not a problem. As all the other reviewers have said, the food is just wonderful. So fresh, it came presented in a steaming, sizzling hot pot all the ingredients laid out neatly, and Mr Kim showed us how to stir it all in together. I LOVE the hot red pepper sauce. Would have had more if I could. It was a hefty portion too and greedy-gannit that I am, I finished it all. Every last piece of rice.\n\nThere's only one dessert on the menu, rice cakes, ours was flavoured with chocolate. The texture is more like turkish delight. It was fine, although after all the starters, complimentary soup and sides (that come with every main) and my huge Bimbimbap, I was more than full.\n\nWhat else can I say about Kim's, Mrs Kim herself, Mr. Kim and their son who served us? Wonderful family, wonderful family-run restaurant, delicious food, service with not only a smile but a story, humour and dare I say pizzazz? (That word, like Bimbimbap, is underused I'd say).\n\nOh, it turns out I'm not such a huge fan of kimchi (pickled cabbage). But that's personal taste. The little plates of food for the sides were delightful. And I love that they also unashamedly advertise one dish as made with 'hotdog pork and spam'.

Mr Kim does the rounds, looking after his guests with a personal touch.

Same with the Jeon starters and the Jjigae mains. I know this is a small family business but would it hurt to put a few specials on each week to broaden our experience of Korean cuisine?\n\nThe other niggle for me are the prices.

The bolgogi had a good sauce, but the meat had an unpleasant texture.  It either was sitting in the marinade for too long or the added too much meat tenderizer. Whatever it was, it left the meat rather mushy and unappetizing. The other problem was, the kitchen made the bolgogi and I speculate that they did not heat the pan hot enough.  Rather than it coming out a charred/caramel color it came out with no char and kind of a gray color.  For $40, I don't expect a fantastic meal, but I do expect a good one and can't say we got that her.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I would say Red Kimchi deserves a 3 maybe 3.5 rating based on my experience. I was looking for somewhere to take my fiance out for his birthday and stumbled upon this Korean restaurant on Yelp. I called and made a reservation for a table with the tabletop grill. When we got there we found that he had given our table away, although he apologized I was still annoyed and we ended up having to wait another 10 minutes or so (Why even make a reservation?!). Being from California I have been to my share of table top cooking Korean restaurants and they usually have the large rectangular grill that you can put lots of meat on at once. Red Kimchi had a small round grill that seemed to cook unevenly. I asked for a Thai Iced tea and the waiter stated that it wasn't good and I shouldn't order it and I awkwardly said..ummm...ok nevermind. So we order the Galbi short ribs and the spicy Korean pork. The waiter (who I think was the owner) came back with the raw meat and explained that he goes out himself to select the best angus beef for his short ribs. That was a nice little story and the meat was very good quality. I must say the portion was very small for the price paid, $20 for 3 pieces of short ribs. This is not usually the case when I have gone to my Korean BBQ spots in California but this is Arizona and there aren't many Korean restaurants around. The spicy pork was very good and the portion was decent. The restaurants I've been to in the past usually have a lot of kimchi and appetizer sides don't know the proper name) and I was hoping for those cold clear noodles, but it never came. We just got a couple of mediocre pickled items (maybe 3 or 4) and some kimchi lettuce. They did bring out a nice little dessert for his birthday which was yummy. The thing I love the most about going to Korean restaurants with tabletop grills is the fun of cooking it. I didn't get to do any cooking because the waiter popped in every two minutes to snatch the tongs and mess with our food, which is fine if I didn't want to do it. Overall the food was pretty good but maybe ill stick to going to a Hawaiian place for my short rib cravings.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Here on a Friday night!
