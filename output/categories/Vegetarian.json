As a vegetarian and a Thai food lover, I was really excited to see this place open up on my side of town.  \n\nThe restaurant wasn't very busy when we got there, but since it is fairly new I figured they were still building up clientele. We ordered a Thai tea and a glass of wine which came out promptly. They have a separate vegetarian menu with meatless forms of all the Thai standards, and it includes options for adding soy duck, chicken, or fish.\n\nI started with a bowl of Tom Kha soup with tofu and vegetables. Tom Kha is my favorite Thai dish, and I order it at every Thai restaurant I try. This was hands down the best Tom Kha I have had in Las Vegas!  I highly recommend this soup when you come here. For our entrees we split an order of panang curry and the Kinnaree special noodles with added soy chicken. The curry was very savory and creamy, and the noodles were pan fried with their special sauce which I also found delicious.  All of the food was excellent and our server was very polite. We ordered all of the spicy meals at level 4 - I felt that it wasn't as spicy as a level 4 at Archi's or Lotus. Next time I will probably get a 6. \n\nAt this point I had already decided that this was my new favorite local Thai restaurant, but what happened next really confirmed it. We went outside and discovered that we had a flat tire (and no spare). Our waitress came out to check on us when she saw us looking at the car. We were planning on calling a taxi, but our waitress insisted on offering us a ride home as it was near the end of her shift. She asked for 10 minutes to finish up, so we waited out in the lot. About five minutes later, her manager came out with a bottle of fix-a-flat and insisted on helping us plug the flat. Five minutes later, we were on our way home!

I'm not sure when this place opened, so I'm also not sure if that sticker belonged to the restaurant before it or not. (Both have had great reviews on yelp). The restaurant is quaint.

It looked quite popular. \n\nTo start, I ordered a thai tea. Sweet, yummy, refreshing.. can't really go wrong with thai tea. \n\nThe free egg rolls were pretty standard.. vegetarian egg rolls. They may have been frozen actually.. but I'm not picky.\n\nFor my entree I ordered the beef and meatball noodle soup. It was on the lighter side, the broth was clearer than I'm used to for a Thai beef soup. The flavor was not as intense as I was used to either. But it wasn't bad. Just different. It ended up being exactly what I needed as I wasn't feeling so well and wanted something really soupy vs flavorful.  \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the fried pork and chinese broccoli. That was REALLY good. The fried pork belly was crunchy and fatty (if you're going to order pork belly, you have to know it's fatty to begin with. So no complaining here!). And the Chinese broccoli was cooked perfectly. Firm and crunchy on the outside, and soft on the inside - al dente. And the flavor was excellent.

The chinese broccoli looked old and wilted.\n\nThe only reason why I didn't give 1 star is because the service was good and our waitress was really nice and pleasant.  Also, they serve fountain sodas (which I like) instead of soda from a can like how I usually see at Thai restaurants. \n\nIf you like meat and you like your food to have flavor, then don't eat here!

If you've ever been to Komol and had the pleasure of trying the version there, then you probably don't need any convincing, but it's a a wonderful combination of veggies, tofu, nuts, fruit, hot pepper and lime juice.  Sounds like the worst health shake combination ever but trust me in salad form it's a delight.   As much as I love Komol it's quite a drive for me from home or work so I dont make it there nearly as often as I'd like, though the herbal salad has made it difficult to stay away.    Well salvation has come in the form of Kinnaree having the exact same dish!   \n\nSome quick background on Kinnaree:  in doing my daily yelp search I saw some positive reviews being thrown their way and figured I needed to try it as I do all Thai restaurants in the area.   Well imagine my surprise when Google Maps led me right to (formerly known as) Lilly's Thai restaurant.   I felt swindled to be honest.   Lilly's was always decent, but not something I ever craved, so I was worried this was simply a name change and that I'd have the same underwhelming experience I felt I'd had in the past.  Then I saw it, written in marker on a chef's special board \"herbal salad\".    Could it be the same as Komols?!  Or was this some mirage and Kinnaree's version would consist of a bowl of ground up Basil, Oregano, and catnip?   I'm happy to report it was the former, and I've since gone back several times to get it take out.\n\nIn my 4 times having it so far at Kinnaree, 3 of the 4 times it has rivaled Komol's version, with the perfect amount of spice (5 out of 10 on their scale) balanced out by the sweetness of the coconut and apples.   One time it was drenched with way too much lime juice but thankfully that hasnt been the norm.\n\nI was hesitant to write this review as I was worried a lot of you savages would go and start ordering this dish and make it harder for me to get.

The spring rolls were really good, and came with a really great sweet and sour sauce. The cashew nut was also quite tasty. If there was one thing I didn't like as much, it would be the coconut ice cream. I believe it was vegan ice cream, which means it's non-dairy and nonfat, which sort of sucks all the fun out of ice cream. But on top of that, the ice cream had chopped up green beans and corn in it.

I love Thai food and have tried almost all of the options in Las Vegas.

From ordering to being served, I waited barely 5 minutes.  The portions of salad and rice were both impressive, about 2 1/2 cups for the Som Tom and about 1 1/2 cups of rice.

One of the best Thai meals I've ever had was overshadowed by some service faux pas and thus they lost a star in my book... but the food (!) oh the food... \n\nWe began our meal with a sampler platter, it was a big plate of deep fried beige. Normally, this would repulse me and wish for some creativity, but I gave it a go before I started my ranting and it was SO good! the thai rolls are your basic deep fried spring rolls, at least the ingredients were fresh. but the plum sauce was great and it went well with the fried dumplings and I always enjoy fried tofu!\n\nI ordered #850 the Lard Na. Thick noodles in a gravy with veggies. I was happy with it. I ordered it to be cooked at medium heat with a chili tray. Our server was very happy to accommodate me. :) But the highlight of the meal was my friend's meal. He ordered #812 Thai Beef Jerky. It was a nice hunk of beef that was marinated and then deep fried and served with sticky rice and a nice dipping sauce. It was crispy, tender, flavorful with a combination of spices I never really had before. I loved every bite I stole from my friend. The sticky rice went perfectly with it. It was served on this leaf atop a plate and the leaf perfumed the rice. It was a perfect dish. I *need* you to give it a try also!! \n\nWe capped off our meal with the Fried Banana & I cream. An Americanized Thai classic done right. I could have used a lil LESS honey in all honesty but that's just me. \n\nNow for the bad news...\n\nEveryone at the table got their food except for me. It took another 20 minutes for me to get my Lard Na. *harsh sigh* really?? I know Thai places usually serve food as its ready and not necessarily when the table's orders are all completed. But 20 minutes! Come on! AAAAND... the worst food crime didn't even happen at my table: at a table near me, a dish of hot food, pineapple fried rice maybe and the guests were a little bewildered at its sight but still began to eat it. They used the serving utensils and dished some of it out, one of them put the utensil in their mouth and began using instead of a fork or chopsticks (something I do sometimes too) . They laughed about getting free food... at the same time, another table got their food and same thing... one person was left out. **harsher sigh** and THEN the server realized what she had done, she gave the dish to the wrong table. So in what I consider to be very gross more than anything. The server grabbed the rice dish and its utensil that was sitting next to the dish on the table  from the table it was delivered to and brought it to the table it was supposed to go to. half eaten, with an obvious dent in it. Before the guest could say something, the server re-fluffed the rice and left the table. **shudder**\n\nTo My Fellow Yelpers: That's gross. And yet I stand by my 4 star review. The food's THAT good! But when you go, be sure to keep an eye on the servers.

The Crispy Roasted Duck.\n\nThe duck came on a hot skillet and it was a very generous portion being topped with fresh basil and caramelized onions. The duck itself was cooked more than I would have preferred, but the skin was crispy and the meat was very tender and flavorful. It was very good and I have been craving for it a past few days. Hard to beat good duck......\n\nI also got a soup with coconut milk, mushrooms and chicken. Overall the soup had a great depth of flavor and was also very rich. It was also really really spicy, which made me want it even more.\n\nOverall Yupha's really surprised me.

I don't usually venture to Tempe but a date suggested it so I was excited to try it! There aren't many Thai restaurants in the Phoenix area and the ones I used to frequent have been closed for awhile (thaifoon and jax).\n\nThe decor is okay (as a designer I'm kind of critical) but as for being in a strip mall, the decor is great!! We went early on a Sunday night so there was no wait. The server we had was sweet and attentive and our food came out very quickly. \n\nI ordered the chicken coconut soup (which I love but haven't had since jax closed). The portion was rather small but perfect for a starter. I ate every drop and still had plenty of room for my entree (and usually I get stuffed pretty quickly). It was really flavorful with big chunks of chicken. \n\nThen for an entree I got the yupha's fried rice with chicken because of the rave reviews on here from other yelpers. I concur - the best fried rice ever!!! I will be craving it!! Love that it had the pineapple and cashews and nice big chunks of good quality chicken. A little heavy on the onions for me but I just picked them out. Again, AMAZING!\n\nBoth the soup and fried rice I ordered as MILD and they were that - just a tiny bit spicy. I was scared to order MEDIUM but I like a little more kick so I'll try it next time. \n\nMy date didn't want anything for dessert but I had to get something. I asked for the mango sticky rice (which I love) bit they said the mango aren't in season right now - which is fine - I'd rather not be served hard mango chunks and be charged $7 for them! Will have to come back when they're in season. So i ordered my second choice - homemade coconut ice cream over sticky rice. The ice cream was a little hard and icy (probably because they make it) but it was still super yummy with the rice and I ate almost all of it myself (my date doesn't like coconut).\n\nI got the jasmine tea to drink. However, it comes without a strainer so all of the tea leaves pour into your cup! I asked if it was supposed to be like that and she said yes. I just didn't like having to spit out or chew on any stray tea leaf I drank. I noticed if you pour it and let it sit a little bit most of them go to the bottom - but by then it's a little cold. \n\nAnd I do agree with other yelpers that the prices are a little high for the quantity of food, ambiance and location.

The veggies were fresh, as well as the salad. I mean I can drink the peanut sauce, it was that good. By the time we were half way into our salad, our Siam wrap came. Excellent! The minced chicken was great! very well seasoned, I even used the peanut sauce with the wrap as well. Now came the Goodness, That was quick, was my reply. The drunken noodle was fantastic, an even amount of ingredients, the chicken was perfect, it seemed like some of the chicken was shredded, not a bad idea! The Red Curry was to die for, not literally. It had a different flavor, that I'm not used to. It had a lemon grassy flavor, the curry was thick, not too fishy, and a plenty even amount of ingredients. \n\nOur table was completely covered with food.

While I think the $3 up-charge for like four scallops (cut in half) was a bit much, I enjoyed this dish!  The pineapple really adds a brightness to the otherwise heavy dish.  They even threw in the pineapple boat... which ended up getting tossed after I kept spilling curry all over the place.  \n\n- Pad King Sod with Calamari ($13):  Squid stir-fry with ginger, onions, mushrooms, and bell peppers in its simplest form.  I was hoping for a balanced dish but all I got was an overwhelming garlic flavor.  I love garlic but whoa!  It was a bit much.\n\n- Tom Kha Gai & Seafood Soup ($4 & $6):  The Tom Kha Gai here is delicious!  It might've been the blinding craving for coconut milk soup but this stuff hit the spot.  It was silky and coats the mouth!  The chicken was a bit dry but what can you do about white meat chicken really?  The Seafood Soup was mainly eaten by Mr. W.  It tasted of your standard hot & sour soup with lots of lime.  The seafood soup was definitely not my favorite.\n\nThe decor was lovely and I almost wished I dined-in instead of carried out.  The service was friendly but for $61, I was hoping for a little more.

The last time I went here our server recognized us and said, \"I recognize you!  You guys come here often!\"  This place is always busy, so it was incredible that our server recognized us as quickly as she did.  Perhaps it's the strangeness of our order - I generally order things just under Thai hot, and she orders things with no spice at all.\n\nI generally order the Pad Thai with an appetizer (often their spring rolls).  They're very conscious of dietary restrictions:  I order my dish with tofu, and they always ask me if egg is okay.  I love that they do that.  I've always found their spice level to be spot-on.  My dishes have the right amount of heat, and my friend never complains about anything being too spicy.  I really appreciate that they trust me when I order my dish hot, but I've also seen them bring out jars of chili flakes and chili oil to patrons who are requesting something a bit spicier.\n\nThe portions are perfectly scaled.  If I'm ravenously hungry, I can eat the whole plate without feeling overly full.  If my hunger is at normal levels, I can eat about half the plate and will end up taking the rest home as leftovers.\n\nThis place is always busy for dinner, but I've never had to wait to get a table.

Avocado or squash in your smoothie, pomegranate or hemp in your brown rice bowl? Yes, please!\n\nI know it's expensive and it's also got a douchey factor but then again, doesn't everything before it becomes a mainstay of an area?

I have now been to both locations a total of 3-4 times so I have tried.  I am accustomed to paying a lot for food as I travel and Grabbagreen could fit right into an airport for overpricing.  I also am used to paying more for fresh, organic salads / food.  That said, I have never left that I was not still starving to death. Today  I paid $10 for the make your own salad which contained approximately 1 1/3 cup of kale, 1 T grated carrot, 1/3 cup black beans, 1 T grated beet, 1 T bean sprouts, 1 t mint and about 2 T of dressing (these are generous estimates).  They would have also included probably about 1 T of feta cheese but I am vegan.  I asked to sub in another vegetable or another herb to replace the cheese.  I was told that due to \"policy\" I could not do that but could pay an extra $0.75 for a t of herb or T of vegetable.  Now I am a consultant and engineer so I decided to run a little experiment, knowing full well that the cheese was one of the more expensive items and that they were financially ahead to honor this request especially since they tout vegan, vegetarian and gluten free options.  I went to Whole Paychecks and purchased the exact same ingredients.  Then I calculated how much was in my salad and what the food cost was.  Now this was paying full and marked up retail so a good bit more than they pay.  The food cost I estimated without the cheese was $2.66 which like I said I paid $10 for.  This was a 3.77 X markup which is healthy in the food industry.  The cheese cost was about $0.50 based on my numbers and was easily the most expensive thing except for the greens themselves.  So in other words they could have had both a happy customer and a lower cost salad for themselves if they were not so obtuse with their \"policy.\"  Will I go back - probably but only because one of my buddies loves this place.

I had the pot stickers, Red Curry with Duck, and mango with sweet sticky rice.  \n\nThe pot stickers were very appetizing.  They were very well prepared, and had an interesting sauce that is reminiscent of a thick creamy sauce that would be served at a Japanese restaurant.  Perhaps not authentic, but very tasty.  \n\nNext up was the Red Curry with Duck.  I was a little disappointed with this, enough to the point that I am giving this review three stars.  Although the ingredients tasted fresh, I felt that there wasn't enough meat and other fillers in the curry.  The pineapple chunks were fresh and not canned, but very small.  On the good side, the curry was styled how I prefer Thai curry; soupy over white rice.  However the flavor of the curry was a little bland compared to the bold tastes of the (old) Thai Grill.  The duck meat was tasty, but again seemed to be skimpy.  \n\nThe mango with sticky rice was good, but I've had better.  The mango was sliced very thin, which was impressive.  The taste of the mango was a little bland though; I've had sweeter mangoes at another Thai restaurant.  I realize that these can be seasonal, and even the other Thai restaurant is having trouble getting good mangoes this year it seems.  The sweet sticky rice was yummy, although a little soggy from the coconut juice.  I've had better sweet sticky rice that wasn't soggy at all, so I'll have to rate this as good, but not great as well.\n\nOverall, this was a more disappointing meal for me compared to the previous visit, but I would still eat here again.

You can barely read anything that says Thai Restaurant, but instead look for Noodle House... you'll have a better chance in finding it.

Something about the thin fat noodles that makes it so much more enjoyable.. Absolutely loved this combination. I also requested to add extra sliced garlic... and even though the server looked at me like whoa are you serious... I told her I was sick and needed the extra garlic to help me get well. Then she understood and added it on. She even sprinkled fried bits of garlic on top to finish it off. How sweeeeet!!!\n\nWhen the soup came... boy was it in a huge bowl. I was so delighted and happy to see such a generous portion given to little ol' me. Yes I blinked a few times out of excitement and joy to see this beauty of Tom Yum unfold before my very own eyes... the colors were beautiful and vibrant.

One sip and I was in LOooove. I literally said Aaaaaaaaaaaah. *sighed on how good this tasted. I mean the elements of tangy and spicy hit the right notes and everything blended ever so nicely. The pork meat was tender, fish cake and balls were soft and fluffy, and the flat noodles I can't stop raving about. \n\nI literally took half of the soup home and ate it twice throughout my day.

She sked me what my name was and before leaving suggest next time to order the original Tom Yum to help my sickness since it's more stronger.

Waitstaff attentive in service. My favorite is Yellow Curry with Pumpkin, Mixed Vegetables and Salmon made special order...request granted! with saucy flavor of coconut milk. Still affordable despite the additions to the order. Other variations of Salmon dish choices I try each time I visit. \"Pad Thai\" and \"Hoi-Tod\" (fried pancake with green mussels) is yummy.

So, here it is...finally.\n\nThai Style Noodle House offers both Chinese and Thai food, but mostly Thai.  Our party of four ordered a few dishes to share so we could sample a bit of everything.\n\n* Beef / Pork Jerky \"Beef / pork marinated in special Thai herb, dried in one sun and deep fried\" ($6.95) - We chose the beef option and the Husband is the real expert on this since he tends to get it a lot.  I found it to be just okay though, it was a bit too dry for me.  (Whereas other places make their variation a bit more moist.)\n\n* Grill (Chicken, Pork, or Beef) Salad \"Your choice of sliced meat cooked with red and green onions, mint leaves, ground roasted rice, chili, and lime dressing.\" ($6.95) - We chose the beef option and the Husband loved it.  I thought it was just okay and lacked something - a bit more sauce and zest would have been nice.  Then again, this is something that the Husband has had a lot of.\n\n* Roasted Duck Noodle Soup \"Noodle with boneless sliced roasted duck and Yao Choy in Thai herb duck broth.\" ($6.95) - This wasn't my top choice to order, and it was just okay.  There was nothing special about the roast duck at all.\n\n* Pad See-eu \"Stir fried flat rice noodle and egg, Chinese broccoli in sweet black soy sauce.\" ($6.75) - This was okay with chicken and greens, although it was a bit flat.\n\n* Red Curry \"Thai red curry with your choice of chicken, pork, beef mixed with bell pepper, bamboo shoot and basil served over steamed rice.\" ($6.75) - We chose vegetarian with soft tofu and I'm always a big fan of Thai curries.  They didn't disappoint here - good flavor and spice.  This was the real winner for me and I definitely would be back to try out their other curries.\n\nWe also had Thai iced teas all around.\n\n* Mango with Sweet Sticky Rice ($3.50)\n\n* Fried Ice Cream ($3.50) - It had a nice crunchy batter with little ruby-like things in condense milk.\n\nThings I do appreciate about Thai Style Noodle House is that there are a lot of vegan and vegetarian choices, and they don't charge for brown rice.  I also like when they offer you a choice on the tofu - soft or fried.\n\nService - it was busy the evening we went and with one waitress, she was kept on her toes.  She was friendly and on the top of her game, but then again, Bobby Y. (a regular) was dining with us.  So I think that may have helped us there.\n\n3.5 stars\n\n(I'm confident that I would give them a four star if I go back and try out their other curry dishes.

It wan't served traditionally with a cabbage wedge, but rather with chopped iceberg. Though this is a little unconventional, I liked the salad quality of the dish. The green curry fried rice ($7.95) is filled with fresh veggies and tender slices of pork, and has a slightly creamy quality. If there was risotto in Thailand, this would be it. I also enjoyed the Choo Chee Shrimp ($8.95) and Spicy Green Beans with silky chicken ($6.75). The Beef Noodle Soup ($6.50) had an exotic favor sweetened by spices, though the beef itself wasn't as tender as I would have liked.\n\nEverything on the menu is so inexpensive you won't worry about looking at the lunch special menu, but if you are dining alone or just not a \"sharing\" kind of eater, these options will allow you to try several different item combinations for under $7.\n\nDownside: If the place is very busy, it takes awhile to get your food.

I love garlic ok it does the body good! The soup came out in zero time and I loved the way it smelled. The steam evaporated in the air in slow motion, made it looks so heavenly fresh and I had to take a snapshot of it against the sun.. it just looked so Food Digest front cover magazine-ish. I sipped the soup broth first, it was like liquid nitrous for my engine.. my eyes lit up and made my facial muscles break a happy smile. I literally said Mmmmm gulping it down... Yea tell me about it... sound good right??!? It tasted so good, my own body melted. It had bits of cilantro, diced green onion, bean sprouts, and TONS of chunky sliced white chicken meat.

I'm not shy when it comes to eating and definitely will eat to my heart's content, bet your butt I will! So I just smiled at the guys and kept on eating. I'm enjoying my meal, so let it be! The dessert was the icing on the cake... the finishing touches of a great phenomenal meal. The mango was riped and perfect to eat. Every bite of the sticky rice was warm, soft, and soothing.

It's my favorite Thai dessert from any other. \n\nTheir food has been consistent every single time I have gone here and the service is always very attentive and friendly.

This so-called Thai restaurant seats about 20 people.  Their menu is actually a mix between Chinese and Thai food.  \n\nIt was really disappointing to open the menu and see things like Orange Chicken on the menu.  Really?  Really?!  They don't even have basic Thai appetizers such as angel wings or fish patties.  We were actually debating to leave the place without ordering because it did not have a lot of Thai dishes, but the employees were too nice so I decided to stay.\n\nWe ordered two dishes (because there really wasn't anything else on the menu that sounded Thai, nor appetizing) -- Boat Noodle Soup and Chicken Basil.  The noodle soup had a good flavor, but they did DUMB IT DOWN BIG TIME for vegas locals.  They did NOT have the pork rinds, blood, lliver, and tripe that a boat noodle soup usually has.  The broth was really sweet too, which was overpowering until I added my own chili flakes to balance the flavors.  \n\nThe chicken basil was ok tasting, but wasn't great.  The place definitely dumbed down the spice factor too -- considering we requested \"medium\" for both dishes, the dishes were NOT spicy at all.  Again, I think this place is catering towards a clientele that can't handle much spicy food nor distinguish between Chinese and Thai food. \n\nMy bf pointed out their water is filtered, which is a good thing, and that they \"flavor\" their water with slices of lemons and oranges in the water pitcher.  Just fyi for those picky water drinkers out there.  This also tells me that their soups, most likely, have a better taste because the water is filtered.\n\nI would only come here again when I'm craving (semi) Asian food in Vegas and  cause it's cheap -- for two dishes it was only $14.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "So after a Glorious Day in the sun and hitting up some of the Vegas pools...my roomie his girl and myself defintly had the munchies...we were sitting in the car exiting Encore trying to decide what we wanted and I was like...\"Dude I always see you bringing takeout from that Thai place...I've never been, lets go!!!\"...Awesome Thai Style Noodle House it was!\n\nGoing into the place I knew beforehand it was kind of a hole in the wall kinda joint...small and cozy, it was about what I had expected...about room enough to hold 25-30ish peeps at a time betwen different 2 seaters, 4 seaters, that could be pushed together to hold more (like a 10group that was chowing down as we entered)...1st things that hit me were the smell, and I automatically saw how big the soup bowls were from the 10group...YUM!!!....My mouth had allready started watering!!!

Of course we were greeted warmly with the never fail big Thai smile from the hostess that I've come to expect from the Thais when I meet them.\nThere were computer printout menu items with pictures scattered around the walls as well, and coupled with the Thai TV programming and Tshirts, I was reminded of a typical Thai noodle shop one can find all over Thailand.....(sigh, I miss you).\nI noticed on one of the printouts a picture of Penang Curry with avocado. One of my buddies wanted that, and when I mentioned to the waitress that he was a vegetarian, she quickly produced a completely separate vegetarian menu. That was cool, although he stuck with the avocado Penang curry with tofu. He ordered it at #9 of 10 in spiciness.\nMy noodle soup arrived and was promptly devoured and washed down with a Thai iced tea. The broth was hearty, the noodles soft, and there was a large chunk of baby bok choy, and plenty of bean sprouts to compliment the meatballs and sliced beef. I thought the soup could've used a touch of cilantro, but it was very good and well balanced. I also tasted some of the avocado Penang which I thought would be too hot for my tastes, but turned out to be just right.

It took me awhile to order & the waitress asked me instead if I want mild, medium, or hot for my spicy eggplant with beef and green curry with chicken. I thought that was weird, but I got hot (whatever that means). Lunch specials also come with a choice of eggroll or fried tofu & a little salad. We got home & dug in. The spicy eggplant was nothing special and the green curry was not as basil-y as others I've tried. The vegetables in the green curry were kind of funky, as in, they weren't very bountiful or filling and I have no idea what anything else was other than the green beans (even those I'm uncertain of). Anyway, my other complaint is that \"hot\" was not hot. My 2 year old was digging in, and she's not one for super spicy foods. Overall, I'd say lunch specials are fair and the food was alright.

Their normal entrees of Thai staples like fried rice, pad thai, and pad see ew were pretty decently priced. For the price, the portions weren't too bad at all. For the taste and the service, it's a little bit iffy.\n\nWhen I received my order of pad thai, the thing I noticed was a good third of my plate was occupied by bean sprouts and the rest of noodles. They have this illusion that you got a lot of food, when all you got was an average amount. I did not really like how they did that, but it was $6.95, what's there to complain about? The taste of the pad thai was how you expect it to taste, so nothing funky there. When the pad see ew came, a lot more food looked present than in the pad thai. That was a very good sign to me! But the bad thing was that it had a funky after taste that I'm not use to. It's not the typical taste that I have had at other places, and the aftertaste wasn't a good aftertaste either. I don't know if that's how they normally make it or it was just that day, but I didn't like it too much. The fried rice that my friends ordered though, especially the fried chicken fried rice looked pretty epic... I should have gotten that, had I known how much they would give for that. Well, their portions were good, but it didn't really make up for the service that bothered me a little bit. \n\nThe waitresses were nice and served us appropriately. They took our orders in a timely fashion and refilled our waters before it hit the bottom of the glass, but the thing that bothered me was that they rushed our party a little bit toward the end of our meal. This particular location is a little small, and so larger parties are going to have a hard time being seated. My party consisted of 6 and we had a little trouble being seated. When another party came in that was 6 as well, they kind if made it a point they wanted us out to sit the next people. I understand it's a business and they want to make money, but you shouldn't shoo away the customers that you have for the next set. That's fairly rude if you ask me. So after a bit, my friends finished eating and we headed out. \n\nI won't be coming back here under my own choosing.

Here is the chronology of what happened:\n\nWe initially went to Pam Real Thai just a mile over based on the review.  Looked really interesting, but alas, it was closed because they were only open for dinner.  So we looked up this place on Yelp and decided to head over.  First impression good, there were a couple of party waiting outside for a table for this small joint.  About 100 degrees outside so not too pleasant, but looking forward to the food.  We put our name in for 2, but there was a party of 9 in front that they said would need to be seated first.  No problem.  We wait about 10 minutes, and the big party goes in to get seated.  In the meantime there were a couple other small parties that came around, but we didn't pay attention too much.  Another big party of 8 comes, puts their name in, and waits.  10 minutes or so later, the party of 8 goes in!  I go inside to check out what's going on, and the small parties that came after us are also seated already!  So I go over to the counter and ask them when we were going to get seated, they look at the \"wait list\" and our name is still on it, with people below us crossed out!  What the heck?  They realize, say \"oh\", and says, \"sit over there\" and points to the empty table.  No apologies, just a point of a finger.  Man, food must be really good here to tolerate this, I thought.  We later witness that there is another party getting a similar treatment so notching this one as an inefficient system that has got to get fixed.\n\nService does not improve as the meal goes on, however.  We flag the server down to order our drinks and food, never got served water, and they never checked up on us for the meal.  Onto the meal.  We ordered a Thai Iced Tea, Thai Iced Coffee (no difference as Vietnamese one), Yellow Curry, and Spicy Fried Rice.  In general, everything was good.  But both the curry and rice was too salty.  The dishes were plain, no garnishments, and smaller in size to justify the cheaper price.  So not necessarily a bargain.  Tea was good, no complaints, coffee was typical.  So overall 3-stars for the meal.  If it wasn't so salty, the curry would have been great.\n\nSo throughout the meal, the servers never approached us, we called them EVERY TIME.  To order, to ask for anything, to ask for the check.  That gets a zero in my book and I let the tip speak for that.  I pay for the food, I tip for the service.  Servers should always remember that, I don't care what you get paid.\n\nTable-for-1 Factor:  They had lone diners, so it is fine.

But...I had to oppurtunity to peruse their aisles and these guys have everything an Indian cook/home may need or want. Pickles, multiple lentil varieties, exotic Indian vegetables, flour, spices...everything was perfectly laid out and easy to find. This store is definitely bigger than any other Indian store in Las Vegas. It's well-lit, well-organized and well-stocked. The trifecta. \n\nBonus points to them for their frozen food selections which were not unnecessarily marked up in price - something that the other Indian grocery stores seem to be doing that I frown upon. Gopal's for example, crosses out the manufacturer's suggested price sticker and charges a dollar or two more. These guys don't (at least not yet). \n\nI haven't had a chance to taste their Chaat offerings as today was free food for all and so the lines were out of control.

They have also some more common spices that I decided to get here as the prices are really good. For example, I almost bought a $6 jar of cinnamon sticks at the grocery and it's $1.99 for the same amount here. A nice sized jar of spices start are mostly about $1.99 with the harder to find spices like green cardamom pods are around $4, very few are over that. For those who need spices in mass quantities, they have huge value bags as well and they seem to be a better deal than buying at Sams/Costco. I also hoped I can find some fresh herbs and they indeed had fresh curry leaves and fresh fenugreek. If you're not into the cooking stuff, there are plenty of tasty and interesting looking snacks and prepared packs of food. We bought a few heat and eat packets and some were good and some not.

The Philly Cheese steak burger was very good, too.  Both were very juicy, needed plenty of extra napkins!!  And if you must have fries with burger (like its optional), go for garlic fries.  They have an interesting way of making them, they use minced garlic!!!  Lots of garlic and one serving was more than enough for two. You can get about 6 differnet mustards and four types of mayo.\n\nBut like is not all burgers, they have beer!

That may sound expensive, but for Las Vegas I think that is pretty reasonable after everything is said and done.\n\n*Quality & Taste - A lot of fancy restaurants overcharge for a standard hamburger, but this place really brings flavor and juice to its burgers. Not to even mention there are a ton of options to put on your burger and make it how you really want. I got the Cowboy burger and added a fried egg, to give it a ton of extra flavor.\n\n*Portion Size - Burger is huge. You will be full after eating it.\n\n*Atmosphere - It's in NYNY, so when you're eating there, you feel like your actually in a city. It's pretty cool have they have a whole section for restaurants in the area, so when you walk around you'll see a NY Pizza place and so on.\n\nCONS\n*Caesar Salad and Fries - Really the only negative I saw with this place was the Caesar salad and the fries.

I am also a lifelong fan of Thai food.  I used to live in NYC and Boston and have eaten in Thai restaurants all up and down the East Coast.  I've been to Koolthai a few times, and I am impressed.  It's all the dishes you would expect at a Thai restaurant, but with a bit of gourmet flair.  For apps, the Thai Crackers and Thai Wings are both terrific.  The Thai Crackers are crispy clusters of rice (think Rice Krispy Treats, without the sweetness/stickiness) that are dipped into a stew of coconut milk and ground meat.  Something different, and totally delicious.  I had the Thai Wings tonight, very crispy, served in a garlicky brown sauce.\n\nFor entrees, my favorites are the Spicy Catfish and the Crispy Pork.  Growing up in Kansas City, I've eaten plenty of catfish in my life, but Koolthai's catfish was probably the best I've ever tasted.  I almost hesitate to say that because it sounds so gushy, but I can't remember ever having better.  Tonight I had the Crispy Pork, which is simply amazing.  It's fried pork belly (which manages to stay remarkably crispy) sauteed in a garlicky brown sauce with Chinese broccoli.\n\nFor dessert, my favorite is the fried banana - banana rolled in brown sugar with very fine coconut, fried in a rice wrapper, with a bit of syrup to top it off.  The coconut melts with the brown sugar to complement the banana nicely.  The Thai Mango (slices of fresh mango on top of sticky rice) is also good, as are the green tea and coconut ice cream.  The coconut ice cream isn't made with dairy but with coconut milk, and it's obviously very coconutty (yes, I realize that's not a real word!).\n\nKoolthai is less than a mile from the Wynn, just a bit off the beaten path over on Highland Drive.

I have to say, this little Thai restaurant was quite nice.  The location is a bit hard to find.  It is basically underneath Desert Inn (well, kind of North of the bridge, on S Highland).  Although small, the atmosphere was nice.  They put some money into decorating the inside.  The waitstaff was friendly, yet professional which is something I think they hit right on the head.  Overall, while not the best Thai food I have had, it was actually quite impressive!\n\nFirst up was the Crab Rangoon ($6.00).  A guilty pleasure of mine, this is an appetizer I often turn to at a new Thai restaurant.  The wonton shell was perfectly fried, not too crunchy, not too thick.  The inside was more imitation crab than cream, which was nice.  The sweet and sour sauce had a nice little kick to it, and tasted better than average.  Not too sweet, just the way I prefer it.  They provided me with a unique tasting chili paste, which spiced up my sweet and sour sauce a little more.  I quite enjoyed these.\n\nFor my main course, I ordered the Gang Kua, a red curry dish with duck.  I had it over brown rice, which was very well prepared (nice and fluffy, yum!).  It came with a slice or two of tomato, pineapple, and various herbs and spices.  The heat level was very moderate, so I added more of the chili paste that I was provided.  The duck was the most impressive thing about this dish.  They lightly shredded the duck, and as a result it was very tender and easy to eat.  There was very little gristle, and no bones.  It was a higher quality duck as well (less fat and gristle).  The pineapple was sweet and fresh tasting.  The curry was subtly flavored.  I would say it was a little Americanized, but still was tastier than most red curries in this town.  I would prefer it to be a little stronger in flavor, but I can appreciate the need to cater to a broad audience.  What counts is that the curry was decently unique and very easy to gobble down.  \n\nWhile they cater to the average customer, and there are a lot of Chinese dishes on the menu, the level of food here may be better than most places in this area.

The Thai iced tea was generously (no promises for anyone visiting in the future) refilled, which I hear is really only unlimited at Weera Thai - this menu does not advertise free refills but I think the server was being sweet to our group.  I am not sure why there were dual prices on some dishes, because we thought it was lunch/dinner but I got charged the cheaper price so I am not clear on that.\n\nWe all ordered different things but I sampled everyone's dishes.  I had the spicy green beans with tofu in a chile paste/kaffir lime sauce spice 8 of 10.  It was definitely spicy and tasty.  No one was offered brown rice so I am not sure if we could have asked for it or not, but we all got white rice for dishes except for noodles of course.  My dish was good with heat and flavor, and I liked the tofu texture (sort of medium firm).\n\nThe other dishes I tried: pad kee mao with tofu (yay Chinese broccoli, but boo mushy noodles and had no spice - it had to be added with paste at our table), kool ginger beef (baby corn, unique non spicy sauce), beef panang (a bit thin but tasty), gang kua shrimp curry (not something I had ever tried, but it had pineapple and a nice flavor), and spicy mint chicken (chicken was ground which menu did not mention, but juicy - jalepenos supposed to be in dish but never saw them, loved the mint and basil in the dish).\n\nOverall, everything tasted good except the mushy noodles, and the service and Thai tea were great.

The Tom Kah soup is excellent; great balance of the coconut and citrus, broth and meat. Lastly, their noodle dishes. I'm not particularly a fan.

In fact, when I first moved out here, the first restaurant I looked for was a Thai place.  I had asked locals and one of them recommended this place.  The restaurant is in a quiet plaza, and all the times I've gone there was around 9:00PM and there would be maybe two or three parties already seated and a couple more would stroll in as I waited.  I always ordered my food to-go, so I don't know exactly how their in-restaurant service is, but as far as to-go orders, the service is fast!  The food is pretty good, I usually order Pad Thai and Red Curry with chicken and it's delicious.  The only complaint I have is that there are only four levels of spicy.  I've always experienced a spice level either on a 1-10 scale or a 1-12 scale...with only four levels, I feel like it's either going to be too spicy or too bland.  There's nothing in-between for those who aren't sure what level to get.  The first time I went, I got a level 2, and it was okay (but, I do have a high tolerance for spicy food).  The next time I went, I tried the three and it was waaaay spicer.  The spiciness between the levels 2 and 3 was an extremely drastic jump.  I love spicy food so I didn't really mind, but if you're unsure, I suggest getting a level 2.  My food usually came out within 10 minutes of ordering it, and the servers always ask if I want water while I wait for my food, which I don't experience often while ordering to-go, so it was a nice touch.  The prices are pretty decent considering it is a sit-in restaurant and the portion sizes they give you.

Maybe it was because I didn't have it in the restaurant and it was delivery but it was not crunchy and fresh tasting like it should be.  Last thing about the Papaya salad and this could just be me but I personally like it when the peanuts are ground and put on top so I can mix them in and not whole and just thrown on top.

Every foodie can appreciate proper business practices. Its one thing to run a business; its another to do everything possible to make money but do it with your dignity and integrity intact. \n\nBURGER: A burger with 2 patties is the norm. You have 3 options: beef, veggie w/ mozz, or vegan. A single patty is a \"kids burger.\"  Because eating a single patty is only enough to feed a child...  After selecting your patty-options, you move on to building your own masterpiece by selecting as many of the toppings as your heart desires. A slice of fancy, aged cheddar cheese will cost you some extra cents though. The beef is a little softer, definitely leaner than most places, but it has a  refreshingly clean taste. I can tell the cow or cows it came from were happy, free-range, and grass-fed. You can taste the different.\n\nFRIES: Never have I ever had fries deep-fried in olive oil. Essentially, olive oil is far healthier than the usual vegetable or canola. But the smoke point is significantly lower so it yields a soggier fry. Mine were a little limp and a little heavy on the salt. \n\nSHAKE: If my friend didn't have an appreciation for ice cream. It never would've occurred to me to order a milkshake.

On top of that, I gave up red meat for Lent.  So what do I do to satisfy my craving? I yelped vegan & Elevation Burger came up. \n\nWhen I walked in, my children & I were greeted by this friendly, young fellow. He told us about their their ORGANIC grass fed beef, ORGANIC veggie burgers, potato buns & how their fries were cooked with olive oil. SOLD! I'm all about the healthier lifestyle. Even though it's a bit pricer, I opt for the ORGANIC or natural stuff. As you probably already know. You can really taste the difference plus it's better for you. I'm very cautious on what my kids eat. All these gmo's, additives & crap that's put in food these days. It's scary. Watch the movie The Beautiful Truth & you'll know what I'm talking about.\n\nThe cashier who took my order was a cute & sweet young lady. She was telling me how this restaurant just opened recently & how good the shakes are. They use real fruit & some ORGANIC products. They have ORGANIC milk!  If I didn't have dessert earlier, I would of ordered one but I will definitely order 1 next time. That ORGANIC cheesecake shake caught my eye.\n\nSo I ordered my son a ORGANIC grass fed beef burger & my other son a grilled cheese. I had the ORGANIC veggie burger #2. When you order,  they have a list of toppings so you can just tell the cashier what you want on it. Cheese is extra. Which I didn't mind because they use real cheddar cheese. We also got 1 order of fries which was enough for me & my 2 kids.\n\nOMG! My veggie burger was so good & fresh. Cooked just right! The fries were skinny, crispy on the outside & soft on the inside. Very addicting & not that salty like some places where they get real heavy handed w/ the seasoning. If you do like it saltier, you could always add more. Not a big deal.\n\nBoth my sons enjoyed & finished their meal. My kids are real picky eaters too.\n\nI can't wait to come back & try the shakes. I don't think they have ORGANIC condiments, so I think I'm going to be a little ghetto & bring in my own ORGANIC condiments next time (shhh). \n\nHow exciting that this place opened up for people like me & my family looking for healthier alternatives when we go out to eat.

One of my readers tipped me off to this place a few months ago before it opened, and I've been very intrigued since reading about their organic ingredients and healthy approach combined with their use of environmentally sustainable architecture they strive for at each location. So does this all add up to a good burger? Yes it does.\n\nCarrying the organic theme in their interior, the restaurant is sparsely decorated with bamboo-topped tables and chairs, bamboo floors, and most likely a company-wide color scheme of two tone set of blue tiles. The space has a good feel to it; as I said it almost seemed like there were too few seats but once I did a quick count and saw several more people come in during my visit it seemed just right. Also in keeping with the simplicity aspect they have one of those new fancy coke machines that makes like 200 different combinations without having a whole line of fountains.\n\nThe menu has everything from single- and double-patty options, to veggie burgers, grilled cheese, a large variety of sides, some great shakes and even mandarin oranges. And what's even more helpful for those that care is the calorie count for each item is prominently displayed. But the star of the show is all in the ingredients; the burger for example is made from 100% USDA-certified organic, grass-fed, free-range beef, and you can taste the difference. Even the fries are made with olive oil, and the cookies are made with organic eggs and butter.\n\nI of course had to go with their Elevation Burger which has double meat, double cheese (real cheddar) and the \"original\" toppings: Elevation sauce, pickles, lettuce and tomatoes. Double meat and cheese sounds a bit similar to another certain place, huh? The look of the burger and fries when they arrive at your table are even a bit familiar, but the similarities stop upon first bite. You instantly taste a unique beef flavor that stands out from many other fast food-type places. The patties are thin, but juicy and hold a very prominent flavor throughout the meal. The bun is great; very sweet and soft, reminiscent of a Hawaiian roll. The lettuce, tomato and pickles are all fresh and good, with the lettuce being used sparingly and just right. The cheese was melted thoroughly, had good flavor but I found myself longing for a little more sharpness to it. I hate to keep going back to it, but by the end of this burger I really felt like I had finished a not-too-greasy burger with great, fresh ingredients similar to when I finish an In-N-Out burger, and I don't think that's a bad thing by any means.\n\nThe fries are also really fresh and great; one serving is more than enough for two people. The fries on my first visit may have been a bit hard and overcooked, but on my second visit less than a week later the fries were soft and just right. I also had an Oreo shake on my second visit and it was great. A very intriguing offering on their menu and something I will most likely have on my next visit is the option for them to scoop some ice cream onto the root beer they sell by the bottle.\n\nThe overall price of this meal is a bit more than the place I keep comparing it to, but I think you're paying for the ingredients as well as a slightly better, less hectic atmosphere. The double burger I had starts at $5.29, with another $2.69 for a double helping of fries. $4.19 for a shake might be a tad high, but it is really tasty if you feel like splurging once in a while.  I will also add that Sean the GM of this location is really nice. I have a habit of leaving a business card behind at most places I review, Sean got in touch with me within an hour of my visit to see what I thought, so I made a point to ask for him on my return trip. All of the employees are very friendly, the food is great and it's a really nice atmosphere.

The burger came out pretty quick and you could taste the difference in the patty comparing it with larger fast food chain quality burger patties.  The cheddar cheese was excellent and sharp.  The burger was juicy and I enjoyed every bite.  The fries are nothing special and also on the pricey side.  Their iced tea has a hint of sweetness.  Usually, I get my iced tea unsweetened and I hate the sweet kind, but this subtle sweetness was pretty dang good.\n\nI think Elevation has a good business model and the prices are a bit higher due to the grass fed beef they use in their burgers, but I think the price point is still a tad too high for what it is.  But nonetheless, the burger is solid if you want to try it.\n\nWHAT I ORDERED:\nMain ---\nThe Elevation Burger: 4/5\n\nSides ---\nFrench Fries: 3/5\nThree Small Cookies: 3/5\n\nSTAFF:\nVery friendly\n\nWAIT TIME:\nNone.

But, if you know me, you'll find this is a good stance to take. I eat meat. A LOT of meat. But I also adore vegetables and find them much more versatile to cook with. I just usually try and combine the two (so order a meat and veggie curry for example). Taking the active decision to eat somewhere that serves no meat didn't strike fear into my heart (I adore a rare steak and sweet potato in equal measures). But I was curious to see how satisfied I would be.\n\nWith a very good friend visiting Edinburgh, and said friend being vegetarian, I made it my mission to find her the best place in Edinburgh for a casual evening meal comprised solely of things she could eat. After a quick Yelp search it seems that Henderson's Bistro combined the laid-back mid-week charm we were looking for.\n\nThe Bistro is just two doors down from the Restaurant. I asked the waitress what the difference was between the two. She explained that the Restaurant has more salads on the menu, very good value at lunch time apparently, and also live music. But they seem to have the same range of deli / bistro style offerings.\n\nThe ambience is definitely friendly, warm and very down to earth. Nothing fancy but homely. The waitresses were both extremely sweet and friendly. I probably wouldn't come here for a date, wrong type of 'nice', but it was just right for catching up with a good friend.\n\nSo, to the food. Yum. Num. But not Yum num num. Why the missing 5 star? Well, let me start with the Yum and Num. We each had a pate to start, I had the spicy bean pate. And oh yes that shiz was good. I would happily buy it in pots to take home. A generous serving, very filling, and with a hidden mushroom at the bottom - win!\n\nWe both had the moroccon stew as a main. It was a very generous serving, and veggies are filling. There was potato, carrot, aubergine (I LOVE aubergine!) in the stew, maybe parsnip too. But a distinct lack of chickpeas (this made me really sad) and maybe apricot or something to make it more authentically Moroccan. It was delicious, but just....lacking a wee bit.\n\nI did also like the drinks. The menu is quite extensive, and I enjoyed a gin and tonic (with a local gin), a prosecco, and a rum and ginger ale (with a local rum and a nice, natural ginger ale). After the drinks we managed room for pud - the cherry pie. I tried this specifically after reading Amy G's review. It was wholewheat and vegan. It wasn't very sweet at all, which is good, but I felt it was a little pastry heavy and not quite cherry-ish enough despite having whole cherries in it. But still, we finished it. It just didn't blow my socks off.\n\nIt also made me a little sad that there weren't more beany / legume options on the menu. There was a nut burger, but no other option. And not many sweet potatoes. My favourite veg are beans, sweet potatoes, and aubergines. Maybe it's because I'm not veggie and am completely ignorant - perhaps beans are considered lesser veggie food? \n\nIt's still a solid 4-stars. The bean pat\u00e9 was really to die for, and the whole experience was just delightful (especially because of the really friendly staff). Maybe if there'd been more chickpeas, beans and sweet potato involved I would have knocked it up to 5. \n\nI think it's been around since the 1960/70s and whilst this is really impressive, I felt perhaps they were resting in their laurels a little in being an Edinburgh Institution but not keeping up with what's hot.

This time I had the special, Spanish Stew. I asked what veg was in it, and was told sweet potatoes, beans, carrot etc. Now, I imagined it to be brimming with several different types of beans.

Definitely would recommend this place and next time we're in Edinburgh we plan on stopping in again.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "This is a relaxed vegetarian bistro with great salads, interesting main dishes, and meat-less burgers.  It has a wonderful vibe.  We slipped in later on a Friday evening and got a table for two. They have a great selection of organic and vegan wines by the glass or bottle.  Those with dietary restrictions will find the menu clearly labeled and they will prepare many dishes without gluten or dairy.  They also try to source as much local and organic products as possible.

Apparently they are also open until 1am 6 days a week too....hummm.....\n\nStopping in on my way home from work hoping to find some veggies.  On first glance through the place I was excited, thinking, \"cool my own salad bar near home.\" Then as I  took a closer look...the quality of said veggies, well that was another story.\n\nThe employees probably never eat salad or veggies by the look of the dry wilted zucchini, cucumbers, celery, carrots, bok choy...\nTo their credit the main piles of spinach, romaine and mixed greens were fresh.  The side salads looked like they had been sitting out all day as did the dressings.  \nEither cover the items, take the time to stir the salads/dressings, or put out less and replenish frequently.  All of this could be resolved with a swift kick to the ass of some obviously lazy employees. \n\nI wanted to take my salad to go and they charge by weight but I was not given a to go container.   I was told to use a plate, put it all together and then I had to dump it in to a container after it was weighed.  HUH?!  \n\nThese plates are huge and plastic, and I doubt that they tare out the weight of the plate.  I didn't get a whole lot of salad considering the quality of the toppings and it came to $9.  WTF?! I can get the whole kit and caboodle at Souper Salad or even Sweet Tomato for that price (or less).  I rarely even pay that price at Whole Foods when carrying out a salad there.  \n\nNo wonder this place was empty....\n\nI wish this place was better....", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 4, "useful": 8, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "This place does not impress... but I wish that it did!
