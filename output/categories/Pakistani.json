The restaurant is very plain and we went our tablecloth was a bit dirty and there was a vaguely unpleasant smell in the air. The smell was probably just an unfortunate combination of spices and foods from the kitchen, but this could really do with being closed off from the serving area, not only to prevent a medley of odors, but so the diner isn't deafened by clattering of pots and pans and so on.\n\nI ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, garlic naan, pappadums, the basmati rice, and water for my beverage.  Instead of the usual Indian restaurant theme of refreshingly iced water topped up the second I sip from my glass, I was surprised to be presented with a single bottle of Kroger water which I had to sip sparingly lest I have to shell out another dollar for another.\n\nThe pappadums were OK, but unremarkable, not unlike the pre-made ones you get from Indian grocers and then stick in the microwave for 45 seconds. Instead of the usual bowls of mint or cilantro chutney and tamarind chutney these came accompanied by a couple of roadhouse diner style squeeze bottles filled with some sort of condiments. Both were extremely runny, almost a water consistency, one seemed to taste vaguely of tamarind and I couldn't identify the other.\n\nMy Garlic naan was the highlight of my meal and had that certain mix of denseness and crispness that's the hallmark of a good garlic naan.\n\nThe rice was pretty good also, cooked with saffron and ghee and very plentiful for just a couple of bucks.\n\nThe main meal, my Chicken Tikka Masala was just ok - the chicken was of good quality and well cooked, but the sauce lacked a certain deft touch and was a little aggressive as the spices didn't all blend together quite how I like. I'd be very happy if I had cooked this up myself at home, but it's a notch below what I expect at a restaurant.\n\nThe people running this place were very friendly, but it was a rather odd experience. At around 8PM we were the only people in the restaurant and it was a little strange and awkward having the guy sitting there in the tiny restaurant 15 feet from us while we ate.\n\n One thing in Shalimar's favour is the prices - they are very decent. We didn't hold back on breads and rice and things and our entire meal for two (including bottled water) came to just over $25.\n\nThis is the sort of place I could imagine myself coming to regularly for a cheap lunch if I worked in the area and was limited in where I could travel on my lunch break. The food is good enough and cheap enough to eat again. For a dinner out; however, the atmosphere here is little above that of a food court and the food is only a few points above mediocre. \n\nWorth a look for the price, but go in with low expectations.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I give this place 3.5 stars. The food was pretty tasty, so it is very difficult for me to take off stars, but  the ambiance and the water issue was large enough for me to take off the stars. Let me explain: Upon entering this establishment at lunch time, there was no one there, except for a middle-aged couple (I guess the owners?) who didn't greeted us haphazardly and had us sit whenever we wanted; The ambiance gets about 1.5 stars at most (and this is due to the nice burgundy table cloths, otherwise there will be no stars). The place looked clean enough, but not appealing. The artwork was of posters in super faded colors, and looked as though it was purchased from Saver's. Did not visit the restrooms, but imagine they were just as boring and unassuming. \n\nOnce we were seated, we were given laminated green menus that looked very cheap and unattractive. Tables are covered in plastic over the tablecloth, which skims the knees and looked a little dirty. Again, very unappealing. There is a cash register on a very medicinal looking counter and a coca-cola cooler next to the check out counter--very unappealing once again.\n\nWe were brought Kroger bottled water upon requesting \"water with lemon.\" My friend did say not to expect lemon, but I did expect nice, refreshing water in an average glass with ice, instead I got Kroger bottle water ($1 each). My friend asked: \"Can we please have free water?\" at which point the server/owner brought a pitcher and two styrofoam cups for us. Upon taking a swig of water, I almost threw up. It was THAT bad. The water tasted like it came out of the sink of dirty dish water, literally. I think the previous yelper who commented about Shalimar possibly having plumbing issues was onto something. I called the server/owner over and told him that this water was undrinkable, at which point he exclaimed \"the water is bad here, I told you it's no good here.\" Take it how you may...\n\nI am glad that I waited for the food, although I was very close to walk out judged by this water incident and by the decor. The food was good. My eggplant dish was delicious and so was onion naan. My friends' lamb dish tasted a little reheated, but tender at the same time, she liked it, but I didn't really care too much for it. Lamb is best eaten freshly cooked. The rice had a variety of colors and was a little too oily, also tasted reheated, but not bad. Bottled water was as you would expect  :) .\n\nService was very good, as expected since we were the only people there. The owners/servers were very friendly and very helpful with my food allergy concerns and ingredient questions. Especially the female owner. The male owner was a little grouchy at times. We continued on being the only people there for the entire visit. The owners did remark that they are very busy at night, which I had a little hard time believing, but good for them. I love mom/pop places having success in their endeavors.\n\nPrices are good here, especially for vegetarian and vegan dishes. I found out that many vegetarian dishes are, in fact, vegan which is rare in Indian cuisine. As the owner explained, they are Pakistani and use much less dairy than the Indian cuisine. Kudos for that.\n\nBottom Line: I will go to Shalimar again in the future if I'm craving Pakistani food. I will order vegetable dishes and naan only and drink the $1 bottled water. I will stay away from lamb/meat dishes and rice.  I will smile and converse with the owners, but I will not like the decor or the water problems.

Self-serve chai is always a plus. Have eaten there twice now, and the same dishes were consistent and it is refreshing to see reasonably priced a-la-carte naan ($1.50) and rice ($2.95 for a very big mound on an oblong plate - enough for 2 persons.) Sidenote: Pet peeve is when restaurants 'getcha' on the sides that you depend on, like rice, miso soup, etc. Some of the worst offenders in my experience have been China Grill at Mandalay Bay ($7 bowl of white rice), Gaylord India at Rio ($7 plate of white rice), Nobu Matsuhisa locations ($5 for small cup of miso soup), Olive Garden ($4 for a side of marinara sauce to go with your free breadsticks). Most of these 'getchas' show up on your bill by surprise.\n\nBack to the curry at hand: Shalimar serves up quality, cheap and generous vegetarian curries (the eggplant masala and mili juli(sp?) mixed vegetable curry and yellow dal are all top tier) and the Chicken Tikka Masala is excellent as well. We ordered everything \"medium-hot\" and it came out spicy but not stupid spicy. Spice is dialed in with experienced hands in the kitchen over at Shalimar. No flavors were ruined with too much spice here. And the flavors are complex and different in every dish. This is important because sometimes I swear that when we are at an unfamiliar Indian restaurant and we order 4 different dishes, they use the exact same curry base in 3 of them, hoping we don't notice. Not the case here. Shalimar makes each dish with singular care.\n\nFood is basically 5-stars in my book, but the lack of ambiance (i.e. fluorescent lights) brings it down a star. Certainly not a first (or second) date kind of place. Instead you will see husbands and wives, families and groups of friends.\n\nWe're going to sit in view of the kitchen next time so we can see the behind-the-scenes. I really like eating here. It's a nice flavor change-up from our other favorite Indian spots such as Mint Indian Bistro, Namast\u00e9, Rani's World Foods Thali counter, and the Indian counter at the Riviera Food Court. \n\nWarm-up note: both times we've had enough left over for lunch for two the next day.

My ego was fragile and my belly empty, so I skipped the Yelp Talk and went right to the \"nearby\" button. \n\nImagine my surprise when a Pakistani / Indian / Afghani place popped up a mere mile from my hotel!  This restaurant sits inside the Zam-Zam World Market, and boasts a solid lineup of dishes from three countries, all at very reasonable prices.  \n\nI could write nothing about the food here and still give it 5 stars because of the service we got here.  Our server was genuinely excited for us to be there, and happy to recommend what he believed to be great dishes to match our relative tastes (mine being super spicy, and my companions being the opposite).  I love it when I get actual recommendations, not the typical, \"everything is good.\" \n\n When he learned I wanted something he would traditionally eat, and also super spicy, he easily sold me on the Goat Karahi with the chili naan.  Having never tried Goat, I was super excited.  My buddy went with the kabobs per his recommendation, with one being mild, and the other with a little spice.  Great recommendations all around.\n\nWe started with the samosas $1:50 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z-grill-phoenix?select=9RTXS536Au1v8PfemgIXzg#tno1avQ14jhuMNrXANswow), and they were executed perfectly, with a cilantro chili sauce that had a great kick.  5 Stars\n\nGoat Karahi $10  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z-grill-phoenix?select=9RTXS536Au1v8PfemgIXzg#bHaip3hWpni9l_SB9pB3pw\n\nThis was basically a short rib dish with garlic, onion, and lots of spice (your cumin, turmeric, red pepper blend being very pronounced).  It was fire hot, and the meat was like a pulled pork consistency, and almost creamy.  I wish I would have ordered regular naan, because every time I went for the naan to balance out the fire, I was met with thai chili on top of naan.  Needless to say I was smoking out my ears by the time I finished. \n5 Stars\n\nThe kabobs were great, and with the Tandoor oven banging out quality naan, this was a meal I easily could have eaten when I was in the region.  Fantastic service, fair prices, and great tastes.
