I like a lot of it, and dislike a bit of it. \nThey have a decent wine selection, but I'm a fan of Rhones & Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape's...and the selection here lacks in that department. To be fair, the selection in a lot of places lacks in that department.\nThe owners are super-friendly and the place is super clean! The cheese selection offers quite a few artisanals that are pretty hard to come by, along with a good selection of other cheeses you are familiar with. The deli meats are great, and the sandwiches are HUGE. Think about sharing them. For sure.\nBeer selection is good, and they have even ordered some hard-to-find stuff for us. I won't tell you what it is, because then it may not be there when I get back!\nMy only problem with the place is size. They really need to double the space, just so there is some breathing room between tables. The tables need to be bigger too.  It's really hard to enjoy the nuances of a wine and great food when its all precariously scrunched together on a bar-height two-top that's serving duty as a four-top. A cigar-friendly patio would be awesome, also.\nIf you were lucky enough to stop by when they first opened, you might have scored one of the few wine lockers they have. But, unless someone moves out of the area - I don't think you'll get that chance. I'd bet there is a waiting list. Luckily, my buddy scored the biggest one they have - so between his house, my house and the locker we usually have a few choices when we want to do some tasting on our own turf.\nSo there you have it - a nice little place with wine, cheese and beer staffed by some great owners.

I wish I was more competent with my word processor, because I'd like to divide the review into three columns: Very Successful, Adequate, and Giant Flop. I think it would mean more if you could see side-by-side comparisons, but you'll just have to try and visualize it.\n\nI'll be nice and start with the Very Successful column.  (1)The menu: it's full of innovative selections. There are a number of Tapas, such as fried plantain cakes topped with grilled mango poke, seared pork belly, and a habanero vinaigrette ($8) and salmon cakes with chipotle molasses ($7). Many of the entrees come with interesting sides and sauces, for instance grilled pork tenderloin with a pan seared goat cheese polenta cake and roasted peppers, finished with a chipotle, espresso and raspberry BBQ sauce ($18). Which leads me to the Most Very Successful item of the evening. (2) Ken ordered one of the specials, a New Zealand farm-raised venison 2 rib chop with a juniper berry marinade, accompanied by spinach and roasted potato hash and the raspberry espresso BBQ sauce. Given how far the deer had to travel, the $32 price tag didn't seem too unreasonable. The chop was truly superb, moist and flavorful but not gamey. The sauce suited it perfectly. (3): portion sizes were quite generous. And (4): White anchovies were featured in several of the dishes.  That's it for the Very Successful.\n\n On to Adequate. (1) The ambience is pleasant, if somewhat noisy. There's a bar, with a television above it, high top tables, and those of regular height. The paintings on the wall are for-sale originals, some good, some not-so. There is a patio (this will also appear in the Giant Flop column). (2); Our dessert selection of chocolate mousse cake was \"corporate food\", not made in-house, and nothing special, but certainly both edible and size-able. The coffee fell in this column, too. (3) The nicoise salad ($12) ordered by our friend Sena came with seared Ahi tuna rather than the canned variety packed in olive oil. This would have put it in the Very Successful category for me, but Sena likes the more traditional canned tuna. \n\nOK. Here's the column you've probably been waiting for: Giant Flops. I'll start with (1) the above mentioned patio. The misters were on and it felt like London on a foggy morning. When we asked that they be turned off, nobody warned us that we would get dripped on, and our drinks would get dripped in. We soggily moved inside. (2) Sangria shouldn't be offered unless the proper ingredients are available. The white sangria ($5 at happy hour) given to us had a few slices of lemon in a poor quality wine. When we told our waitress that it was unacceptable she brought us a little carafe of \"berry juice\" to add to it. This made it even worse. (3) Nobody should ever put slices of cucumber in drinking water. While it may look stylish, after about 5 minutes it tastes really strange, and after 15 it's horrible. Imagine drinking it while eating chocolate mousse cake!! (4) My entree. I ordered one of the specials - fried chicken marinated in buttermilk, served with gouda mac & cheese, sauteed vegetables and a rainbow peppercorn gravy ($18).\nI asked for all dark meat, and my plate arrived with two huge chicken legs. I thought the coating was good, although the crispness of the coating was quickly lost to the gravy. The first few bites were quite good, the chicken was moist, with a pleasant taste. But then I noticed how pink the chicken meat was getting as I got closer to the bone, and it was actually almost raw in the center. The second leg, which I had given to Ken was somewhat smaller, and he said it was adequately cooked. The mac & cheese, if it had a flavor, was drowned out by the gravy which was cough-inducingly peppery. The sauteed vegetables consisted of a few strands of bell peppers. \n\nWhen our bill arrived, $6 had been deducted from the price of my entree, and we had not been charged for the sangria (which we had not drunk).  As we were leaving the restaurant a woman whom I assume is the manager asked how our meal was. I politely listed some of our complaints and she seemed genuinely upset and was quite apologetic. While we were getting into the car she came out to the parking lot and gave us a gift certificate to use if we'd give D'Vine a second chance. Because of the items in the Very Successful column, I think we will.

As soon as I walked into the resto, I noticed that the noise level was high, even though there were only 6 or less patrons (including me), plus 3 or 4 employees present.  Ambience was OK- portraits of past actors and actresses (era of Grant, Monroe, and Gardner) and black or dark furniture, etc.\nSince Violeta had arrived earlier, she already had a glass of wine in front of her.  After a few minutes, our server came and asked if I would like to order a drink- I asked if I could sample a couple of red wines.  I had sensed that he might not have liked this request, but he said sure.  After I'd made my decision and let him know which, he dropped off the selection shortly, but took awhile to bring me a glass of water despite my asking for one earlier.  Again, it wasn't busy at all as it was only around 430p.  \nAly D. arrived, and after chatting it up a bit, and waiting for our server to come back (maybe 10 to 15 minutes of lag time), I placed my order of bruschetta of brie, marinated artichoke, and smoked salmon (brie, apple and slivered almonds; artichokes, roasted red pepper pesto and goat cheese; salmon, mascarpone, olives, and capers) and Violeta asked for sweet potato fries.  We continued to chat and sip our wines (Aly D. only drank wine; she didn't have anything to eat), and after about 10 or 15 more minutes, the bruschetta arrived.  After taking a few photos of the dish and offering the two women some of the pieces (Aly refused and V. opted to wait for her fries, which hadn't arrived yet), I chose to start w/ one of the roasted red pepper pieces, and after attempting to knife into a corner, and not succeeding, I picked it up and took a bite.  The bread they chose to serve me was stale!  I spat that out, and, wanting to ask V. or Aly to confirm that the bread was indeed stale, I tried to slice off a piece of bread, and pieces flew across the table.  Finally, I was able to hand a sample to V., who agreed that the bread was stale.  After a few attempts to flag our server down, at last he came back to ask how I was enjoying the app (Violeta's fries still hadn't arrived).  When I told him that the bread was stale, he vehemently denied that the bread could be stale, as their bread is made in-house.  He then just left it at that, panning over the three of us, and after a few uneasy seconds, he asked if I'd like to order something else.  I was taken aback by his reaction to my observation and decided that I didn't want to order anything else, so I just told him to take the app back.  Before he left, Violeta kindly reminded him that she still didn't have her sweet potato fries, so he went back to the kitchen to check on that.  I don't know what the other two were thinking, but I was still reeling from our server's remark and how he had handled the exchange.  A woman came by to drop off the fries, which were tasty and very crispy, just the way I liked it (thanks V. for sharing!), and soon after, our original server arrived back to say that the chef had sampled the returned bruschetta, had agreed that the bread was not up to standards and would like to know if I would like to have another prepared.  I said yes, I'd love to try again.  Finally, a solution was offered!  But why did it take all those many minutes?  The second plate arrived, the obligatory picture-taking done, and I took a bite of the salmon, and all was well again in the universe!  This time the bread was NOT stale, and while I liked all of the selections, I wouldn't order this dish again.  \nWe continued to chat and enjoy our wines, but I still wanted to try something else, so I asked for the Cuban sandwich, which arrived after a few minutes.  (Strange, but I couldn't find a photo of it,nor the fries, in my collection, so perhaps V. or Aly took pics for me?  Please send them over!)  This tasty halved sandwich was quite petite- about three bites, four at the most, and one half had the two kinds of meat- ham and smoked pork (?) and some sort of cheese and the other half only cheese.  My lack of concentration w/ my selection is testimony that I did not enjoy my experience here at D'Vine...  \nBecause of 1.) the many failed attempts to flag our server down, 2.) the long waiting times in between server visits, 3) the lag time of the sweet potato fries, 4.) our server's reaction to the stale bread, 5.) the miniscule sandwich which only had meat in one-half of it, and 6.) the resto's noise when it wasn't even busy (the noise grew as the afternoon turned into night), I will never go back again, not even to try their lunch menu, which is a pity as the eight selections featured, each at $7.49, look promising.  In retrospect, I wished that we had  stood up after the initial reaction to the stale bread and gone with V.'s suggestion to go to Cork and finish happy hour there.

I ended up here because my date suggested it. I was going to give it 3 stars but there were a few things that kept me from doing even that.\n\nLet me start off by saying that the restaurant is in a very nice, if not a little off the beaten path, of south, south Chandler. The inside has a nice, cozy feel to it, albeit a little on the dark side. Our table, in particular, was lacking in basic lighting. Anyway, that's just a tiny complaint compared to the service and the food. \n\nAh, the service! At first it seemed as though things might go pretty well in this area. We were promptly seated, asked about our drinks and even managed to put in an order for an appetizer, all within 10 minutes of sitting down. Not bad. The food came out pretty fast but I don't think it was anything to write home about. It wasn't spectacular, just ok. I received my drink, called the Pink Puppy, and I had read in a couple of other reviews on here how \"wonderful\" it was. I wasn't impressed. I guess this place just shoots for mediocrity because that's all it was--mediocre. \n\nLuckily, I was so distracted by my charming date that I didn't realize until my stomach started grumbling again, that I was still hungry. A few strips of calimari split between two people isn't very filling. At that point, I realized we had probably been chatting for a full half hour or more and our waitress was nowhere to be seen (it was later on when I got up to go to the bathroom that I understood why she was MIA. I'll get to that in a minute.) Finally, she must have noticed my date doing his head-bob to get her over to the table. We were able to get our order in for the main entree. I ordered the salmon dish over risotto. It was, again, just okay. Tasty, but I don't think I would rush back to order it again. The center was a tad underdone, but I eat sushi on a regular basis so I didn't complain. The risotto was a bit mushy but still had some flavor to it. The real disappointment was in the dessert.  We ordered the chocolate mousse pie/cake--not quite sure which one it was trying to be. The texture was so bad I couldn't eat but a few bites. There was nothing \"mousse-y\" about it. It had the consistency of dried out Play-doh. Yuck! And I am a dessert person, 't boot! I love my sweets and can eat just about anything with sugar in it. This was inedible. I'm not sure why we didn't send it back and our waitress never questioned why 3/4 of a supposedly decadent dessert was still on the plate. \n\nAfter dessert I got up to go to the bathroom and saw why our waitress was so slow in coming to our table: She was too busy chatting it up with the other customers to pay attention to her tables. \n\nSo, in summing it up here is my take on this restaurant:\n\nGood atmosphere\nMediocre food\nBad service\n\nNot a winning combination if you are a small business trying to make strides in today's economy. This establishment needs to really take a look at itself (and these reviews!) and improve where improvements need to be made. I find it very interesting that this place is owned by the same folks who have a d'Vine location in Mesa. That restaurant fairs much better in the Yelp ratings.

It's all fine and good to meet up weekly at the local watering hole for a few drinks but every so often you need to class it up a bit.  The Momo is the perfect solution.  I'm not what you'd call a connoisseur when it comes to wine but I'm not afraid to learn.  Over the last few years I've gone from a complete neophyte to being able to order a bottle of wine at a restaurant without resorting to random selection, and this is mostly due to nights at Cafe Montmartre with a group of friends trying different styles.  Not that it's just a wine bar - there's a halfway decent tap selection usually including Lake Louie and Ale Asylum, and they've got Macallan 12 year amongst other single malts.  A word to the wise - pick one and stay with it.  The last time I hit the beer-wine-whisky trifecta I did not enjoy the next day.\n\nAside from the drinking selection, I love Cafe Montmartre because of the music.  I've been to quite a few different shows here, from Ben Sidran to the Bastard Sons of Johnny Cash.  It's a very intimate venue that allows you to be within feet of the stage while still sitting at the bar.  The flipside to intimacy is that it can be crowded and sitting at the tables along the wall doesn't always allow a view of the stage.  However, the covers are generally cheap and the sound levels are pretty good.  The only downsides are that the crowd can get a bit too talky during shows and the shows themselves tend to start late, making for a long night for those gainfully employed and/or too damn old for bartime, i.e. me on both counts.\n\nSeveral times we've dug into the menu, and my personal favorites are the goat cheese nachos and the baked brie.  I've never gone just for dinner, more for shared appetizers.  The pizza is quite good too.  I've never tried the sandwiches but last time I did get the aged gouda, which was delicious once we thought to take off the wax - it's a bit dim in this place.  The main knock on Cafe Montmartre is the service, and this is completely spot-on.  Usually I just go to the bar to get a drink, which is an imperfect solution because the bartenders can be a bit standoffish.  Still, the service as a whole isn't a deal-breaker and generally comes across as inexperience.  It seems to be a bit better if you sit outside on the sidewalk, but that can get a bit smoky for some.  The place is on the high side in terms of price but I've never felt ripped off.

Personally I prefer to determine the service charge based on the quality of the meal and service......I also tend to tip more than 10% if I feel it has been earned.\n\nOverall I was not disappointed by the food, the service or the venue so if you want a nice meal in the centre of town then I would say give it a go but if you do then be sure to add 10% when you are mentally added up the cost of your meal.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I've lost count the amount of times I've come here for chicken fajitas!

Now, when a large slate appears with 4 thinly folded slices of salmon and that is all, I have to admit my heart sank a little. Surely Monteiths wasn't a coquette, only to not deliver? No garnish, no side-salad, just a little drizzle of balsamic on the slate and a wee mound of rock salts. But when I tasted that salmon....oh my. Exquisite. Words cannot describe. I had to ask to see the menu again to discover how it was smoked and flavoured. Whisky, orange, other foodgasm type flavours. Any relish or salad would have killed it. This was perfection.\n\nThe duck with merquez sausage and white beans for my main was also superb. Not quite as *knock your socks off* memorable as the salmon (which I can still taste.

Hire only attractive student girls (from Surrey it appears) to wait tables.\n2. Market the Swanky City Cocktail bar vibe in a predominately student area without charging student prices.\n3.

On a whim I did a search for a North 53 restaurant...bingo, Edmonton.  North 52?  London.  North 55?  Northern Ireland.  Holy crap, it's true!  I could run a blog where I travel the world visiting a restaurant named for every latitude. \n\nI'm waiting Hollywood! \n\nThat being said, I'm sure there would be at least a few degrees missing--not sure if there's one at the North Pole.  Taking this train of thought, would there be duplicates in the South, and would they be the Norths' mortal enemies?  Would they explode if they touched each other like matter/antimatter?  I have to check--HOLY SHIZZA, there totally is a South 55!   \n\nUpon passing 56 North, I couldn't help but enter.  It's a modest bistro where sections of charcoal tiles and tan wood panels spread across the floor.  Matching tables and chairs are frugal; the tables feature hooks for people to hang bags from....novel.  The bar carries enough alcohol to inebriate all of Goldie Hawn's children.  The menu is the definition of humble--one paper affixed to a clipboard.  A clipboard. \n\nNo really, a clipboard. \n\nThe prices are very reasonable with only a few items over ten quid and only one at seventeen pounds.  I opted for two starters rather than one with a main.  The first was a pork belly & black pudding filo parcel with homemade apple jam.  I then followed it up with the autumn vegetable soup.  While the filo parcel was amazing, I thought the soup was honestly...the best word to describe it was fibrous, which is...totally a word I just discovered.  Thankfully, it was only a daily soup, which means I hope that in the future it won't repeat.\n\nA good meal and a good value.

I've said that I loved and still do love the look of Edinburgh--the stone construction, the towering spires, the fact that the city is perpetually moist all the time--but I do appreciate it when I cross the threshold to an interior and find it upbeat and modern.  There's a TV, but it's not a pub.  It has a bar but it's not a club.  56 North is comfortable.  It's like a giant pillow in front of a fire on a cold night.  It's where you take someone to hang out with for two hours.  It's where single guys work off a pint of bourbon and lament the days when they were in love. \n\nOkay, that last one doesn't sound very fitting, but I could totally see it happening.   \n\n56 North gets my recommendation because it was unpretentious, welcoming, with better than average food.

A great wine list is available, showcasing an excellent range of wines and champagnes to suit different budgets and the provision of water without it being requested, is a nice touch. \n\nWe were intrigued by the offers of 'little bites' to then book a table for dinner which did not disappoint. \nA small but varied menu offers lots of choice of seasonal produce with meat, fish and vegetarian options available and for anyone with special dietary requirements, then the staff are more than willing to accomodate you (I'm GF and never been poisoned thanks to the very knowledgeable staff). Past options have included pork and lamb (none of which I would normally order but have been divine) but the little bites, which can include calamari, whitebait, haggis, haloumi and many other choices, are a great way to sample multiple little dishes tapas style and start from only \u00a31.

Every once in a while you have a dish that just makes you go \"wow\" and smile from the inside out. Yes, this dish was that good.

I'll echo other reviews in noting that the bites are a great idea, and as a person who likes to try everyone elses food, I got to indulge that in having a selection of bites to myself. Breaded brie - too strong for my tastes, overpowering the tomato salsa that is was accompanied by; fish dumping - tasted fabulous and I could have eaten 10 more; charred halloumi with some seriously tasty (nut-free) basil pesto. The SR checked out the haggis bonbons with chipshop sauce (chipshop sauce not as good as the real deal apparently), and my nephew loved the lamb offering. \n\nFor the mains... I'll admit, I was surprised. Given that the bites are truly bites, I didn't expect the portion sizes to be as big as the mains were - not massive, but solid cuts of fish and meat were on display at the table. Most of us tucked into the John Dory, which was cooked beautifully with a seared diver scallop (so tender, it was embarrassing how much I enjoyed it) and a wild salad... the nephew had the sea trout with a solid serving of mussels, and the SR had the pork belly... which disappeared almost instantaneously as it arrived. Triple-cooked Chips (cooked in veg. oil) were fantastic, and the only downside was some nasty tasting asparagus (felt like they had been burned by garlic... didn't taste right personally, but my sister and her friend both enjoyed it). \n\nOf course we had to have dessert as well, and the bite size came in handy, as I really only wanted a little sample rather than a whole dessert of the chocolate and raspberry tart... and the richness of the dish really meant that bite size was more than enough for me. \n\nI think the only downside is that while the waiting staff were very friendly and pleasant, at times I felt pretty rushed, and while we were left to our own devices (despite being told we were supposed to vacate by 9... we left after 10), no-one really came by after dessert, so any prospect of drinks disappeared... not that we needed anymore - but it felt rather like a feast, then a famine.

We were the only people in the place- sort of a plus in some ways, not so much in others. I am not sure if there is a different chef on during lunch than dinner, but I hope so. We ordered the crostini with hummus (eh), black olive tapenade (eh) and tomato something (this was actually really good) to start off, and bottled water. The bottle was already open before it was brought to our table. Not that a big deal, but I should have gone with no ice (duh) because the drink smelled and tasted like Phoenix area tap water. Is it copper or iron? Hard to tell around that calcium taste. I dunno, you be the judge. My friend and I wondered if it was a 'fresh' or 'refilled' bottle. Whateva on that, we ended up not being charged for the it. My friend had the sliders; I ordered pecan-crusted salmon on spinach salad with raspberry vinagrette. My friend thought there was too much sauce on the sliders; I kind of agreed but it didn't kill the taste of the fresh beef. The salmon was ABSOLUTELY PERFECT, it had just enough crust on it without overwhelming the fish, and cooked perfectly. YUM. The salad... eh. The vinagrette lacked dazzle, and this seemed to be 'compensated' by drizzling a lot over the spinach and salmon. The spinach was very fresh, but would have been better plain than with that stuff. It was disappointing enough that I said something about it to the waitperson. Oh yeah, and apparently there was a special of the day... which we found out after placing our order, when we overheard the next couple who came in ask if there was one. I dunno, maybe our fault for not asking? Well, even after a less than stellar lunch, we decided to go for that flourless chocolate cake I had so coveted. Eh. Again, the oversaucing of chocolate and caramel to cover a kind of hockey-puckish little cake that reminded me of those easy-bake oven cakes. The raspberry puree on the side was the best part. \n\nSo I am sad to say, I have to take one star away for now. I will be foolish enough to give it one more try for dinner.... maybe it was an off day. :P\n\n\nMy husband and I went to this place to celebrate my birthday. Despite a good review by the AZ Republic (lol), we decided to try it. Wow, are we glad we did!! \n     The decor adds to a lovely ambiance - low lighting, a beautiful bar, and simple yet elegant table settings. There's a player piano, and conversation tables with overstuffed chairs. Our server, Jason, could not have been more gracious or attentive, even as the restaurant began to fill up. It was nice to be offered bottled, artisan water ($6), which was crisp, clean, and kept in a wine chiller at our table. As Phoenicians know, the local tap water here... yeah, not so much. I hate even asking for a glass of water, normally. \n     The menu appeared to be typical bistro fare, with artisan touches throughout. Each item includes a wine pairing, for those unsure. For those who take too freakin' long to decide (like us), Si the Wine Guy pops out of nowhere to give a knowledgable hand. The wine list has a nice selection, in price range as well as regions, and we were given excellent recommendations for the flight we each chose ($8-15 apiece; ours were $10). We started with an appetizer trio ($17), selecting the ahi tuna with caviar (a nice blend of delicate taste with the bold tuna); the prosciutto-wrapped melon, very nice, and then the crab-imperial stuffed mushroom, with creme fraiche and tomato-topped bruschetta. This last one was excellent, with a rich buttery crab filling. \n     My husband ordered the petite sirloin ($24), and I had the lamb ($26). His was very fresh, nearly fork-tender and cooked perfectly to order, with an understated but complimentary mushroom and spinach sort of ragout, and fingerling potatoes. My dish was tender with an incredible syrah reduction, just bold enough to match the thin-cut and perfectly cooked chops. It was on a bed of delicious mashed potatoes, with sauteed baby green beans and pepper slices- a little bit of heaven from the first bite to the last. \n     For dessert, the flourless chocolate cake with molten raspberry sauce ($8) sounded so tempting, but that will wait for our next visit. We shared the chilled fruit compote crepe ($8) instead, with creme fraiche on top. It was a perfectly light ending. \n     The portions were dead on- generous without being huge, which would have made the richness feel like overkill. After such a scrumpt-diddly-uptous meal, our bill seemed like a deal. \n     Tastings is a well-needed touch of class for the far West Valley, and an excellent value for what it offers.

In the meantime another woman and her friend also took up at a patio table nearby.\n\n20 minutes later the hostess/owner/manager looking woman came out and asked if we had been helped yet.  We said no and she left only to return with a small happy hour flier menu which she just handed from a distance and didn't even come over to our table.  I know you're wondering why I would wait the 15 minutes, but I really wanted to see just how bad the service was going to be and frankly, I just wanted some good $2 wine.\n\nIt's been about 5 minutes and the same woman comes back with full, detailed menus and I asked if the happy hour flier was the deals for the event and she said yes and then asked if we were ready to order.

I was excited to try some nice new wines on the cheap, but again... not so much.

I used my fork to slide it off the skewer and ended up getting a work out. This was way overcooked and way overseasoned. We had to put plenty of the sweet salsa on the chicken to balance out the amount of salt that was used for the chicken. So...not impressed with the satay.\n\nFor the entree we ordered the blackened salmon with risotto and veggies. They were out of risotto so we chose the goat cheese mashed potatoes instead. The salmon had a good flavor but was overcooked and the mashed potatoes were very good, even though I would have never knew that there was goat cheese in there. The server came over and told us that since we were sharing that if we wanted more veggies to let her know, my husband said sure I will have some. She ended up bringing out some weird stir fry veggies which did not come with the original meal ( we had steamed veggies) and we were charged $4 extra for these when the bill arrived. She really misled us, I thought she was OFFERING them. \n\nWe ordered the chocolate crepe with fresh fruit and creme fresh for desert ($8).The crepe was horrible in flavor and texture. The berries and creme that were inside were delicious.\n\nThe wine here is reasonable, and there are not many places in the westside that have this type of selection. i may go back for the wine...and that is it. The food did not impress me at all and I am so glad that the husband and I shared the plates we did get. This is usually what we do when we go for the first time to a place that is a little pricey. That way if the food is bad we do not spend so much. \n\nThis place may have some food that could be good, but I am not willing to take that chance. I would like to see a little more quality in the food here than what we received. I mean I have had better chicken satay at a backyard BBQ.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "Close to home for me!

The coffee was divine! And it was brought with real cream in a creamer! What a treat! We were off to a great start!\n\nThe menu was chock full of choices as well as the blackboard that lists specials, soup and mussels. My dining companion and I had a difficult time deciding what to order . . . I could have ordered at least a dozen items.  We agreed to share the eggplant tart as an hors d'oeuvre. The puff pastry was so delicate, abundantly filled with eggplant, spinach and mozzerella and lightly topped with tomato sauce.  Heavenly! It was large enough to have as an entree for one!  Both of us were drawn to the mac and cheese with crawfish and the grilled brie sandwich, but we both opted for the mac (one with crawfish, one without as my dining companion is allergic).  What came to our table was two huge dishes of creamy, lightly browned mac and cheese, enough for at least four people! They do not skimp on anything here! Let me say that other than a mac and cheese that I once had at BItrot d'a Cote in Paris, this was hands down the best I have ever had . . . the perfect amount of cheese to pasta, the ideal amount of chunks of crawfish . . . each forkful so heavenly. But after five sumptuous bites, I had to put my fork down and have it packed to go . . . I shared it with a couple of friends that I visited on my way home and saved just enough to bring home to my hubby, who savored each bite and said we have to go back for dinner . . . ASAP!\n\nWhile my friend and I lingered over the coffee, we couldn't help but notice that the restaurant was starting to fill up around 12:15 pm.

They had a great selection of wine, as well as an extensive drinks menu for your pleasure.

We just sampled two small plates but they were truly fabulous. My friend had the roasted beets. I generally do not like beets and usually force myself to eat them simply for the health benefits. These beets however were great. I would order and eat them and smile the whole time. I was shocked. I ordered a roasted stuffed poblano pepper that was perfectly cooked and had just the right amount of stuffing to sauce ratio. The sauce also had just enough kick without being too spicy. My only criticism of the food was portion size. For the price I would have expected 2 peppers instead of one. That being said I'm frugal these days and this place is trying to target a higher-end night life crowd. I spend my Saturday nights studying so clearly, that ain't me.\n\nI know a few more changes are in the works here as they polish the new concept but I think once people realize that they are now a wine bar too things will really take off.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Love Tertio!  \n\nSomewhere between Postino and Cheuvront lies Tertio, the newest wine bar in Phoenix.

After a couple minutes of looking lost we were told we could sit any where. A few minutes later I grabbed a couple menus from the counter to see what they had to offer. The waiter did finally show up did not offer any specials or really explain anything. Using a Living Social voucher we each got a glass of wine and a \"melt\" the wine was decent enough. The melt was well strange. It really was just a whole bunch of cheese melted on a doughy flat bread with a few pieces of sausage on it. We did order a couple of other food items as well. The other melt had pear and a balsamic reduction on it. This offered a bit more flavor and was decent enough. We were really looking forward to the baked avocados. Its an avocado split in half and filled with onions and corn and a few other non-descript items. The whole thing was rolled in panko and baked. Well it tasted like exactly what it was named: a baked avocado. No other flavor at all. In fact it was almost bizarre having that warm mushy avocado texture and not much else.

The 4-star average Yelp rating was the reason my wife and I chose to dine here during our stay in Phoenix. Yelp, you really let us down this time.\n\nSo I was on company business travel in Phoenix the week of March 12th and my wife was traveling with me. We had a French impulse that Tuesday night and tried to crash Petite Maison in Scottsdale, only to find out that reservations were required and there were no tables available. The following night, still craving French cuisine, we decided to stop in at Sophie's French Bistro in Phoenix.\n\nThe first warning sign was that the place was entirely empty during peak dinner hours. However, encouraged by the strong reviews on Yelp, we decided to go ahead and order. We took advantage of a couple of happy hour specials and ordered the following...\n\n3 Cheese Plate\nChef's Pate\nCalamari\nCrispy Duck Breast\nCreme Brulee\n\nThe food was average at best. My wife and I both tend to critique food as we eat it, and we both found ourselves commenting that the portions were small and the food was overpriced for what it was. Most of what we ate was bland and the pate had a very odd flavor and consistency.\n\nThe fun started about 4 hours later when we were back in our hotel room. We both started experiencing various internal moaning and groaning, followed by the onset of stomach pain. No big deal, I thought... \n\nBy shortly after midnight, we were each fighting for time in the bathroom, taking turns to vomit up everything we had eaten that night. I'll try to spare you the details, but this was the kind of violent and uncontrollable vomiting that I have only experienced perhaps once before in my entire life. Needless to say, diarrhea was also involved.\n\nAfter going through this for a good two hours, my wife and I were both thoroughly exhausted and dehydrated. My wife even told me she felt like she was dying, and said that she had never felt this bad before - not even during child birth. o.O\n\nSo by around 2:30am, my wife was begging for me to call an ambulance. For a while, neither of us could get up off the floor to reach the telephone. I eventually found a break in the vomiting and managed to sip down enough water to recover slightly. I carried my wife out to the car and asked the hotel receptionist for directions to the nearest hospital.\n\nWe drove to John C. Lincoln Hospital on Dunlap, which I recommend if you ever get poisoned by Sophie's French Bistro. I managed to get there without hitting anything, which was remarkable since I could barely see straight and could barely function at all. \n\nOnce inside, my wife completely collapsed and was unconscious briefly. The nurses and doctors rushed her into the ER and brought her back around. They gave her a shot of morphine and then hooked her up to an IV drip of fluids. As I waited, I continued to experience vomiting and tried to keep myself hydrated. Despite being in a hospital, I was determined not to check myself in for treatment, not wanting to add further medical bills.\n\nSometime around 5:00am, my wife was ready to be discharged. The official diagnosis was acute food poisoning. We were never able to identify the specific meal at Sophie's which poisoned us, as we both shared the same courses and ate equal amounts each.\n\nHowever - and this is the kicker - when the doctors asked us where we had eaten dinner and we told them it was Sophie's, they remarked \"oh, that place!\". We learned that the ER at John C. Lincoln has seen 3 other cases of food poisoning caused by Sophie's. The hospital took our information for the purpose of compiling a complaint against Sophie's with the AZ Department of Health Services. They told us that once they have at least 10 confirmed cases, then they are required by law to report the incident as a disease outbreak.\n\nThis all would have been nice to know before we chose to dine at this place. I can only assume that the other poisoning victims either don't use the internet, or are still laying in a pool of vomit somewhere, too weak to write a review.\n\nPlease, please, PLEASE don't put yourself through the same hell that we went through that night. After this experience, we lost all desire to dine in Phoenix ever again. Thanks, Sophie's, for ruining our trip.\n\nFor the record, we did have an excellent meal at CIBO Pizza the night before we were poisoned. I highly recommend CIBO.

We first started upstairs. The ceilidh hall or, as I call it, the Medieval Jam House, where after parting with the required \u00a33 entry, we were greeted with the bustling populace and the cheesiest of cheesy live bands. Cheesier than a Kingsize Happy Meal. So cheesy they made Aqua look credible. You get the gist. I've been told on occasion there will are ceilidhs instead of the band, so sounds like I got there on a GOOD night...!\n\nIn fairness, the clientele did make the hall more bearable. A spacious bar area meant less heaving crowds and more social space. Tables a bit crammed together meant it was difficult to manoeuvre in between but the outskirts were fine. And I suppose the band would be tolerable if you were into that kinda thing... or were completely sozzled!\n\nI, however, was not and so sought something more downstairs... and found it.\n\nPerhaps one of the best social bars in Edinburgh. Definitely worth a look. The music was also live, but an acoustic set of rock and indie classics (gotta hand it to young male guitarists in the area... they have no idea what cheese is!) that wasn't overpowering, so there was no struggle to make yourself heard. The space was immense, enough tables and chairs not to let the floor become overcrowded and enough standing room even if all seats were taken, therefore no barging to and from the bar.\n\nThe atmosphere lively, an even ratio of male to female (probably the only bar I can think of in recent weeks where this was the case), a good standard of customer (ie. no chavs, ponces, et al) and attentive bar staff. Didn't notice much price difference between here and anywhere else around the town centre, and no idea if they serve food.\n\nAll in all a well-maintained, clean and chav-free bar with a busy, lively and albeit cheesy club atmosphere above.

First off, as Joe A has so eloquently put it, the medieval doors, building and massively impressive interior just lend it an air of regality and grandeur. That is, until you get bumped into by a slightly inebriated, stilleto-wearing lush spilling a bit of g&t on you. \n\nIt's that juxtaposition of amazing venue, gorgeous interior, and its main purpose being to house a large group of Edinburgh drinkers, movers and shakers resulting in a sticky, broken-glass covered hall. I mean, in honesty, if we're going with the medieval theme here the chaos and general debauchery is quite fitting if the books / shows / movies I've seen are anything to go by. But the romantic in me winces a little when I climb the large, spiraling, circular stair-case up to the Great Hall, complete with medieval long benches, pews, cavernous ceiling only to have to endure a few hours worth of nose-bleed enducing bad music.\n\nGosh I sound bitter. It's Monday morning, it's cold and wet. Bare with me. I came here on Saturday night with a group of yelpers post dinner-party and we were all in awesomly high spirits. We know how to bring the banter. Climbing up the stairs to the Great Hall with Joe A again exclaiming his love of all things medieval and quoting \"Winter is coming, to Winterfell!\" the music coming from the room sounded good. Live band, Jurgen D immediately started me off on an improv lindy-hop, the crowd were good, no hassle, no jostling, people enjoying the music.\n\nTwo songs in, around 1am, and it stopped. Then the DJ came on and played the worst mix of gash pop I've heard in a while. I actually like pop (as my iPhone playlist earlier that evening attested). Pop you can dance to, yes. But rather than slowing moving into the crap-pop DJs reserve for half an hour before close, to subconsciously move people along anyway and kill the night before it's dead, he launched straight into tunes that no one wanted to, or could, dance to. Looking around everyone had the same look of a bored attempt at fun on their faces. Apart from the g&t lushes.\n\nSo we wandered downstairs and had a drink at the bar. It's a nice big bar. There's loads of space to sit. In fact, I am perhaps being too harsh in my 3 star rating, as we had no hassle, the crowd were good, bouncers good, staff pleasant, not to expensive.

I enjoyed the veges and the sauce, and the salmon itself was just OK; could have done with a splash of lemon juice or something.  For dessert, my flatmates just ordered ice-cream, but I ordered the vanilla and chocolate cheesecake with berry compote.  When it arrived, it was 2 big triangles, so a substantial helping.  However the chocolate part of the cheesecake was obviously white chocolate, which I would not have ordered if it had said that on the menu as you would expect!

Besides its first-rate menu, the theatrical decor,  with its Renaissance colors, and the engaging drama of the place, with its subtle lighting and joyful sounds, kept us, and many others, coming back.  Now relocated to Fitchburg, the Veranda carries on the tradition of the Caf\u00e9 Continental and the high culinary values of the Schiavo family.\n\nBrunch on the weekend is when we typically have chosen to come. The Veranda benedict, boasting the best ingredients, features asparagus and prosciutto or beef tenderloin and Bavaria smoked bacon with an addictive Hollandaise sauce.  Included with the order is Rose Marie's recipe for a warm, creamy potato side dish.  The Benedicts alone are worth the trek to the suburbs.\n\nAlternate selections include a similar array of omelettes, French toast or pancakes.  Also on the menu is a rich array of fresh oysters as well as mussels and clams--devilishly good in a Chablis and garlic butter sauce.  Specialty items include Rose Marie's original spiedini, besides other selections we have yet to try.  \n\nThen there are the many freshly made pasta dishes (the pappardelle pasta with shrimp and wild-caught scallops bathed in a buttery cream sauce is splendid), sandwiches-my favorite is the grilled chili-ginger marinated tilapia and my husband's the curry chicken with dried cranberries and romaine lettuce served on a toasted ciabatta) and then the salads (an old reliable for me is the Veranda Caesar salad with grilled chicken, shaved cheese and croutons.   Irresistible on a cold day (a hot one as well!) is the mushroom soup which is velvety and delicious, the slices of bread accompanying it, and other dishes, are marvelously fresh and warm.  \n\nThe deserts are original and appealing.  Famed Babcock Hall espresso ice cream with little chunks of truffle based on a Veranda-inspired formula anyone?.  A taste of the afterlife, to be sure!\n\nThe outdoor \" verandah,\" with its bower of shadowing trees, hanging baskets bursting with red flowers and fluttering canopy umbrellas, seems ideal for a home-made lemonade or any one of a number of stronger spirits from behind the fully-stocked (nifty zinc counter) bar.  Savor a glass of fine cabernet or pinot grigio from the luxury of options on the bar's wine list.   On a late afternoon, add to this  an appetizer of caponata bruschetta or fried calamari with a lemon garlic aioli.  \n\nMany of the loved recipes which were appreciated by the hundreds of patrons who made the Caf\u00e9 Continental their restaurant of choice have returned.  Abundant portions of the best in quality of pasta, steak, seafood and greens are proudly served. \n\nThe interior of the restaurant is warm, embracing and truly \"continental\", a honeycomb arrangement of rooms perfect for special events.  One feels special, a part of the family, greeted the moment one arrives by the hostess, who brightens the experience, then offers a comfortable booth or table.  Staff are friendly and engaging.  The premises are immaculately clean.  \n\nOnce you begin going out to the Veranda, the distance seems not so far and this fine ultimate destination actually seems very near.

We went for lunch for Restaurant Week, and it was really pretty meh.\n\nStarted with the smoked salmon on crostini--definitely the highlight of the meal. The smoked salmon was done in-house and seasoned well. Really good. The greens that came with it, though, were oily and overdressed. Points off.\n\nFor the entree, all three of us got the short ribs--they were really, really mediocre. I mean...just not that good. The pieces were overly fatty (so much so that there wasn't much meat on them), there was a bizarre, hoisin-like sauce on top and then a random piece of parsley (maybe cilantro?). Honestly, the dish came across as confused. The mixed rice told me they were going for Asian inspiration, but the flavors just didn't really work. What meat was actually on the short ribs was good, but didn't stand out.\n\nDessert was profiteroles--the ice cream was absolutely delicious, but let's be realistic--everything that comes from Babcock Hall is delicious. Profiteroles were good, but nothing special. Whipped cream wasn't as thick as it should've been, and was really falling apart.\n\nI debated giving them 2 stars, but the salmon was truly great, as was the service. As for whether I'd go back?

Someone else took our plates and we sat there with no drinks and no food for around 30 minutes.  My wife wanted dessert, but was getting really annoyed at the actions of the waiter.  FINALLY, he came by and said \"Is there a birthday here??\" bringing a piece of cake.  He didn't seem to know whose birthday it was and he didn't give us the option to look at a dessert menu.  Yes, the slice of cake was free, but my wife didn't like it and would have happily paid for something she did enjoy.

I am falling in love with this commecial center's 'restaurant row' each time we go, as I find it a much needed escape from our natural desert landscape (the desert has it's beauty, but the life that flourishes in and amongst this artificial oasis is a refreshing change). The beautiful weather this time of year certainly makes this particular outdoor eatery more appealing, but the food makes it worthy of a return no matter the season.\n\nAlthough I have eaten at Marche Bacchus a handful of times within the past few years, I hadn't been back recently because the old chef seemed to let things slip. The new chef, however, has revived this hot spot for traditional French cuisine, and a decorator has stepped in and made the cafe/wine store into a place you can easily spend a few hours in. Since this location is becoming a popular place to host weddings, today we tried something old and something new, something cold and something, well, pink.\n\nThere were actually two something olds, the french onion soup ($8) and the moulles frites (steamed mussels with fries, $15). The French onion soup was served traditionally in a brown and white clay bowl textured by crisp gruyere baked around its edges. The veal stock was rich and seemed salty at first, but as the soup began to cool from its bubbling state the flavors emerged revealing a layer of acidity we intially mistook for overseasoning. It was definitely one of those dishes that gets better and better the more you eat. Sadly, however, the moules weren't as impressive. Although the mussels were cooked well, the broth was weak and didn't coat them enough to give any additional flavor. It was served in the appropriate cast iron vessel, but this pot was really too small to allow you to get the liquid in each bite. The frittes on the other hand were teriffic, but I would have preferred a traditional aoli as an accompaniment rather than plain old American ketchup.\n\nThe something cold was the Lobster Avocado Croissant ($12), which was incredibly difficult to find any fault with. The buttery and golden brown croissant was light (can light be used to describe a croissant?), but despite this was not overpowered by the lobster filling. There is no mayonnaise used in the salad, according to the waiter, making the dish all the more impressive as there is a definite creaminess to it. The salad was composed of big chunks of lobster bound by less desirable (yet still tasty) knuckle meat enhanced with crunchy, finely chopped celery and shallots. It was served with a delicately dressed salad that upped the fresh factor and colored the plate.\n\nThe something new was the sake Bloody Mary ($9.50) Ian had, which rivaled that of Hash House for the best in town (note: they don't use vodka at March Bacchus because they only have a wine and beer license). This one doesn't have the jalapeno stuffed olives and tangy cornichons, but it does contain an ample amount of real horseradish that gives an unexpected punch, differing greatly from the usual tobasco and black pepper that give heat to most (think spiked cocktail sauce). The something pink was my Kir Royale ($8) which was a relative bargain but a touch on the sweet side for my taste. It didn't matter though, becuase the color looked so beautiful in contrast to the background of blue sky and green palm fronds (see below).\n\nTo top off the lovely meal, the service was wonderful. Our waiter even brought over a heat lamp to combat the mild, cool breeze without us having to ask. I could have done without the artificial strand of sunflowers that wrapped the bridge, but I guess the whole scene is fairly artificial so it didn't bother me too much. The ambiance actually adds tremendously to the meal, because despite the faux flowers and what not, you are surrounded by running water, several turtles, large carp, and a beautiful black swan.

Parking was not a problem at that hour as it was 9:00 p.m. Walking along the parking lot to the entrance gave me a serene, quiet feeling, with no one else in sight but a few cars parked on the vicinity of this plaza of other businesses. The doors open to a receptionist/cashier desk to my left and all throughout is where the wine market shop is. Rows and rows of wine can be seen, some laid out on oak barrels and other wine bins. I was informed that the bistro and wine shop closes at 9:30 p.m. Nevertheless, my friend and I can still dine even after its closing time which is 9:30 p.m. As I was there first, I roamed a little around the wine \"market\" and saw the cozy indoor dining area of the bistro to the far right. I finally walked away from the wine bins to a doorway leading to table seating on the patio. I was \"enticed\" by the music coming from a guitarist who was playing sweet jazz music that have overtones of samba and latin rhythm by the patio door as I walked in the patio area, thus, setting my mood to a romantic, calm dining night. The patio overlooks the Lake Jacqueline. On a moonlit night it sparked the love fires in me as I sat on a table next to a fireplace. Tables were set on various angles, quite nice! One dining area had curtains set on poles flowing onto the patio floor. I gazed out to the lake...c'est magnifique! The moon reflects so beautifully on the lake's serene, calm waters.

My husband had gone there a week earlier to make the reservation, to be sure of getting a table by the lake.  The reservation was for 7:30, but I was running late, as usual.  He called and asked if we could change it for 8:00.  \"Sure, just don't be late.\"\n\nWe were five minutes early.  The hostess informed us that it would be \"just a few minutes.\"  So we waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.  After about 20 minutes, and being told it would be \"very soon,\" we were offered a really crummy table. We declined. Jeff, the owner - who's now famous after being on Pawn Stars as the \"wine expert\" -  helped us choose what turned out to be the perfect bottle of Riesling, and it sat on a table inside, waiting along with us, getting as warm as we were getting hot under the collar.\n\nWendy, Jeff's wife, was very friendly and solicitous.  She said she had the perfect table picked out for us, but the foursome, who had long finished eating, drinking, and paying their bill, just wouldn't leave.  She didn't want to be rude and incur their wrath and ask them to leave.  Wendy did offer us a glass of champagne while we waited, but we turned it down, since we'd be drinking that bottle of wine.  And so we continued to wait.  After very nearly an hour, and after I'd told Wendy that my patience was wearing thin and that my birthday celebration was being ruined, she got the brilliant idea to offer THEM a glass of champagne at the bar if they'd relinquish their table.  They got up immediately, and I never did find out if they had that drink.\n\nThe table was great - spacious, since we were two at a table for four - and right next to the lake.  This was the dimmer part of the patio, which suited us fine - we thought the upper part was too brightly lit.  But of course I couldn't see the ducks very well.  Oh well, I wasn't planning to have duck, anyway.\n\nOur server, Jason (I think), was perfectly competent, though not overly friendly.  We ordered the warm spinach salad, and he had the kitchen split it for us.  It was super, but turned out not really big enough to share.\n\nI had the trout, and it ranked up there with some of the best I've ever had.  Sometimes filet of trout has bones, and this baby had not a single one.  It was topped with a balsamic drizzle, some crabmeat, and a few leaves of fresh spinach.  It was a good-sized portion, and the half I took home tasted as delicious the next night.\n\nMy husband had the petite filet mignon.  He liked it, but when I tasted it I thought it could have been more tender.  I also found the pomme frites perfectly ordinary, just a notch above Mickey D's.\n\nWhat really irked me was that after our long, long wait, I thought we should have been comped a dessert, only because Wendy knew it was my birthday and that it was close to being ruined.

There was a mixup in the kitchen that resulted in our entrees being served roughly ten minutes apart. Not a great impression. What was great was that they apologized, took full responsibility, and asked what they could do to make it better.

When the bread pudding came out, there was a side of cinnamon apple sauce that went quite well with the bread pudding. I must add that the bread pudding was not as moist as bread puddings should normally be. Bread pudding was traditionally made with left-over bread and needed to be moist because it was supposed to be drenched in custard as that would help the bread soften. Of course, it was still very yummy. \n\nLast year, I also had their charcuterie. From what I recall, the charcuterie had a very nice mix of pear, apple, candied walnuts, and different cheeses and thinly sliced meats. My eyes couldn't help but glance over to the 11-top next to me when the platters of fromage came to their table. There were apricots, pickles, cheeses, and slices of apples on their plates. Everything looked really delicious, even as I was ready to leave. \n\nI am excited about my next visit to March\u00e9 Bacchus and hope it won't be another year before I come back.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "It was December and we ate outside on the heated patio.

I got friends visiting in town from Cali. We all loved french bistro, so we went to Comme \u00c7a, Mon Ami Gobi for the first two nights and decided to try something different off the strip. I read lots good review about this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. It took us almost 40 mins from Henderson to Summerlin. First impression of this place to me was really nice. We all loved the outdoor patio seating area with some kind of view of lake. Our waitress was friendly and menu price was quiet good compared to strip price. We ordered saffron seafood bisque and escargots persillad for appetizers, Poulet Frites, kobe beef hot-dog for entrees, CR\u00c8ME BRULEE A LA VANILLE, and GRAND MARNIER CHOCOLATE CAKE for deserts. The only dish I liked was saffron seafood bisque. Kobe beef hot-dog tasted nothing special to me. The sauce of my pan seared chicken breast was tasty but chicken skin was way too salty. All the french fries came with entrees were really salty. you could see sea salt all over the fries and plate!! And dish disappointed me the most was escargot. Escargot is always on my must order list whenever I dine in french restaurants. This is WORST ESCARGOT I ever tasted in my life!!!! I tasted one bite and asked waitress to bring back to kitchen. I asked waitress to ask chef to try the dish and see how chef thinks. Our waitress replied chef said this is exactly how we serve this dish everyday. Really!!!!!!? well, if this is true, then I have to repeat what I just said earlier \" This is WORST ESCARGOT I ever tasted in my life!!!!\" I wonder if there was any kitchen staff spilled salt bottle located next to our escargots and fries!! I am not a complainer if you read all my other reviews on yelp. I am actually very generously with giving stars. But the reply from chef was really making me upset. In the end, manager took off one saffron soup and escargot from our check without lots apologies. Our waitress was a nice lady. She did feel bad that we didn't enjoy our meal. At least she showed she cared on her face not like the manager.

She seemed annoyed that we had a large group and she didn't ask to refill half of the groups drinks, took over 30 minutes just to ask what we wanted to order, drinks and food.

There must be something about the ability to pronounce the food and wine so much better than their patrons that makes the waiters and managers so pompous.  Yet March\u00e9 Bacchus' food and wine do not justify the how utterly inconsiderate was the staff.\n\nTucked behind a wine shop on the beachhead of a very artificial lake, the restaurant is actually quite quaint with its mini gazebos and picturesque view.  Nature has been harnessed and brought tableside.  But the table layout certainly feels fun and romantic.  \n\nWines by the glass are quite pricey.  You might as well reach to the \"reserve\" side of the menu for just a few dollars more.  The Rhone wines on the reserve list were very nice but nothing that quite justified the cost.  Others we tried throughout the night were all good but not great.  To me, the Frank's Family Cabernet may be the only wine worth its weight.\n\nThe escargot was wonderfully soft and had a surprising finish of citrus.  The foie gras was very nice and lighter than expected.  The charcuterie was fun and represented the last thing we would truly enjoy.  For the kitchen ran out of duck confit on this Sunday night.  The duck breast was so atrociously salty it made me think of flash fried spam.  And the tenderloin was overly salted and overcooked.  Thankfully, its wine reduction gravy saved the dish from being sent back.\n\nInconsiderate is the best way I can sum up the service we experienced.  The waiter did not listen.  He ran away from our table even when we yelled to him to bring him back.  Our requests went unfilled just as our water glasses went unfilled.  When one wine was no longer available, the manager himself brought out a completely different varietal (Shiraz, which many including myself find repulsive).  Without bothering to ask what other wine we would prefer at nearly $16 a glass, the manager just assumed that we would accept his subjective palate and judgment in lieu of our own as to which wine we would find most pleasing.  He plunked down the Shiraz and dallied away as if everything were wonderful.  Later, the waiter could not confirm whether the Shiraz I was given was the expensive Shiraz on the menu or some cheap substitute, so I naturally assumed it was the latter.  We sent back the Shiraz in lieu of another varietal and then reminded the staff that we had also asked three to four times for yet a different glass of wine for another guest in our party.  The manager again assumed that his foreign charm would make all amends, until we finally had to make clear by yelling in unison that there were still two outstanding wine orders that had not been fulfilled.  We then still had to remind the staff another three times for the wine, and finally received it at a freezing temperature.  The staff then disappeared altogether by the time we had begun our meals and we wanted to order a bottle of the freezing wine.   Needless to say, we left quite sober and thirsty from having neither enough wine nor water.\n\nThe denouement was the attempt to sort out the dinner coupon.  Aside from the comedy of errors that ensued in processing the coupon, the staff had the audacity to foist an 18% gratuity on our party of four.  Mon dieu!\n\nWe absolutely expect better from a restaurant that is supposed to know about fine wine and fine dining.

The pat\u00e9 appetizer is long gone, replaced by a $16 charcuterie plate with less food on it. The cheese plate at $17 is ridiculously small. The delicious fresh-baked baguette has been replaced by some indifferently warmed ciabatta rolls, for some damn reason (you're a French restaurant! serve French bread!). The burger comes out at the right temperature now, but the price is up to $15. And the last time I ordered the steak frites, I got about three little medallions of steak and a whole pile of frites. Where'd the steak go? Oh, it's over on the dinner menu and it costs twice as much. Okay.\n\nTo me, dinner seems like lunch, only more so. But i don't usually go for dinner so I'll keep my mouth shut about that.\n\nA long time ago MB was a wine store that also made pretty good sandwiches. The ambiance was garbage and the staff (all one of them!) were surly but the view off the back patio was nice. Then the place changed ownership and things improved steadily for a while until they had a real, properly equipped restaurant with a full menu of reasonably priced, hearty, delicious dishes. These are the times I'm remembering so fondly in the text above. Not even two years ago, I would have recommended Marche Bacchus to any and everyone (and I did). But these days it's trying to be a hoity-toity, tiny-portion, haute-cuisine restaurant, and it's not quite succeeding. \n\nI have no problem paying a lot for a small portion if the quality is there. I \"get\" fine dining, okay? I have zero problems dropping money on a nice meal. My problem with MB is that the prices have gone up, the portions have shrunk down, and the actual food hasn't improved all that significantly. Yeah, they can cook beef to temp now. But they're a restaurant. If you can't cook beef to temp, you got problems, yo.\n\nThe folks at Marche Bacchus have a lot going for them. They have a wonderful wine selection, a great location, and loyal customers. But they need to take a step back and try to remember what made them so well-loved to begin with, then try to do that again. Because they aren't doing it now, and it's sad. It's a classic case of a restaurant that's bought into its own hype and stopped paying attention to what really matters.\n\nIt's still not a bad place to eat lunch. Especially if someone else is picking up the check.\n\ne: Upon further consideration I'm dropping my rating to two stars after reading some of the people under me.

I've had this place bookmarked for forever and it seemed like a good fit for us since we wanted something low-key and didn't want anything on the strip. I made reservations a couple weeks ago and requested a table right along the edge right by the water which is the only reason I chose this restaurant...I've worked in food and beverage so I know requests can't be guaranteed but they are still possible to grant with proper planning and especially if it is for a special occasion. \nWhen we got to the restaurant the hostess had 0 personality. Not even a smile, a welcome, a how are you, happy anniversary..nothing.. just borderline rudeness! I don't know if she was new but she seemed a little flustered. At that point a server came around and angrily asked her why she would seat a 6 top party with no menus.. and she mumbled something back.. IDK it was just a really weird start to the night and a bad first impression of the restaurant. \n\nWe waited for 10 minutes or so for our table which was not a problem since you can kill time by looking around at their wine selection. \nWe got seated and I was NOT happy with our table. It was small  and not to mention the farthest table from the lake on the patio. I had a view but my boyfriend didn't have any. UGH. Then looking at my menu I realized they gave me a brunch menu.. no one came to greet us or even fill our water glasses for 10 minutes. At this point I just wanted to leave... but my boyfriend was getting hungry and said we should just wait it out. Someone finally brought us water.. I asked the guy for a dinner menu and he never brought me one.. Then 15 minutes into us being seated I see 2 tables right by the lake finish and leave. If the hostess knew what the hell she was doing she would have had us wait at the bar so we could have been seated at the table I requested. But what ever.. at this point I just needed some wine badly. \nFinally our server came and took our orders. Apparently she had been there since noon which I had heard some other servers say too. So they are understaffed and most of their servers are tired. Our server was nice but half way through the meal I stopped seeing her so I'm assuming she left for the night... would have been nice if she told us she was leaving. \n\nThe food was just OK here.. not bad but not amazing..if this food was being served at a restaurant that didn't have a view of a lake then I'm sure it wouldn't be doing as well. We ordered:\n\n-Bacchus Cheese & Charcuterie platter ($21) When the food runner dropped this off she started to tell us what was on it and then she stopped and said she forgot.. LOL wow it would have been nice to know what the hell we were eating but oh well.. It was nice to graze on with our wine.\n-Bread: Their bread basket was just some warm sliced ciabatta bread.. \n-Steak Frittes ($25) Decent steak with really crispy fries..\n-Crispy Maple Leaf Duck Breast ($30) It was good but I would have liked a more sweet glaze to go with it.. \n-In House Wine: You can just select a wine from the front store and bring it to your table and the server will add it on to the bill.. They charge $10 to whatever the retail price is.. Wines start at $15 ($25 in the restaurant)\n-Corkage fee: If you want to bring in your own bottle of wine there is a $25 fee\n\nI find it really funny that after they brought the bill to the table and after they ran my card they asked if we wanted dessert.. LOL \n\nIn the end, I had an enjoyable night because I was with the man I love and the live flamenco player was a nice touch too.. but it also could have been due to the fact that we finished 2 bottles of wine so I was feeling good. but MAN Service I think is half of the experience of dining at a restaurant and this place sucked booooty in that department. If the service was good I would give Marche Bacchus 4 stars but it was just so BAD...I really am tempted to give it another go for brunch but I don't want to have to guzzle down 2 bottles of wine again just to enjoy my meal. \n\nHOT TIP: I have none.

I watched the Manager pour champagne into my daughter's glass, get champagne all over as he did not know how to properly pour(this is the same Manager that told his staff not to serve bread to their guests as it was only Brunch!) Our bus person found that absolutely absurd as we did and gladly brought us bread while we waited. Timing was an issue all around us and other guests could be overheard grumbling about the lack of service and inferior food  guality.

Twice a porter came to refill waters and then walked off with several of the glasses still empty- never to return with more water! We asked for our checks in the middle of the meal because we could foresee it being a looooooong wait, and unfortunately we were right.\nWhen the manager came over to ask how everything was, my friend mentioned that the service was really, really slow. He seemed surprised and eventually told us that it was because we needed separate checks. When we (nicely!) let him know that every aspect of the service had been slow, not just the check-getting portion, he mentioned the separate checks again and blamed our wait on an outdated computer system. When he came back 15 minutes later to find us still waiting he told us he had comped our bottomless mimosas due to the wait - which was nice of him! Only...none of us had had bottomless mimosas ($20), although 4 of the 8 had had single mimosas ($8). We all said thank goodness that we had ordered the singles, because I can't imagine how long we would have waited for a refill on the bottomless ones. \nI do understand that separate checks are not ideal (when I organize a group outing elsewhere in the future I will definitely remind everyone about bringing cash) but they can't treat separate checks like some sort of puzzling phenomenon that has never been encountered before.

Actually, their prices for what you get are pretty good. I got their Steak & Eggs, which is also served with some home fries. The steak was the highlight. I would guess about 6 oz of well seasoned, well prepared, and thinly sliced steak.  Normally steak & eggs come a little dry. Not here, their steak was juicy and delicious.

The food was good but not outstanding.\n\nCaesar's Salad: Take it--very good but an expected rendition.\n\nSteak Tartare:  Leave it--enjoyable, but the meat had tough spots and the quantity of capers overpower the mild beef.  The meat was too mild to hold up to the overwhelming capers.  Even the poached egg yoke and buttered toast was overpowered the meat.  The salted shallots to the side was the right compliment to the tartar.\n\nMaple Leaf Duck:  Leave it--There were tough veins in the duck but tender portions, too.  It was cooked perfectly.  Yet, it didn't really have flavors that enticed my taste buds.  The quince was a nice touch but didn't enhance the game.  The other side flavors were non descript.\n\nRoasted Chicken:  Take it--clearly the best dish we tried here.  Chicken sounds boring but it was much better than the duck.  The seasoning was subtle but done well.  The Spaetzle was enhanced with an herb reduction, which is more German than French, but who cares because it had an abundance of flavors that complimented the chicken.  We both thought this dish was extremely well executed.\n\nSides:  we only ordered the Mac and Cheese.  I hate mac and cheese but with the Gruyere (a type of Swiss cheese) they put in it, it was excellent (it has black truffles, too, but there is no way truffle is going to sneak through the Gruyere).  The cream of this side overpowered the duck but who cares, it was good.  Just don't order the duck.\n\nWine:  selecting a bottle of the wine in the store and then drinking it at the table was a novelty.  However, the prices are well over retail and the descriptions are a bit deceptive at times.  Look at the review next to the wine and it might have a 90+ rating.

Well, the way the musician of the evening sung, he is.  And all the other great 80's music as well.  The live music was enjoyable but the uniqueness of dining on the water, with the moon dangling just under the patio, this is what one comes to Marche Bacchus for.\n\nDon't bring a generic gift card; they won't be able to get it to work.

Clearly a menu designed with wine in mind but not particularly wanting to imbibe so early in the day it was instead the food that brought me to Bacchus, specifically the house charcuterie program and as such selecting the Bacchus platter along with an order of the house foie gras would be the order of the day, a lovely arrangement that paired beautifully with not only the warm house bread but also the weather, sun, water, ducks and turtles passing by.  From appropriately funky rillettes to spicy chorizo and a hearty pork pate each item on the charcuterie platter was excellent while the foie gras itself was delicate and creamy with all its characteristic sapor despite the surprisingly flavorless and liquidy gelee - a situation remedied quickly with a request for more quince.  Moving on to dessert, and actually a difficult choice amongst a pair of my favorites I eventually went with my instincts and selected the bread pudding, a delicate cloud that seemed to be made of angel food cake with ample house whipped cream and a sidecar of intense rum sauce spiked with cinnamon.

It was packed with flavor and really was yum-tastic.  \n\nI went with the classic Steak Frites, because it is really one of my go to entrees.

The floor around us had some broken glass as well.  It seems to have been missed during a clean up effort, but we could easily see it.  There was also several tables wide open for the entire time we were there right next to the water.  I guess we weren't special enough for those seats.\n\n2. The servers were all super nice, but stretched thin.  When we had our server, she was awesome.  The problem was we had to wait long periods in-between visits because she was so busy.  I don't mind a leisurely dinner, but this was a bit extreme.

I've been coming here for years and I know that it is a hit or miss most of the time. It was packed, which is fine, they were setting up for large parties, but we were severely neglected (even though we were one of like 7 tables seated). Our server looked like she was having the WORST day of her life, and I don't resent her for it, who know what's what. \n\nWe ordered Bloody Marys, which were basically shrimp cocktail sauce in a glass. I get using some horseradish in the mix, but the consistency and the flavor intensity was just straight up cocktail sauce. So disappointing because my man and I came a little hungover and were really looking forward to it. My pet peeve in restaurants is when stuff is sent out without anyone checking the food or doing a drink taste test. UGH!!! \n\nI had a french onion soup. It came with a large crouton with cheese on top of it. It was extremely inconvenient to eat, I was struggling with that big chunk of bread, glued to the cheese for a while. Tasty though. I'd really recommend dropping a piece of toasted bread in the soup and baking the cheese over the bowl, it's what French Onion Soup is ALL about, the cheese factor! I mean Google the thing for F sake and you will see many amazing ways of presenting this awesome dish! \n\nThe bf had a blue cheese burger. He eats red meat like once in a year and was looking forward to it. Medium rare.... came out well done, extra dry and there was a very conservative drop of blue cheese on there. Meh. \n\nI had a turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce. First bite was like biting into smelly fish. The turkey was completely spoiled. I thought it was just me (because of the night before), the bf did a taste test and we sent it back. There was no significant reaction from the server, like AT ALL. And 20 min later she comes by and says \"I'll take that off the bill for ya okaaay?\" Like she was doing us a favor. We both looked at her and said \"uhh... yeah, you will!\" \n\nWe noticed other patrons sending food back and the owner did absolutely nothing about coming over and talking to the guests or making apologies. Every time I see him, he just strikes me as a huge huge douche. And knowing this place (and many people who have worked here) he is and so is his wife. No wonder there is no enthusiasm in this place and why their employee turnover is so high. Shame.\n\nDo yourself a favor, skip lunch and have a dinner here. Service will always be total sh*t, but it's great atmosphere for you and your love and if you stick to perhaps the cheese plate, the muscles and other simpler items, you will not be disappointed.", "review_stars": 1, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 3, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "This is one of my Las Vegas Favorites!!!

I love fine dining but don't consider myself a 'foodie' or food snob ... it's just something that I enjoy. I have heard from a coworker as well as a couple of customers about how awesome this place is. Among the accolades were the food, the incredible wine selection in the on-site wine store and that it feels like you've actually left town when you dine there. \nLast week, I finally took the time to make the trip and found it peacefully tucked away in an adorable little Summerlin community. Upon parking and approaching the building, I immediately thought that I might be in the wrong place. It is in a strip plaza and from the outside, does not appear to be a restaurant and seems too small to accommodate many diners. The front doors slid open and we were very warmly welcomed by a hostess who asked us if we were dining with them this evening. We stated that we were indeed and offered our last name for the reservation, I in turn asked for her name. She smiled and introduced herself as Tracy. She was aware that it was our initial visit to the establishment (we booked through Open Table which relays that we were first time diners) and explained how things work. You can either enjoy wine by the glass, which allows the opportunity for variety or you can choose bottles from the store and take them to your table to be served to you before, during and after your meal. If the latter is your choice, there is a $10 corking fee per bottle which is extremely reasonable. She then asked if we would like some time to peruse the store or if we preferred to be seated first. Since I had heard so much about the ambiance, I was eager to see the terrace and opted to be seated directly. She promptly collected menus and asked if we preferred to dine inside or outside to which I almost too eagerly responded \"Definitely outside please\". She smiled and guided us through the store, pointed out a quaint cozy indoor dining room to the right and stated that if we were too hot or became uncomfortable for any reason outside, we could transfer indoors ... and finally out onto the terrace. As we walked through the door, I felt like I had stepped into a different world. The terrace is breathtaking! She showed us to a table overlooking the lake through open wall sized glass windows. My husband and I exchanged very pleased smiles. She informed us that Marty would be our waiter and would be right with us. [When we were enjoying our meal, she sat another couple near us and stopped by to check on us. I was very impressed by this as hostesses rarely interact with guests except upon arrival and departure. Nice touch!]\nMarty appeared almost instantly and offered our water selections, went over the soup du jour as well as the dinner specials. He is warm, personable, jovial, attentive and informative. We enjoyed his service very much. We each ordered a glass of wine while reviewing the menu. Once we had ordered our appetizer, we went inside to look over the bottle selection. The prices are very reasonable and the selection is quite impressive. We made our selection and returned to our table. Marty saw us return, smiled and came directly to our table to serve us our wine. We couldn't have been more pleased with the entire experience thus far. We began with a delightful cheese plate. My husband had the braised beef which was incredibly tender and perfectly flavorful. I ordered the fish du jour which was a wonderfully delicious snapper dish. For dessert my husband ordered the cr\u00e8me brulee and I ordered the tiramisu. Both were divine. \nWe stayed and selected a second bottle of wine while enjoying the live entertainment which we were told is provided on Wednesday and weekend evenings. The performer was a gentleman with a guitar who did a great job performing cover songs of easy listening music. Very enjoyable performance.\nWhen visiting restaurants, I always ask to speak to management prior to departing. I feel that every customer's input is important to the establishment and recommend that everyone do the same. A charming man with a lovely accent (Spanish?) quickly approached us and introduced himself as Angelo. I told him it was our first time there and wanted to share what a wonderful experience we had. He seemed genuinely grateful for my compliments and thanked us for coming.\nEverything that I had been told is absolutely true. The food is amazing, the wine store is awesome, the staff and service is fabulous and the view and ambiance are incredible!

I don't know if it is a result of sneaking a sip as a kid and hating it or maybe I'm just not designed to like it...whatever the reason...yuck.\n\nNow, that said, I know for a fact that this happens to other people all the time. One contingent drinks wine all the time, the other...not so much. But you gotta go endure the trendy wine bar in order to be social and so...I'm a demographic that goes to these places even though I don't dig rotten grape juice. So the valuable advice I am about to share is useful in a way.\n\nFirst, the decor - \nClassy! it's planted on the side of a ...boutique mall I guess you'd call it. but the light fixtures, furniture, view (hence the name) are all very nice. Bring a date, get him/her drunk and you're doing well.\n\nFood - \nWe ordered a few small plates and they were really good, small is very accurate but y'know, it's a wine bar. It's not like you're going to order a bucket of wings or something. Classy little plates of tasty stuff to go along with your booze. By the way, there is a little candy place around the corner that has chocolate... I have learned that chocolate and wine are a good thing.\n\nWine - \nThere is no way I'm going to sound like i know what I'm talking about here. I did see a bunch of people with wine flights which, for my fellow noobs are little glasses of like 3-4 wines that you can sample. What i did try was a wine called Beaujolais nouveau (Thanks wikipedia!) This stuff didn't taste like the putrid swill most wine tastes like. I actually got pretty buzzed off this stuff.\n\nTIP: Non wine drinkers.... we have been missing out. Liquor hits you too hard and beer makes you feel all full and bloated... wine drunk is my new favorite kind of drunk. Learn to like it!\n\nService - \nThese people could not be nicer! Server was a sweetheart, the Sommelier (wine expert) was such a passionate guy about wine. I think he is from Israel or France or both. Such a nice guy, for real. he'll be more than happy to tell you about what you're drinking.\n\nPricing - \nIt's Vegas, it's wine.... it ain't cheap. That said, it wasn't CRAZY.\n\nSo overall, I'm going to continue trying to like red wine for the mellow wine buzz. The wife will be ecstatic to have a drinking partner if the plan works... wish me luck!\n\nOh, and check this bar out... they have all the standard drinks but you mainly go here for wine.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 2, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "We were celebrating our 16th wedding anniversary!

We had a bottle of Cabernet for $28, which was the starting price but it was still very good.  We ordered both Steak options I would say the strip was more tender and a better value.

No happy hour at the main bar.\n- Happy Hour (5-7) is offered in its cute, little Cheese Shoppe & Bar (no view) across the corridor less than 20ft away, with half-off drinks.\n\nYelpy Details: \n\nOne sunny afternoon, I was walking around Tivoli and spotted the Market Place, which attracted my attention, I stepped in out of curiosity.  Inside the front door was a gorgeous staircase leading upstairs. Even though the Market looked unfinished, the sign says there are shops and eatery upstairs. Well, with curiosity and THIRST, I went upstairs. I was pleasantly surprised to see some cute boutique shops open already, especially delighted to see the View Wine Bar and Kitchen open around the corner with a friendly hostess greeting custmers! She told me that they had two sections kitty-corner to each other; one main bar with a view, one charming little cheese shoppe and bar right across the corridor. Happy Hour, 5-7, is available ONLY in the small bar. \n\nI was too thirsty to wait till 5; the view at the main bar and the pleasant live performance of 2 youngsters were too inviting to pass up, so I took a comfortable seat at the classy bar counter with a direct window view of the plaza fountain, happy hour or not! My friendly and helpful young lady bartender promptly settled me down with a draft Stella ($7), and and the free cheese/vegie appetizer; she went on to introduce me to its menu if small plates and very extensive list of wines!  At the bar there were already 5 other customers; 2 tables nearby were also occupied, all happily applauding the band from time to time.\n\nFor the afternoon, I wound up having a delicious BLT Flatbread ($10), 2 Stella ($7 each), and a glass of house cab (Cypress, $6). I made a check-in on Yelp to this establishment, while I was sitting at the bar, and was pleasantly rewarded with a 15%discount!\n\nThe band performed in the elegant front corner, where there was a piano. The young singer looked 13 but had a very nice, rich voice of 30; his partner accompanied him with good guitar playing, not bad! That band kept me glued to the bar for an extra 40+min!\n\nThe main bar did not offer HH, \nthe drinks and small plates are $5-19. Of course, being a wine bar, they offered a large selection of wines from $6-25 a glass. The lady barkeep, Joey, let me sample 2 kinds of Wasatch drafts ($9) and Earthquake Cab ($25/gl). The Wasatch was OK; the Earthquake was outstanding with its mellow, rich, lingering flavor and smooth texture. Joey is very friendly and attentive! All other staff is also quite pleasant and helpful, making one feel welcome! \n[- See pics of menu]\n\nHAPPY HOUR\n- Its \"Cheese Shoppe\" is a very cute, cozy bar, which offers food and drinks, and cheese, of course! HH is 5-7pm, with half off drinks. That bar has NO view, however, other than the main bar. One can hear and see the live entertainment here, also. When I left the main bar around 5:30, the small bar was almost full.\n\nThe Market Place is handicapped friendly, it has an elevator hidden in a corner beyond the grand stairwell.\n\nNote to Management: There should be a TV facing the bar counter, so customers do not have to turn their necks!\n\nBTW, I was told that the bars and the entire Market building are owned by Chef John Church, who worked with Ramsey and survived!\n\nPeterskis3, Dec 2012", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 7, "cool": 4}}, {"text": "The view is awesome...

It was slow cooked, very tender and the yogurt sauce that accompanied it was perfect.  The risotto was decent.  We weren't that into the grilled cheese.  Even though it was quite different than the average grilled cheese with brie, honey and walnuts, I didn't feel it justified the $7 price.  The 5 onion soup was above average.  Our bartender strongly recommended the cobbler for dessert and it was great.  \n\nThere are a lot of other things we definitely want to try that sounded scrumptious like chicken pot pie nuggets and the pork belly flatbread.

We went on a Saturday and it almost felt like we were accidentally walking into people's private studios or something. The bar itself isn't completely defined, but kind of spills out into the circulation of the market. Too much open space in between slightly oversized tables and chairs flank the 'view' out to the dinky fountain and lovely valet area below. The menu is tapas-style with many reasonably priced, decent sounding items prepared with the \"freshest, seasonal ingredients\" according to their website.

You also have the choice of egg, pork belly, bacon, caramelized onions and a few other items that don't sound as good.\n\nI went with the additional pork belly as I'm always a sucker for it, and what came out a few minutes later looked as amazing as it tasted. The meat had really great fresh beef flavor, not much char but delicious nonetheless and cooked perfectly all the way through. The tomato jam had really good sweet flavor, and the pork belly was really tasty and crispy but not quite present enough. I pulled a few bites out to eat separately and enjoyed them, but would probably just skip it next time to save the dollar and enjoy the rest of the flavors on their own. The shredded lettuce and balsamic glaze were a nice touch. The bun was sweet and fresh; possibly the same as Bachi's but maybe a tiny but more dry. Also the bun was randomly a bit too cold when it first came out, but warmed up a bit because of the patty as I was eating. The cheese was melted but not at all noticeable with the strong beef and jam flavors to compete with it. The three different pickles speared to the top were all great, and a nice touch to start off my meal. In all this was a fantastic burger and a total shock based on other meals I've had there recently.\n\nThe fries were equally fantastic; thick and cooked well tossed with white truffle oil and a dusting of parmesan. Sadly there were way too few of them, they should almost double their serving size so I don't feel like I'm consciously rationing them through my entire meal. The mustard, ketchup and mayo were a good touch too. While $13 might be a few dollars towards the high end for some folks being an off-Strip location, the quality of ingredients and great flavor of this meal make it completely worth it. I'm almost scared as to whether this restaurant will survive based on how few people go to Tivoli, so I suggest you make your way there to eat this burger and keep this place open until I can make it back again.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 3, "cool": 4}}, {"text": "My first time at the Tivoli Village was very memorable- we met a great duo of father/son at Brio happy hour, and we could not stop raving about the View Wine & Bar.

My second visit was for lunch and my husband and I sat by the window with a VIEW of the Tivoli Village rotunda. Because they dishes are tapas style,  we shared 4 dishes:\n* pork and polenta -  this was delicious and I would definitely order it again.  \n* roasted brussel sprouts - I love the fact that the veggies are from the local Farmer's market, but i was not a fan of the way these were prepared.  And I am a brussel sprouts lover.  These were more bitter rather than highlighting the deep nutty flavors.  \n* lobster mac - the lobster was cooked perfectly and the parmesan and brandy cream sauce was the perfect accompaniment. \n* fries poutine - oxtail, cheddar, and red wine gravy.  My husband enjoyed it, I thought it was just OK, but that may be because I was completely carb'd out.  \nThe thing I love about tapas/shared plates is that there is something for everyone, and there is the opportunity to try many different things.  \n\nService was a bit slow, but very friendly.

Unfortunately they do not serve any food at their happy hour. Draft wines for $2 though, are a steal. However the wines are not of the greatest quality. They also serve Stella Artois (on draft) for $3. AS much as I liked the prices, the service was mediocre. My friends and I waited to pay our bills for a good 10 minutes while the one bar server made cheese boards. She literally was away from all of her bar patrons for a good 5-7 minutes.

We also got a pretty awesome spot in front of a window in front of Tivoli's fountain. \n\nI found their wine menu to be somewhat of a disappointment. Yes, they offer a decent variety, but when I think \"Wine Bar\" I was expecting a booklet, not a page. Also, wines from France were sorely missing. There was only two, one of which you could only order per bottle. California and Washington varietals are center stage here. I ordered the \"dryer\" Riesling for $13, which I thought was decent enough, although I've had better. \n\nFood - I wanted the 5 Cheese Soup, but was informed they were out, in a hurry, and not really thinking, I ordered the Tomato Soup instead. What I was served was a puddle of tomato soup in a huge bowl. I will honest-to-God say the bowl had 6 spoonfuls of soup in it. At $6 a pop for a sip of soup I found it to be a huge let-down. Be conscious the style here is \"tapas\", small plates for sharing, but really, was I going to share my 6-spoonfuls of soup? Hell no I wanted a bowl of soup!\n\nI also had the \"Green Eggs and Ham\" Carbonara, which was delicious. The sauces were perfect, the addition of the egg was perfect. The crispy pork belly was not crispy. It was a lump of pork, flaccid and not up to par.

I was wishing I had gone to Brio across the street and paid the same exact amount of money and gotten a huge-ass plate of spaghetti.\n\nI like the idea, but I do not like the execution of The View.

I like the freshness of this dish (compared to the smokey qualities of Firefly's), however it could use salt or another salty component for more contrast.\nLobster Mac: Generous chunks of lobster meat, whole wheat penne, Parmesan, brandy cream, spinach, and sun-dried tomatoes. Slightly under-salted, but I liked that it wasn't overwhelming. But $15? Not worth it.\nOrganic Mushroom Risotto: The dish was prepared well, nice mushrooms. Mushrooms still had bite and the rice had a good consistency. Although, it did seem under-seasoned as well, it was still good.\nChicken Pot Pie Nuggets: These things are amazing. Seriously genius!! Mini little bites of chicken pot pie, not a joke. The batter was so crispy and I love that it was served with freshly shaved Parmesan and lime zest.\nRoasted Brussel Sprouts: Roasted in brown butter with Yukon Gold potatoes, Purple potatoes, pumpkin seeds, crushed cashews, golden raisins. Really good. I would have liked the sprouts to be roasted a little longer to rid it of the bitterness. \nDrunken Shrimp: Large shrimp fried in a Guinness batter, served with a mango-jicama slaw, and housemade vodka cocktail sauce. The batter was deliciously crispy, the shrimp was fresh, and I squeezed a little fresh lime juice before dipping it in the perfect cocktail sauce and added the fresh, crispy slaw per bite. Amazing!\n\nHands down, Chicken Pot Pie Nuggets and Drunken Shrimp are two of the best dishes in my overall dining history.

I could have passed on these, extremely battered.\n\nDessert was an Apple and peach cobbler, this was average, I think I would have rather had the beignets.\n\nAll in all it was a nice dining experience, the reason for the three stars is partially because how the servers demeanor changed once it came to paying the bill.

It's sophisticated with a modern rustic charm. The view from the window tables is beautiful at night. Take a photo of the view and it looks like you're somewhere on a European vacation.\nThe tapas menu boasts farm to table ingredients and some served on wooden planks.\nMy dining experiences at Tivoli Village have been more about experiencing food and flavors, not so much loading up to satisfy a hunger. The common denominator of Tivoli's restaurants is that all of them are pretty and you don't mind sitting and waiting. There's no rush, enjoy the views and appreciate quality over quantity. Even if the food sucks a little.\nYou hope it's going to be a good experience when a majority of the tapas items look appealing and it's a plus when it lists the ingredients. I like to know what goes into something because I might want to try making it later :)  It didn't take us long to know what we wanted to order.\nTUNA TARTARE NACHOS - Light and fresh with hints of citrus, avocado, baby arugula and a touch of lime creme served atop a crispy wonton chip. I could have eaten 4 orders just by myself. I think Summerlin in general has a tuna ration.\nAVOCADO BRUSCHETTA - 4 pieces of toast slathered with guacamole and served with lime wedges. It was good, but essentially guacamole with a light lime creme drizzled on.\nRISOTTO CAKES - It comes with tomato jam (tasted like chunky ketchup), pesto (delicious), olive tapenade (nice and tangy). The risotto cakes were light and crispy and had a slight citrus flavor that reminded me of eating a cookie.\nFRIES POUTINE - Pork belly, cheese and wine gravy with large cut potatoes. This was not very good. The pieces of pork belly tasted more like chewy beef and the wine gravy did not compliment the potatoes or cheddar cheese.\nMARY'S FRIED CHICKEN - This was a big disappointment. It appears that Summerlin does not do fried chicken well at all. The chicken was dark meat and not at all crispy, but rather soggy. The best part of this dish was the roasted brussel sprouts and apple slaw with bourbon raisins. I had never tried roasted brussel sprouts and this was WONDERFUL! I don't know if it's supposed to come with the fried chicken or if the chef just added that on but I'm very happy he did. The sprouts were nice and charred with a sweetness that went well with the apple slaw and raisins. I would come back for this dish.\nTOMATO SOUP - Meh. Tasted like tangy tomato sauce. No seasoning, very blah.\n\nService could have been better. The server asked us how everything was, I commented that I didn't care for the soggy chicken and she said they drizzle some kind of oil on it. Why? Isn't fried chicken supposed to be greasy enough? I mentioned that we were celebrating my wife's birthday and the server didn't even ask if we would like to have a birthday dessert. She just handed us the check and walked away.\nOverall, I appreciated the different \"farm fresh\" items you don't usually see at a tapas bar, but it's nothing special. The ambiance is what you come here for.\n\nP.S. Watch out for crotchety woman that owns the pet boutique around the corner.

Don't get me wrong, the little shop is quite refreshing and wonderful as-is, but it is pretty clear that the coming enhancements (outdoor pet-friendly patio, wine bar) will put this place over the top.\n\nCall me a homer, but I've always felt like the 32nd/Shea region is a wonderful series of neighborhoods (with many model mid-century modern Haver homes, for instance) where the retail and restaurant offerings poorly reflect the themes and quirkier character of some of the neighborhoods.  Thats why I truly appreciate what the folks at 32 Shea are trying to do...they are obviously trying - in menu, decor, ambience, and exterior - to create a true, \"32nd and Shea\" experience that encourages locals to assemble there, while inviting passers-by to integrate there.  So far, they've executed it very well.  For a comparable experience, I would think of the venerable and award winning  \"Mama Java's\" on Indian School. \n\nOf course, it all starts with the menu.  I've already ran through the relatively limited hot breakfast items (Early Bird, New Mexico Burrito) and both were outstanding.  I think, above all, \"freshness\" is what stood out to me.  No Otis Spunkemeyer muffins here, as the pastries are clearly local, playfully designed, and quite good.  I can't yet vouch for the lunch offerings, but the lunch sandwich/salad offerings appear to be quite diverse, and given my breakfast experience,  I think I would order them with confidence. \n\nThe coffee seems to be a local blend, and that can be a good or bad thing, but my first few Latte's tried on separate days indicated that this is a rather fine roast, perhaps over-milked on one occasion, although that is easy enough to correct.  One thing I did notice about my iced lattes is that they were served ICE COLD, which might make you think \"yeah, duh\" but I've tried coffee in every corner of the state, and I can say with certainty that most iced latte's are served in the 43-50 degree range (or even way higher) due to the failure of the barista to control the heated liquid, but I felt like 32 Shea's lattes were in the 35-39 degree range...the right range, just the way momma used to make 'em!\n\nSpace is limited at the moment as the outdoor patio continues its construction, so it can be standing room only at peak times, but its hardly an uncomfortable place to stand.

Once home, I cut the burrito in half, slathered some of the homemade green chili sauce that was included on top, and dug in. Mmm, it was good.

Depending on who comes to the window when I pull up, sometimes I'll just order a regular coffee because I think it will be quicker and less burdensome.\n- There is something about their regular coffee that  is just WAY too acidic for me. I ask for a dark roast, but it doesn't taste anything like a dark roast. It is so acidic that I often question whether someone could have actually slipped lemon juice into the coffee.\n- Too many times, they have not gotten my order right. They have given me the wrong muffin several times and just generally don't give me what I ask for. For example, today I ordered an americano with an inch of almond milk in it. I would never expect anyone to measure exactly, but I can tell you they put less than a tablespoon of almond milk in there and no where near an inch, leaving me with an overwhelmingly lemony, acidic americano that I'm just barely choking down now.\n\nThis place has a lot of great qualities, but ultimately, I'm tired of paying and tipping just so they can get my order wrong and treat me like a piece of trash.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Yesterday was one of those days.

However, we were addicted to the green mermaid and her infinite helpings of caffeinated drinks.  We could get in and get out without much interaction from the staff or clientele.  After speaking to several people who work in the area, we decided to stop in one Saturday morning for a mini-date.  It was the best choice we've made with regards to restaurants in a very long time.  \n\nThis place is small, dark and cozy, with an eclectic menu, music, vibe, and customer base.  Now, reading other reviews, we noticed that there was a common theme: people who sat themselves and waited for employees.  When you enter the establishment, there is a bar and cashier where all ordering is done.  No one will come to your table with a menu.  When we entered we were greeted immediately.  The menu is behind the bar, so we stood checking out our possibilities.  The space is small, so people patiently wait in line inside and outside.  We ordered the Mexican Burrito, the Croissant Sandwich, and the green apple and brie danish to split.  The burrito was flavorful, as was the croissant sandwich.  But the green apple and brie danish blew our socks off.  We had two drinks: the hot mocha and a cold white chocolate mocha and lavender freezachino.  Yes, I said lavender.  It is an incredibly refreshing summer drink.  \n\nWe sat ourselves and waited for our food.  The restaurant was about half full with regular patrons whom the owner and staff greeted by name.  Within a half-hour it was packed. People sat both inside and on the outside patio.  When the customer migration slowed, we had a chance to talk to the owner.  We complimented her food and ambiance.  32 reminds us of some of the coffee places we stop at in San Francisco:  great food, great vibe, great people, all local.\n\nThe second time we came for lunch.  We ordered the Le Grande Tuna and the Juicy Roast Beef.  Both great sandwiches, but the roast beef is now a favorite.  It is a warm roast beef with melted Munster cheese, creamy horseradish sauce on a Ciabatta roll.  To die for!  I had the lavender white mocha again and my husband had the caramel freezachino.  So far we can say  we have not been disappointed with any of the food or drinks.  The coffee never tastes burnt!  I can't say that about other places.  They have a local roaster where they get their coffee and he does a fantastic job.  This time we sat at the bar.  There were 4 or 5 of us.  Pretty soon we were all talking to each other and the wait staff.  Human interaction?  Who knew it could be that good?\n\nWe are now regulars.  We have realized that there are limitations to the order and serving process, simply because of the size of the establishment.  Once you get past that, you will realize what a little gem this is.  32 also has a drive through.  It is nothing to see 2 cars patiently waiting for some one to run their order out.  I think the key word is PATIENCE.  If you want something quick and snappy, please don't punish this place with your bad review.  The second word to consider is LOCAL.  If you want the quick menus with prepackaged food, move on.  The food is really good and meant to be enjoyed. Why only 4 stars, we have not tasted everything on the menu nor have been there in the evening. Also, it is tiny.  I can't really fault them though for that.   When we return for an evening date and finish the menu, I will gladly switch my rating.**\n\nSo, sit down, relax and stay a while.  Order first though and be reminded that good things come to those who wait.\n\n**Added 8/2013  Yesterday was my birthday.

My girlfriend got their New Mexico Burrito as well as a nutella mocha.  And they also had a brie and apple turnover in the pastry display so she got one of those.  She loved the mocha nutella and the brie and apple turnover was an awesome combo of flavors.  The burrito was scorching hot, but good and the salsa was a nice accompaniment.\n\nAs mentioned, its pretty small.  You order from the counter when you walk in and they bring your food to you.  There's a small seating area inside as well as a nice patio outside.  We sat at the outside high table area which looks down on the patio tables.

The menu consists of coffee drinks (and a full bar, though alcohol can't be ordered from your car), as well as salads and sandwiches and a daily soup. With the sandwiches, you get a side of chips or a side salad. I've always gotten the salad, but I prefer swapping the house vinaigrette with ranch. As for the sandwiches, the veggie sandwich, which comes with cream cheese, tomatoes and greens, is tasty - just go light on the greens, unless you'd like a second salad on your sandwich.\n\n32 Shea has a lot going for it - a really cute patio with comfy seating, and eclectic design inside that creates a funky, relaxing ambiance.

That being said I shall begin:\nLa Vigne must have some seriously lofty goals because the ideas were both grande as well as maybe too lofty to obtain. We arrived at around 7:30 p.m. to a nearly bare restaurant on a Friday night. Now, particularly one of the reasons I enjoy dining out is for the atmosphere. I enjoy places that are packed with people, entertainment, servers and jubilation that is certain to change my mood. La Vigne was anything but those hot buttons. There were few dining parties, fewer servers and an empty piano bench sitting next to a baby grand piano. We were  however, greeted by the hostess and shown to our table. She offered a strong wine list as well as two heavily bound menus. The menu was a bit complicated. \nSome of the entrees included Seafood, Duck and Poultry, (the standard fair of a french restaurant. Here is where La Vigne earned the two stars, one for the waiter and one for the delectable dinner bread served with an herbed butter as well as tabled olives.\n\nAt this point I implore caution, please only read further if you are interested in my opinion. If not, drop a few twenty dollar bills into a whole in the ground and bury them because that would be much better than suffering through this food.\n\nAfter a few moments we chose some entrees and began the terrible downturn of our experience. I selected an entree that in French was Fruits de Mer....(Seafood), this included scallops, shrimp, mussels, egg noodle pasta and a bit of sprinkled parsley. My boyfriend chose a chicken and pasta entree. The price for each of these entrees ranged from $18.95 to $26.95 for the seafood. From here we settled in and enjoyed some quiet chatting. There was an appetizing course of French Onion soup for myself as well as a Caesar salad for my companion prior to the main course. Soon the entrees had arrived and we were shocked to see what actually came to the table. Our plates were huge and full of food, some what appearing to over compensate for something by showering us with extremely large portions. \nTaste: I separate this one out, because of my own fondness of food I have a very specific palette that can taste everything in a good meal. In this case I was showered with a terrible entree. The shrimp was over cooked, tough and very chewy, the scallops where well done on the exterior and nearly raw on the interior, whereas the mussels didn't even have a supporting role. What was even more astonishing was the flavor the entire plate of egg noodles. Yes, I said Egg Noodles....just like the ones Mom used to prepare in her Hamburger Helpers. I half expected the pasta to be homemade with the prices they were charging. Secondly, the \"pasta\" was topped with shredded Parmesan cheese. But not the freshly grated fare, no, it was the store bought in a plastic tupperwear, pre-shredded months ago and sitting on the store shelf Parmesan cheese. As I attempted to eat my meal I was reminded that the chef maybe hasn't tried this dish himself because he would be appalled with how bad it tasted. The final nail in this coffin was the olive oil that was drenched over the pasta and seafood. The olive oil was very bitter and had not been infused with anything to save the day. \n\nTo bring an end to recounting this torture I understand that from time to time restaurants experience growing pains.

I wanted to eat good food and drink good wine past 11pm. On a Wednesday. Not too far away from where I live in Tempe. Oh...and I was hoping to have it be semi-romantic. Kazimierz. It was time to finally visit the holy grail of yummy wine olive flatbread goodness. I figured a Wednesday would mean no reservations necessary and  we would miss the dinner crowd.\n\nFinding Kazimierz is definitely a fun part of the excursion-I had the Phoenix native drive while I vainly tried to figure out where it was. I knew there were no signs, but for some reason I pictured hobbit doors with green gabled entranceways and hidden paths. Well. It IS ina strip mall-but damn, they try hard to make you forget. Guessing by the stained glass windows, we went around the corner and followed the signs that led us into a low-ceilinged, warm, rosy place...not quite the warm, casion, cave like atmosphere of Chez Nous, more of a speak-easy.\n\nThere were sofas near the entrance and I checked a menu on a table to make sure we were in the right place (I didn't want to stumble in a cult recruitment/steakhouse or something, you know?) and the friendly shaggy haired bartender told us to sit where ever we wanted. At 11:45pm, there were a good ten people at the long bar to the left. Sofas, chairs, ottomans, all different sizes and configurations were the dominant structure of the large room that opened to the right-but were all occupied. We wandered towards the stain-glassed windows and I hate sitting at tall tables, so we went for a cozy two person table with a small antique round table. This is the kind of place you want to bring people to-far more impressed than I was with Postinos. \n\nThe menu is cheese and bread focused. Goat cheese salad, foccaccia with summer vegetables, antipasto, a variety of flatbreads with morels, crayfish, tomatoes and many kinds of cheese. Cheese platters abound! The wine book is over-whelming, but I love getting red wine flights. I went for the moderately priced 19 one and was blown away by one, please by another, and enjoyed the other robust taste. It was paired with the biggest plate of olives I have ever seen served-I normally devour those suckers and at the end of our stay there was still at least 20 olives left. They were tasty, but I prefer having olives herbed. We went for the flatbreads for optimum sharing. The Tuscany was simple, buffalo mozzarella, tomato, it was simple and clean. Despite lactose intolerance, I am a sucker for truffle oil and went for the Burgundian-brie with morels, brie and truffle oil. People-they DO NOT skimp on the brie. I may have woken up crying with lactaid pills clutched in my hands, but damn if I still didn't eat the last deathly bite-that is HOW GOOD it was!\n\nNow...why one less star? Why throw off the curve? Well, the hip young staff must have been psyched for a slow weeknight...b/c, guys, they were playing Art Brut. Look it up. A shaggy, garage band that screams modern art makes me wanna rock out. WTF? I mean, I saw them live...moshing and dancing with sweaty dudes. Not really wine and olives music. The music continued in this vein all night. Kinda threw off the ambiance. And while I loved the food, I would have liked more non-bread options, like seafood, risotto, something like that. I have to compare to Tapino's, and Tapino's wins on the food variety...and ambiance.

I have been there perhaps 75 to 100 times. I really enjoyed the original crew of Michael, Germann,and Rich really made this vino alley a chill place to drink and relate. Over the years the wine list changed to incorporate more and more fun and non commercial choices. Where else in town can you get Domaine El Bordj from the Atlas Mountain of Algeria. That wine has Farranah, El Maoui and Tizourine varietals in it......picked those up at your local Fleming's lately?\n\nIt is hard I suppose to retain core quality staff and they leave eventually. The new younger XYZ and Nexter service staff are eager but lack knowledge and manners at times. Recently, I took another wine professional friend in there for his birthday and I ordered an  older vintage of Showket Sangiovese. It arrived after 20 minutes, and the young woman opened it for me. As I drew it to my nose I caught the unmistakable TCA vapor. I stated the corked condition of the wine, and rejected this natural flaw. She rather indignantly took the bottle to her manager. The \"manager\" a rather impish sprite of false authority. He poured a taste and took it down. He shook his head, and told the girl \"it's not corked!\"\nDraw a sword on me, Young Lad, and taste the smoke of my blunderbuss. She attempted to hawk the fouled blood of Jupiter back on us which I rather vehemently told her that I needed another wine. We then ordered another vintage of the Showket Sangiovese and after 10 minutes......Voila.....she told us they were out! I then told her that we wanted to order one of the original vintage choices and that we were really THIRSTY! Again, after 5 additional minutes she arrived back and finally opened a delicious wine. The whole episode left a sour taste in my mouth (Pun Intended).\n\nEven more recently, I had a Spanish Wine exporter friend named Juan De Vega in town and he wanted a place to drink cocktails and wine. Not much choice for location other than Kaz so I took him down there. Of course, it was packed to the gills so we could not get close to the bar. Two Young women offered to allow us in to order so we bought a round. We introduced ourselves and they started to play games like kissing each other passionately for our viewing pleasure, although one claimed to be dating the chef. Both us are happily married men and thankfully not intrigued by their act . We attempted to be friendly, but disengage so we could talk wine business. The more mental of the duo became oddly fixated on Juan and kept interjecting rude and schizophrenic comments. I attempted to again be friendly but explain that Juan and I were just attempting to talk business. But Nooooooooo......freaky girl lost it and started to cry. I grew tired of the Mary Hartman Mary Hartman episode, and we paid our bill and bolted.\nI will give Kaz another try down the road, but rude guests and clueless service staff are intolerable to me.\nAnother peeve is the constant damp odor of cleaning supplies that permeate the room. Not so nice when drinking fine wine, but the stemware and wine selection easily overcompensate that peeve.\nWhen there make sure you try a kalishka cocktail (sp) as it is awesome as a house shot.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Tucked away, off of Stetson Avenue, next to Sea Saw and Cowboy Ciao, Kazimierz or Kaz Bar is a hidden gem.

I think Scottsdale, in general, is a fantastic place, so new, crisp, rich, clean, modern.

No - at first glance - it's seems to be a playground for young beautiful white people with too much money to throw around, and not enough sense to give it to me. \n\nI'm sooo gonna get in trouble.\n\nThe point is, the Kazimierz felt genuinely good. It felt like the one place in my adventures where the people were good, and music was true, and the atmosphere was...simply right.

No where to sit. No where to stand. Went with some nasty Goats do Roam wine that gleamed like fresh blood. Swore to myself I'd never be back. Especially because the vibe was so pretentious. \n\nSECOND VISIT\nModerately busy. Was on a date on a weekend. Sat at one of their small tables near the windows, which was close to the entertainment. So, it was loud and very hard to carry on a conversation. We ordered only wine, which was tasty, yet a bit on the expensive side. I was then told that Kaz is a great place to come right when they open their doors at 6 p.m. Scribbled that tid-bit down in my brain. \n\nTHIRD VISIT\nWent shortly after 6 p.m. on a Monday. We were one of the few patrons in the place. Service started off excellent and tapered off as the place got busier (8:30). We each ordered a wine flight, after having asked our server for suggestions/help. We also went with the cheese tray (6 cheese for $20) that comes with a heap of fresh fruit and a couple different nuts on the side, with two small baguettes. It was DELICIOUS. The gouda was my absolute favorite, with its smokey finish. I HIGHLY recommend you share the cheese plate with somebody. You can order all 6 for $20 or opt for a small order at $4 a piece. It's a full meal and it tastes soooo good, especially with a nice flight of wine. \n\nWhile the music detracted from the atmosphere (pop and punk to Bob Marley), it's not so noticeable that you aren't able to relax. Time slipped by. At the end of the evening, my friend and I had enjoyed our own flight and the huge cheese tray for $25 each. Not bad for Kaz! \n\nOur service ended poorly. We had to ask the guy re-filling our water to take our check. It seems our server decided to ignore us, though she was earlier quick to point out that normally Kaz doesn't allow for a complimentary side of olive oil with the cheese tray - that only she does it for her customers. Uhm, disclose much? It's not like we asked for a kidney. \n\nBy the time we left, nearly all the tables and lounge spots were reserved.

Otherwise, you may not be able to find a comfy seat, you may be asked to fork over a cover charge or you may hate the weekend night vibe and get the entirely wrong impression of this place. \n\nJUST A TIP:\nThey don't do happy hour.

Come here if you really like olives. This place gets a solid 4 stars, due to good wine, decent food and the enjoyable and somewhat surreal time I had there. Here's how it went down: my date and I arrived and were very casually greeted (we had hovered by the door, and then walked half way across the room before anyone spoke to us) and eventually shown to a table in the cavernous, very dark, and completely empty dining room. We were given the wine list, the bottle list and a food menu. A few minutes later, the waitress wandered over and asked if we'd been there before. I hadn't, so she explained that they had a  wine list, a bottle list, and a food menu. I think what she meant was, \"please don't order a glass off the bottle list,\" but it sounded more like, \"we have these new things called menues here, which you may not have heard of, and they have different things printed on each one.\" The wine, when it came, was pretty good. I had a nice syrah (black pepper and mothballs on the nose, but it improved dramatically with a little time), and my date had a delicious zin. Instead of pouring a glass of wine and bringing it to you, or pouring the glass at your table, at Kazimierz they pour you a tiny carafe of wine and bring that to the table. It's so cute and pretentious that you have to love it.  Several hours of pleasant conversation followed, to be interupted by a dj...that's right, a dj, looking pretty out of place.....who began mixing in the corner. Eventually we moved to the other side of the restaraunt, where it was a little quieter, but much colder--I was practically hypothermic by the time we left-- and ordered some food. My date is not what you would call an adventurous eater, so we got the Tuscany pizza--basically a cheese pizza. The crust was really flaky and light, the fresh basil was a great touch, and it had a good (not overpowering) amount of cheese. We also got the olives. Now, I had been rolling my eyes about Kazimierz since early afternoon when I read the yelp reviews and looked at their menu. They will sell you a \"handful of hazelnuts\" for $3, which strikes me as marketing genius, assuming anyone is buying it. I assumed, therefore, that the olives would also come in a quantity loosely described as a handful. Well.....possibly they've got the Mogollon Monster, whom I've just been reading about, working in the kitchen, because I have never been served so many olives at one time. Never. It was a soup bowl of olives. Turns out my date doesn't eat olives. Turns out I only eat about 20 olives at a sitting. However, the waitress cheerfully supplied us with a take-out box for the surplus. I weighed the box when I got home: 1.5 lbs! That is a lot of olives. \n\nOverall, I would cheerfully return to Kazimierz, but I would bring a sweater and a guy with a more adventurous palate. The menu--when it doesn't get lost in pretention (the above-mentioned handful of hazelnuts, the \"precious drops of truffle oil\" that grace one of their pizzas) is pretty exciting, the bottle list is staggering, and the service is cheerfully lackadaisical.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "The overpowering smell of garlic has gotten me a couple times.

That part is not their fault. What is their fault is that the band they did have was, frankly, below average. A guy on drums, a guy on guitar sort of muttering very quietly into a mic for a few minutes between sitting with his buddies drinking for about fifteen minutes. Not worth a $5 cover, folks. Get some real talent in here, please or don't charge me the cover to watch the \"band\" drink and goof off with their friends at the table next to me. \n\nSecondly, we walk in and the place is totally done up in Christmas decorations. It just really cheapened the whole place and I don't remember this place being so kitsch. I felt sort of gross and like I was in a bad sitcom.

Now, seriously, I wanted to laugh out loud when I walked in the door.\n\nThirdly, service was awful. Slow, snobby and inattentive. I don't recall that from my past visits. Our waitress was seriously abysmal and more than once I was tempted to flag down someone else since she was just so cold, unhelpful and unfriendly. Do you want me to order more so I can give you a bigger tip or don't you? \n\nFourthly, we really wanted to have some cheese with our wine so we asked for a food menu and were told, oh, yeah, we closed the kitchen early tonight.

We read the sign which peaked our curiosity and went to the back entrance. The wooden door in the back simply has a sign that reads above it \"The Truth is Inside.\" It was a little intimidating because no one was around. No doorman or host. Walked in, finding myself in a cavernous, spacious room with sofas and tables scattered about. We must have looked lost as we were greeted and seated almost immediately. The ambiance of the place immediately appealed to me as it reminded me of low key hole-in-the-wall lounges from my time in New York. No deuce-baggery or typical crowd from party-town Scottsdale that you'd normally see in the area. Everyone seemed to be nestled in their own world with their friends, immersed in conversation or even just the moment. \n\nOnly a couple draw-backs I found with the place. The server that was taking our orders was fairly bad, with my party having to literally waive him down every time. Also he seemed less knowledgeable about certain drinks than we did. Other tables had noticed this as well, with patrons seeming mildly frustrated. After waiting 10 minutes for my Old Fashioned. I asked another server where my drink was she retorted \"I am sure your server will be with you shortly,\" and then walked away.

The Old Fashioned itself was poorly made, watered down with too much club soda and an inordinate amount of fruit smashed at the bottom of my glass. I would recommend avoiding specialty cocktails, though I have not tried other drinks on their menu. I opted to try beer for the next round. The beer menu humored me a bit, as did the wine list. The owners seemed to really take the namesake Kazimierz \"World\" Wine Bar to heart. The beer and wine list seemed to be a melange of randomly selected beers and wines from different countries, with no real particular direction or reason. That being said I did try a random beer and it was not half bad. \n\nWhat really rectified the experience for me was the music. The deejay last night was incredible, a mix of old jazz, funk and soul beats; definitely played into my growing affinity to Kazimierz.

So let me break it down for you. We walked in to this cool little spot on the Sunday before Memorial Day and it was about half full. It looked like it was VERY groovy but I seriously had to use my phone to walk around because it was SO dark. We sat at the bar and not one of the bartenders addressed us for like 15 minutes. Maybe they couldn't see us? Anyhoo the wine list is interesting and I was having a hard time choosing something. The one bartender that finally waited on us had NO personality. I asked for a taste of a few things they had by the glass. They sounded very interesting but I had never heard of quite a few of them and I pride myself on knowing my wine. The first one I tried was a syrah blend that had something to do with chocolate and it was just that...too chocolatey. My friend ordered a glass of the Justin Cabernet which is always a safe bet. I then asked for the Tannat they had by the glass. It was awful. It taste like it had been opened for days. I told our personality challenged bartender and he went and tattled on us to maybe the manager? The manager then came over and was pleasant if a bit condescending at first. He said \"well have you ever had a Tannat? and I said \"actually, all the time, I know what they're about and that is no Tannat\" he then did agree with me and said \"just tell me what you're looking for\" I told him I wanted a Cabernet Franc or Grenache which they didn't have either by the glass. He ended up pouring me something that really was delicious. He definitely redeemed the evening because he was professional and helpful. We then ordered the flatbread with pesto and a few different cheeses and it was seriously one of the better flatbreads I've ever had. They had two guys playing live music and they were very good. So my break down is:\nAtmosphere - 4\nAttitude - 1 except for the knowledgeable bartender, he gets a 10\nFlatbread - 10\nQPR - 10...for those non-winey's this is quality price ratio", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "The moment you walk in, you kind of get the feeling that you're walking into a dark basement.

You can talk to one another by candlelight while listening to a variety of background music or you can come when there's a band playing (which I have unfortunately missed out on and am curious about). It is pretty dark though, so maybe it's also a good place if you're nervous to talk to the person you're going with because maybe it'll be an easier setting to talk since you don't really see each other even with candle light... \nWhen I went this past Sunday around 7-ish, it wasn't crowded which gave me a sigh of relief.

We came when Charlie Rae was there who was absolutely AMAZING. This girl is going to be huge. Like if Ray Lamontagne and Lauren Hill had a love child. Her voice seriously gave me goosebumps. Do yourself a favor and look up her stuff. Anywho, back to Kaz Bar. This venue was dark and smelled like smoky wood and was filled with people just having a chill fantastic time enjoying wine and the amazing talent on stage. The whole audience got involved clapping, singing and dancing around. This would be a killer date spot. Didn't try the food but like the sign says, The Truth is inside. The truth is this place rocks.

This surprised me as there were numerous couches open throughout the place, but these are apparently saved for parties of six or more. Even when the place is packed. Then the waitress failed to return to take my drink order so I was forced to make my way to the bar. The bartender took his time disengaging from the woman at the bar that he was obviously hitting on and he seemed annoyed that he had to leave to get me a glass of wine. Then there was the wine, not so great. It was a reasonably priced malbec blend from Argentina which got me pretty excited, but it had obviously been opened for far too long and the taste(or lack of) was reflected by this fact.

Fabulous indeed. \n\nThe fine folks from FnB are taking over Old Town with their local-loving style and three fresh concepts: Baratin, Bodega, and AZ Wine Merchants. The focus, as always, is great food, great drinks, and great vibes. And no one would be able to pull it together so beautifully as the FnB team. \n\nBaratin is that quaint caf\u00e9 you stumble across while exploring the streets of Paris - or in this case, the Kiva Center courtyard on 5th Avenue in Scottsdale. Peeking through those sky-high windows, you will catch a glimpse of casual, caf\u00e9 dining at its finest. Clean lines, reclaimed Ponderosa wood bar and tables, a mixture of vintage and modern fixtures, and intriguing art set an intimate tone that warms the room. In its very small space, Baratin is set up to serve a clientele looking for a casual yet intimate place to stop for bite to eat. Baratin will serve the best that Arizona has to offer in a few ever-changing plates: A snack, a salad, a veggie, a meat/cheese plate, a sandwich, and a dessert, served alongside an ever-changing menu of half bottles of wine, local beer, and dainty cocktails. You can choose your seat to overlook the lovely courtyard and take in the vibe, or you can sit at the bar to watch the magic unfold. With only 28 seats, you will always be in the best seat in the house.\n\nFact: anything that Charlene Badman makes, you will love. The opening sandwich was amazing: Tender Belly bacon, butternut squash, goat cheese, greens and crispy onion on focaccia. The veggie was amazing: grilled broccoli with fried egg, whole grain mustard aioli, butter croutons and olives. And the citrus marinated olives served with grilled bread was, of course, amazing. \n\nWith its changing menu and very reasonable price point, I imagine Baratin will be a place to stop in (very) frequently to satisfy those foodie cravings and share a bottle of wine. As FnB's flirty younger sister, Baratin is definitely catching my attention.\n\nBefore you leave, take the tour of the small Bodega. You'll find a tiny foodie paradise filled with delicious Charlene creations, locally-sourced veggies, cheeses, oils, and meats. There are adorable aprons for sale, and Sweet Republic ice cream. What more could you need? \n\nBaratin-Bodega-AZ Wine Merchants - one-stop for all of your local, foodie-loving needs.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 4, "useful": 8, "cool": 8}}, {"text": "Usually you would never want to review a restaurant after one experience, on day one, but it was something that had to be done. In fact, my dad and I were the first two customers, and were immediately fussed over by the master of schmoozing, Pavle Milic. Him and partner Charleen Badman have teamed up for a simpler concept to the ever classy FnB.\n\nThis 20-something seat cafe is very casual and comfortable that you don't even notice sitting at the bar for two hours over a bottle of wine and a few appetizers. The staff, very similar to the staff at FnB. Some of the same people, fussing all over you and taking care of you is a great feeling.\nWe ordered a bottle of Dos Cabezas 'Red,' which is their red table wine. I'm a huge fan of Dos Cabezas, and for them offer a bottle for under $40, I was very pleased. We needed some food, so we ordered their marinated olives. A standard, but good nonetheless. The pork rillette was absolutely amazing. Rich, savory, salty and delicious. Coming in a glass jar, surrounded by lard, we knew this was going to be amazing. It also came with a small pickled salad of radishes and whole grain mustard that were excellent compliments. We couldn't stop spreading the rillette on the freshly toasted crisps, and had to get more to finish. It was an excellent portion size. \n\nWe were in the cafe for two hours, had a bottle of wine, a bowl of olives, and the pork rillette. It was more than enough food, and with tax and tip it was roughly $60. That's an excellent deal. If we would have substituted the olives out for something larger portioned, like a salad or sandwich, the bill would have only been $3 more, and that would be a full meal for two.\n\nI think Pavle and Charleen are going to blow Old Town away with Baratin. The price points are so great, the quality is impeccable, and the service is flattering. I feel like this is the perfect compliment to FnB. Baratin allows for the same quality of food but it's more accessible than the white table clothed FnB. Also, a huge benefit is their two retail concepts on either side of Baratin. To the left is AZ Wine Merchants that is your one-stop-shop for any Arizona wine you could dream of, including all of the local wines they serve at Baratin.

The restaurant is Baratin at lunch time and FnB for dinner. I was here for the Batatin lunch which has a constantly changing menu because they only use fresh, local, organic ingredients. The menu is very short for lunch (only six items on the menu when you include the desert) and much longer for the FnB dinner.  It doesn't matter that the menu is short because if you come with an open mind, you will get a great meal whether you are a meat eater or a vegetarian. Everything on the menu is very good gourmet food at a reasonable price.  The Baratin lunch menu is much more simpIe than the FnB dinner menu but it is just as enjoyable. They only cary local Arizona wines and draft beers. They also serve delicious cocktails. I ordered the fresh squeezed lemonade and a turkey sandwich called the Macy's Day Parade Part 2. The lemonade was so good! Probably the best lemonade I have ever had. It had a little bit of pulp in it. It was just the right balance of sweet and sour. The sandwich was smoked turkey, avocado, mustard greens, feta and green Harissa on fresh gourmet artisan bread. I don't know what Harissa is but I love it now! It made this sandwich pop! It seemed to be a savory type of relish or tapanad. The fresh greens and smokey turkey made this a great experience on the toasted artisan bread. The sandwich was clean, fresh, savory, flavorful and filling. The sandwich came with a mix of pickled vegetables that have the perfect tangy accompaniment to the sandwich. The vegetables were green beans, onions, squash, cauliflower, greens, cucumbers, carrots, and celery. Together you have a great symphony of flavors dancing on your tongue.  End the meal with the butterscotch \"puddin\" and you will be ruined for life on pudding. The pudding is so full of butterscotch flavor and sweet but not overly sweet. It is topped with fresh whipped cream and baking spice or nutmeg which reminds you of pumpkin pie, as does the thick texture, but it is pudding and it will haunt your dreams. This pudding is the stuff dreams are made of. It is the one dish that is always on the menu. The only problem with the butterscotch pudding is that i can't get my tongue in the bowl to lick it clean, but maybe that was intentional since other people in the restaurant probably don't want to see me stoop to such actions.  The restaurant is not pretentious at all. The employees are always very sweet and give great service. If I lived or worked by Baratin I would come here every day and not get sick of it.
