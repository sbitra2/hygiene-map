That would have been a good way to let people know they weren't there! We ended up at Roamin' Dough and had delicious meatball sacks (she said sack.)\nThis Friday, we finally found our balls! (Heehee.) They had two types: Godfather and Zorba. We decided on the Godfather. We asked the gal how big her balls were (heehee, I'll stop now) and she said they were big enough to share. We were glad because $10 for a meatball sandwich sounded a bit high. She then informed us they were out of cheese...mozzarella AND feta. Blah. We went ahead and ordered it to share, along with some sweet potato tots.\nAre you kidding me? Ten bucks for TWO average sized meatballs on half a sub roll? It needed more sauce and the cheese sure would have been nice. The meatball itself was flavorful, but the texture was a bit gristly (granted, I am super picky about my meat.) The sweet potato tots were fine, but nothing magical for $3.\nI'm bummed. I REALLY wanted to like Haulin' Balls.

Of course it can't compare to certain establishments that offer a dine-in experience, but the food is excellent for the price (You can get a very satisfying meal for less than 10 bucks), so I'm rating it as such. Things such as schedules become really important to me so that I can adequately track down the truck and plan to go if I'm in the area on a particular day.\n\nReview:\nSausagefest.  It's the 1:30AM phenomena that happens to a good majority of clubs on the Strip.  As a straight male, it's when all the eye candy leaves the club, and all that's left in the club are a bunch of drunk dudes that push and shove as they try to find out where all the girls are.\n\nWhile not a fan of the name of the truck, it's definitely a place that has great sausages.  Oliver says that all his sausages are made by a German shop in LA and has them shipped over. (He's right, I haven't really found any exceptional fresh made sausages from the local meat shops here.) \n\nBut wait, it's not just the sausages, it's the extra toppings that make them even more amazing.\n\nExample: The Bollywood: Take a nice fresh chewy bun, put a sausage in it, top with ground beef curry and raita.  Yeah, it looks like it could kill you, but it gives your tastebuds life.  I assure you that even though it looks like a chilidog gone wrong, it tastes much better than a chilidog.\n\nOther sandwiches I've tried are the Bahn Min (really good, one of their signature dishes), and the Italian job (also good.)\n\nFries are pretty good too.  They're the skin-on type fries.\n\nDoes the food keep well if it's take-out?  It does reasonably well for trips less than 10 minutes (actually tested).  Fries, not so good (but they're pretty hard to keep in prime condition, no matter who's serving them).  They come in Styrofoam boxes if you order it to go.\n\nMy only real gripe about this truck is that scheduling is a bit haphazard.  You basically find out about where it's going to be probably 2-3 hours before they're there (if you're lucky you get overnight notice).  Not ideal for planning. (-1 star here.

The Sausagefest food truck has been on campus for awhile. Yes, the name is suggestive, but the food is good. One day I had the baja chicken sandwich meal and another day I had a longanisa banh mi sandwich meal. A sandwich, regular cut fries, and a drink currently costs $9. They also have a card that's \"Buy 9 meals, get 1 meal free!\" and you can purchase a meal either at the Sausagefest food truck or their sibling truck, Tacofest for it to count.\n\nbaja chicken - baja chicken sausage, avocado, tomato, onion, chipotle salsa\n\nlonganisa banh mi - longanisa (Filipino sausage), carrot, daikon, cucumber, jalapeno, cilantro, chili paste, mayo\n\nI feel like there's too much bread/too little sausage in the sausage-bread ratio, but the food is delicious and I'm left full afterward.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Five star for a food truck.

I definitely wasn't looking for a steaming bowl of chili.  I stumbled upon good food for no other reason that it happened to be close to where I parked my car.  Browsing the menu, it hit me how delicious a wrap or a salad would be on this scorching hot summer day.  \n\nThe thai tofu sounded excellent and a woman standing next to me was chowing down a wrap filled with a very generous portion of the stuff.  I asked her how it was and she started raving about how much she loves the thai tofu and gets it all the time.  She loved it so much that she couldn't even take a break from eating, instead describing it to me as she went at it.  But, I was torn.  A salad called strawberry love was calling my name.  I had to try it, and let me just say, I'm in love with strawberry love.  This was hands down one of best salads I have ever had in my life.  I was nervous about a salad from a cart given the searing temperatures, but the mixed greens were crisp and fresh.   Now, a salad can only be a great meal if it is a) big, and b) has lots of stuff in it.  This one certainly fit the bill.  The salad completely filled the large bowl it came in along with my stomach once the bowl was empty.    Generous portions of feta cheese, sliced strawberries, and crunchy roasted almonds meant this was no boring salad.  I elected not to have red onions.  There were several protein options, and I went with the chicken, which was piled high on top.  Dressing was a house made vinaigrette and it was excellent.  You won't find something with this much flavor on a shelf at woodman's.  I requested very light dressing and to have the salad tossed.  This was done correctly and quickly with a smile.  I got all of this for about $7 and they even take credit card!\n\nAs I ate my salad, the owner, Melanie emerged from her trailer to talk to me about her food.  It's obvious that she is passionate about what she is doing.  A lot of businesses use buzzwords like local, organic, natural, etc. for marketing purposes.  For Melanie, it's not just a buzzword; it's a way of life.  She knows about the farmers where she sources her produce.  She cares about the miles her food travels not only because of its impact on the environment but also because lettuce that travels less is crisper; locally sourced strawberries picked at the peak of perfection instead of ripened in a refrigerator car are sweeter.  The chickens themselves, the farmers who raise them, the employees who prepare them, and the customers who eat them; Melanie cares about her food chain every step of the way.  It goes way beyond mere marketing.  The end result is a cart that has a misnomer name.  Good Food isn't good; it's spectacular!
