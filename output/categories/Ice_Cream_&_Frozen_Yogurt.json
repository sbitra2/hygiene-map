I figured - location, location, location and this poor little buddy went down because it didn't have a good location or something. I stammered in anyways and to my dismay they were indeed open - the workers all kind of looked like they were bored out of their mind. I was thinking, maybe they are indeed hurting for business.\n\nI ordered the #1 and it was delicious. Their fries were little shoe-strings that were browned just right. Perfect. I generally like the opposite end of the fry spectrum - big meaty potato wedges, but these were really, really good. I was impressed.\n\nThe burger was equally good. I am a big fan of \"old school\" hamburgers that feel like they were made out of raw meat and thrown on a grill. These may have not been made out of raw meat, but they seemed like it. I will warn you though, even the double patty deal was about the same thickness as a single 1/4lb patty elsewhere. So yes, these patties are thin, almost crumbly. So if you're hungry you might want to order a second or just really concentrate on the fries (which they seemed to give a lot of). This is a little odd but I really liked that they gave a whole dill pickle slice for the pickle. I love pickles so they won my heart on that front.\n\nI had never had custard before (gasp from the gallery, I know) so I wanted to try that before I left. how bad could it possibly be?

We got the Chocolate Brownie Delight.\n\nOn a total random note I really liked the \"fry sauce\" which I think was just ketchup and mayo mixed. I reminded me of the middle-school days when we would mix up the two and eat it on everything on our plate.\n\nI'll give this place a 4.5/5.

Anyways, my boyfriend and I shared the #6 combo- double cheeseburger California style combo with the Chicago style hot dog. The burger had a piece of hair on my bf's hamburger patty! The meat tasted plain and dry. The fries were shoe string fries but had too much salt!!! The Chicago style hot dog was wrapped in a butter toasted bread with an all beef frank, peppers, onions, and some celery salt. The hot dog was overpriced for a small piece of meat, same size as your typical grocery store hot dog. If you take a bite of the hot dog itself, it is very salty...Overall, while the concept they were trying to create was cool, the food itself needs to work out some major kinks.

The dining area is pretty spacious,airy,open ceilings. There is also a drive thru, didnt see any cars go thru during my visit. So FYI there is drive-thru service Yelpers. BTW the address is listed wrong..should be 9809 (see my photo) \n\nService - Hard workers!!! Minute you walk into the place you are greeted by smiling faces eager to help you. In fact one of the employees saw us walking up from the parking lot and opened the door and greeted us. For being so new it was nice to see staff was confident when giving descriptions of their menu items. You place, pay and pick up your order at the counter when your number is called. Our wait time was less than 3 minutes.  Tables were cleaned up pretty quick.  Eagle eyed workers also came around and continuely cleared our table as soon as dirty napkin,empty straw wrapper hit the table...no kidding! \n\nFood -  Ordered their Orig Freddy's Dbl Steakburger which was their plain burger just pickles are on it..cheese was xtra.

Our order came to $20 for all  food and drinks! \n Everything was cooked to order,  so food was still hot when we sat down to eat.\n\nThe burger patties are pretty lean, no greasy oozing out mess here. They are smashed thin so the texture of the edges were pretty  brown & crisp on the outer part and cooked well done inside.  They're evenly seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic.(that's what my tastes buds detected)  The bun was buttered and toasted. If you're a big eater the portions might be small for you, but it was perfect for me, it satisfied my red meat craving and  I didnt feel guilty \"super sizing\" it to a double burger.\n\nThe fries were the shoestring variety, still hot and still crisp with all the chili and velveta like cheese poured on it.  Their chili is a tad salty for my taste.  Mr. B said the hot dog was okay, I thought the buttered Texas toast was a different and cool take for a hot dog bun.  \n\nThe custard I ordered was a Vanilla concrete, similar to DQBlizzard. I dont get why it's called a \"concrete\" though, I was thinking it was going to be served up as brick..lol  The custard concrete is like a real thick ice cream but more dense, creamier..and felt very  rich & fattening ..the mixin I chose was caramel.  The custard was good but I only had a few spoonfuls since I was stuffed as it was.(so note.. order it to go next time) .  \n\nOverall we enjoyed our meal, food was good, service great!

I was SHOCKED to find that Freddy's does the steakburger BETTER than Steak 'N Shake!  The meat is flavorful, the cheese is very melty (sorta like In 'N Out), and the bun is light and buttery.  The fry sauce goes well on both the burgers and the fries.  Speaking of fries... I think the fries are the most notable difference between Freddy's and Steak 'N Shake.  Both chains are known for their shoestring fries.  However, Freddy's fries are fried to golden perfection and seasoned with this incredible seasoning salt blend.  SNS is known for undercooked, underseasoned, cold fries that I only find palatable if drenched in piping-hot cheese sauce.  \n\nI haven't tried the custard.  I don't eat custard, but I'm curious.

The girls behind the counter and who also deliver the food were unfriendly and almost to the point of rude. The older man was at least a lot friendlier. When one of the girls delivered our food we asked for ranch and mayo for a group of 4 adults and 6 kids, she came back with 2 ranch and 2 mayo's so we asked for more and wow I guess that was the wrong thing to do because she was not happy with that. Well if they had the condiments out where we could get them I would've gladly gotten them myself. And then my friends patty melt bread was burnt (I got the same thing and my bread was not) so I went up to ask for a new burger and the girls all looked at me like \"Are you serious??\" definitely not Culvers friendly not a problem attitude. I didn't even want to go back up to order our deserts they were so unfriendly. Really disappointed with this location!! I am so embarassed that I brought friends to it. They were not impressed.

The employees are friendly, the service is great, and the interior (if I go in) is always clean.  \n\nMy rating here predominately reflects the chain's new \" Pepper Grinder Pub Burger\" which is getting a lot of TV promotion.  The commercials tout 'two burger patties, bacon, cheddar and Swiss cheese, and a peppercorn sauce.'  I couldn't resist trying it. \n\nI don't know what it is about Culver's, but their cheese is only visible on the outside of the bun.  When you open up the sandwich, there is no trace of it.  Either the cheese is so thin it \"evaporates\" during cooking, or maybe it has a high water content and converts to steam.  Anyway, for a burger with two cheeses - you cannot taste it unless you pull off a piece on the outside of the bun.  My Pub burger was so dry it was like chocking down a burger without cheese.  The same also applies to the \"peppercorn sauce\" - I could not see it or taste it, and that added to the dryness of the sandwich.  \n\nCulver's is a little pricey (why I normally get a single cheeseburger), but the Pub burger is quite up there - ringing in at $5.69 and over $6.00 with tax.  I found it to be a big disappointment for the reasons above.  Culver's needs to remedy their 'disappearing cheese' and in the case of the Pub burger, not spray paint on the peppercorn sauce.

They also offer a selection of different cooked veggies as sides.\n\nBut it's all about the burger for me.  The Bacon Deluxe served with two fresh, never frozen, beef patties seasoned well cooked to almost perfection with hot-melty-cheesy goodness, two slabs of bacon, served up hot and fresh on a lightly buttered bun with lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo and pickles.  Now you can create any type of burger you want so don't let their menu deter you from ordering something you would like that may not be on the menu.\n\nThey have those crinkle fries and great onion rings.  My family loves their fried cheese curds (little balls of cheese fried, imagine that).  You can get either one covered with chili and cheese if you wish.\n\nSome people go to this place just for the frozen custard but I recommend getting their lemon ice with blue berries!

Probably because they use prime rib for the meat.  That is not the cut of meat that is used in a Philly steak sandwich.   The meat should be either rib eye or skirt steak, shaved thin.   Besides the meat the second most important part of the sandwich is the bread.  The rolls they use for the steak are too soft and mushy.  At first I thought it was just a large hot dog bun.  It should be on a good Italian roll or baguette, crusty on the outside and soft inside.   I ordered my steak with white American cheese.  The cheese did not have much of a taste and wasn't creamy like a good brand of cheese (Land of Lakes, Clearfield) would have been.  The one thing they did right was chop the meat up on the grill.

The windows have probably not been cleaned for a while now as there were dead \"gnat like\"  insects lining the ledges and near the two tables which are arranged alongside these ledges that I have observed between a visit several days ago (Mar 12, 2013) and my current visit on March 14, 2013).  Since doors are open many times during this time of year, specifically, it may prove to be a non-issue, as the days increasingly become warmer.  I did observed the staff handling the lettuce, onions and other ingredients by hand. (Note:  Even if a staff member, cook or the preparation staff uses the restroom and washes their hands, for example, touching any community surface(s) or  the door handle to that restroom, and after washing your hands, ultimately cancels out the hand washing benefits.  Touching doors and surfaces and then preparing things like salads, or touching rolls used for sandwiches is obviously an oversight but still poor habits for an food preparing establishment.  I usually rely on the fact that the meat inside is cooked sufficiently with the onions that there will be no apparent issues upon devouring it as a sub!  To date, I hesitate to go back but I have done so due to the cooking effect (heat) and quality of the hot subs offered.  I hope the owner or manager reads these comments because I would have loved to have given 4 stars on this restaurant; however, hygiene is as important as the product taste at the end of the day.

I can't say I tried every flavor, so I can't comment on Sarah G's comment that the Twangy Tart was not the same.

Some time when I have a girls' night, I am going to get some of this sorbet and blend it back at home with some tequila. I swirled the coconut and pineapple flavors and topped it with strawberries and backberries. It was divine.\n\nThe price right now is $0.36/oz, but David is working with that as to avoid sticker shock for his loyal clients who are used to the other pricing. It should be noted that this location does have crepes, custard, and shakes. Those are not self-serve.\n\nI like the serve-yourself idea because it opens up all new possibilities.
