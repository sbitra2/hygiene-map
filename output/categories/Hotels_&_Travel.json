Sure is. We've got restaurants and Wal-marts along with an ever-growing population to rival Chandler/Gilbert. \n\nAnd we've got OLIVE OIL. Scrumptious and pesticide-free Olive Oil. (While that's considered Organic, they are not yet certified to make that claim). There's olive tastings in the Mill Store and tours of the farm and Mill. Check out their website at  www.queencreekolivemill.com for more info. Just walking into the store, you can watch it being bottled through a large plate glass window.\n\nI'm a firm believer in \"buying local\" to reduce carbon emissions & to support our local economy. Q.C. Olive Mill's  been featured in several magazines, PBS & Arizona Highways, and more. Saw it all with my own eyes.\n\nAnd the flavors...mmm.mmm...You get to taste the different flavored olive oils, the tapenades, locally-grown nuts, fresh artisan breads & crackers. And if that doesn't fill you up, there's del piero, their small bistro that features sandwiches, tasty fresh side dishes, soft drinks , pastries & coffee drinks. \n\nThankfully they've added indoor seating for those scorchers but I'd opt for the outdoor area next to the small herb garden on cooler days & nights.\n\nWarning: The olive oil'll set you back a little over $11 for 8.5 oz and a whopping 15 buckaroos for the slightly larger. However, if you are a connoisseur of olive oil, you'll want to splurge for these flavors, trust me. I think this is an awesome place to make a host or other gift basket.\n\nDirections: Check it out. From Rt. 60, I'd take Ironwood Rd about 10 miles south to Combs Rd. Make a right and it's a mile up on the right. \n\nOr from 60, go south on Ellsworth. Left at Ocotillo Rd. Right onto Rittenhouse.

I guess this is a perfect place for the girls to get together for lunch but if you have a man that has a pretty hearty appetite like mine then he may not quite be satisfied with what he receives.It was perfect for me. I ordered a paninni that had roasted squash, peppers, arugula, fennel garlic aoli and a parmesan balsamic sauce on it. It was very good. Came with a side of kettle style potato chips and some olives.

Mom likes the Parmesan stuffed olives and kept going back for more. \nThe olive oils are pure, light and have delightful flavors like meyer lemon, blood orange, vanilla and garlic.  They aren't  your run of the mill olives. \nThe oils can be used for many different types of cooking and give great flavor to any dish even cakes and breads.

I plan to go back and purchase the lemon oil  as well as plain olive oil   on my next trip. You can also purchase some flavors at AJ's . \n\nTake the tour .

Hands down, QC olive Oil was the best on many levels, and generally more affordable than its competitors (not to mention an entirely awesome local product).

While at first, I was happy to find QC Olive Oil at AJ's, I realized that I needed a more reliable supplier close to home, which is when I found that they have an ongoing presence at several farmers markets and I can order their products from ZonieBaskets.com.

After that discussion they walk you into a tent, where you sit at picnic tables and the tour guide goes through the steps of making olive oil via a few posters hung on the walls.  The presentation was pretty informative, but there was no actual tour of anything.  At the end you received a tasting of about 5 different kinds of olives sold in the store.   The olives were good, worth the five bucks for the \"tour\"... but it was just a little disjointed because the tour was about making olive oil, yet they give you an olive tasting at the end (Which they did not mention once).   We ate lunch at the restaurant inside and overall we were all pleased with our meals.  I had a veggie Panini, with potato chips.  The veggies were fresh and the chips very crisp, with just the right about of salt.  I tried one of their famous Meyer Lemon cupcakes, it was okay.

Begin your visit with a $5 tour, which \"walks\" you through the growing process, and what makes Queen Creek an excellent location for Olive groves.  Why, although not organically certified, these olives are not treated with chemicals or pesticides.  Find out about the olive harvest, why there is no such thing as a black olive, and why The Mill's Master Blender carefully and meticulously supervises each harvest from begin to end.\n\nThe tour takes you into the heart of the operation, the presses.  All olive oil is extracted by mechanical means, keeping its integrity.  In the pressing room, you can sample varieties of olive oils as well as olives.\n\nAfter experimenting for over a decade with different olives, the result is a grove of over a dozen varieties of olives.  Their extra virgin has a distinct flavor due to a few practices inherent in their harvesting.  Olives are harvested by hand (no fallen olives) and cold pressed within 24 hours.  Due to late harvests between the months of September and December, their olive oil has a fruity yet buttery taste.  And you can sample all of their infused oil at the Olive Oil bar. I highly recommend the Meyer Lemon for dipping and cooking, as well as the White Truffle oil.  For baking their Chocolate olive oil and vanilla bean are amazing, and can replace the need for regular vegetable or cooking oils.  The differences in moisture and flavor are astounding!~  There is a reason why they claim that \"you are literally buying one of the best olive oils in the world.\"\n\nAlong with a plethora of cooking oils, there are body care products made with their EVOO.  The body creams leave my skin moist and fresh for nearly a day, the lip balms are also exceptional.\n\nThe cafe has a fresh assortment of sandwiches and salads.  Although the bruschettas look great, they are tiny pieces of extremely dry and crusty bread, the various toppings lacking in freshness and flavor - unfortunately.

We didn't have high expectations as we hadn't heard many things about it but we decided to check it out for ourselves. First of, it is really far; the drive is long & boring as it's out in the middle of no where. When we got there, we came to find that there's not much to see & the time frame for the tours had already ended for the day since they're held earlier.\n\nHowever, we still had a good time that evening. From the eatery, we ordered a pizza & a sandwich, which were both really tasty. Worth mentioning was the Lucca sandwich, which was really unique; I tend to get turkey sandwiches at a lot of places but this one was slightly sweet with the sliced apples & really well balanced with the brie cheese and fig tapenade. I'd definitely get it again! While we were eating our meal & enjoying some gelato, there was a band playing live music. The musician was really good/entertaining that it made it a worthwhile, different experience.\n\nI think it would be fun to go back during the time which there are olive mill tours or other events. We have plans of going back once the weather is cooler!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Being first time visitors here, we weren't sure what to expect.  We stopped by the Olive Mill in Queen Creek yesterday for lunch and were pleasantly surprised!   A large boutique filled with items and foods from local companies and artists.   Dishware, nut butters, chocolates, wines and of course olive oils and vinegars are on display to purchase.   Try sampling their Bacon olive oil, chocolate olive oil and  strawberry balsamic vinegar! ) Lunch and dinner menus,  gelato bar, speciality coffee bar, beers on tap and a dessert counter show their variety of foods they offer.  We were pleased with  our bruschetta bread choices.  Chardonnay Herb Mascarpone, green apple,  Melted Gorgonzola, Genoa salami with Extra Virgin Olive Oil  and the  Burnt mozzarella, Pesto.  The Mascarone was overloaded but the gorgonzola was perfect for me!  The florentine and bacon salad had a wonderful dressing  but a tad to much d for the spinach at the bottom went a a bit limp before I could enjoy it.  The salad  did have a very generous helping of bacon and crisp grapes  that gave it  texture to save it!  Nice roasted garlic on top as well.  The Olive Mill also has a skin care line that is made right on the premises.  I look forward to trying some of those items as well as their soups and other next time I visit!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Great place to come for I unique cuisine & atmosphere.
