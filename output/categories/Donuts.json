Quaint and cozy, lots of comfort foods.  Nothing spectacular, though the homemade breads are quite good.  A bit on the pricey side and can fill-up with people quickly, especially on the weekends.\n\nDetailed review:\nI've lived near C's for about a year now, and have never stopped-in to check it out.  Folks at work gave mixed reviews - some raved about the place, others gave it a \"Meh.\"  I run past it nearly every morning and they always seem to have a good-sized crowd, especially on Saturdays and Sundays, so I figured it had to be somewhat decent... with that, I treated myself to a breakfast this morning.\n\nI wandered in at around 9:30am on Memorial Day and was pleased to find plenty of seating.  The hostess offered me a table outside, which was a nice bonus - the weather was gorgeous, so I happily took the offer.  I also grabbed one of their complimentary/shared newspapers to read.\n\nA waitress stopped by to ask for my drink order - I went with coffee - and to drop off a menu.  She came back a few minutes later with an acrylic coffee cup and a stainless coffee carafe.  She left to tend to another table; I needed some cream for the coffee... oh well, it was nice and I was happy to continue browsing the menu, sans cream for my coffee.\n\nBreakfast offerings were ordinary: eggs, hashbrowns, pancakes, omelets, skillets, and a couple of extras, like eggs benedict, belgian waffles, and some homemade pastries (turnovers, donuts, muffins, cookies, etc).\n\nThe waitress stopped by to ask if I was ready to order - told her I decided on the \"Hen's Nest\" which consisted of 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and toast.  I also ordered a pancake, and requested some cream for the coffee.  She apologized and immediately brought some half-n-half containers.  We were in business.  \n\nBefore leaving to take my order to the kitchen, she asked if I'd like anything in the hashbrowns.  I was pleased!  C's has some specialty hashbrown items on the menu, but I didn't want to order a huge plate of them... so, when the offer surfaced to add onions, peppers, tomatoes, etc to my potatoes, I jumped at the chance.\n\nFood came about 20 minutes later and looked tasty.  The pancake was a lot thinner than I had pictured, but it was quite tasty.  I found myself wishing I had ordered 2.  \n\nThe Hen's Nest was just \"OK\" - the hashbrowns weren't greasy and featured a nice, crispy char,  but the onions and peppers didn't do much for flavor, oddly enough... I found the entire dish to be largely flavorless.  :-(  \n\nThe multigrain toast was very good - and was probably the star of the entire meal.  The waitress only stopped by once more - to drop off the check, which was a bit of a shocker as well... $12 for my modest breakfast - $5.99 for the Hen's Nest, $0.89 for adding extras to the hashbrowns, $2.99 for one (1) pancake (!!!), $1.89 for coffee.\n\nService = 2 stars (nothing great)\nFood = 3 stars (average breakfast fare)\nValue = 1.5 stars (quite pricey for what it was)\nMISC = 3 stars (bakery items looked stellar, nice outdoor patio, very relaxing)\n\nI'd really like to give C's 2.5 stars, but I'm feeling a bit generous so, it's a 3-star \"gift\" rating.  Had I been in a crankier mood, it would've gone 2-stars... :-)\n\nFor what it's worth, I think the Hubbard Avenue Diner has a better overall breakfast, and it's about 1/2 the price.

(This made me happy, as I like meat at breakfast after a night of rainy camping, but am allergic to pork.) The skillet had turkey, potatoes, onions and green peppers mixed together, with toast and 2 eggs on top. The eggs were perfect, which impressed me, given how crazy busy the place was. I do have one complaint about my food 'tho, the onions, peppers and potatoes were not cooked enough for my taste. In fact, the onions were damn near raw. Luckily, they were finely shredded, so it wasn't too bad, but I take away a star for that .\n\n(BF says his potatoes were underdone too. Not raw, but not quite done enough.)\n\nWaitstaff was very good about keeping coffee filled. And, since it was a bakery, we HAD to at least try a cinnamon roll.

To me that's a good thing, even though I'm not big on rhubarb.

They always have samples, which is a bonus! Chocolate chip cookies are one of my specialties, so I'm a tough critic, but theirs are almost addicting (they say customer favorite on the label). The snickerdoodles are great too. I've tried a lot of their cupcake flavors and didn't care for them too much. They're small and the cake is a little dry, but still tasty--especially for gluten free.

It was the first 'real' hamburger I'd been able to have since going gluten-free due to a diagnosed wheat allergy.  The roll was soft, it smelled like bread, it 'crushed' down like a 'real' bun, and it was the perfect proportion of bread to fixins -- every other GF bun I'd tried was this huge mass of dry bread.  I had the same reaction to the awelicious bread -- it smells like bread, it's soft, it's 'real'.  It toasts and grills up great and makes terrific grilled cheese and sandwiches.  But it's actually good and soft enough to eat plain.  This bakery gave me a big piece of my life back. I'm lobbying my husband for a bigger freezer so I can keep more of their stuff in it!  \n\nFavorites are:  Anything awelicious -- bread, hamburger buns, dinner rolls.  The hot dog buns are also terrific.  The cinnamon buns, coffee cake, and cupcakes are divine. I love the banana bread, though honestly it doesn't taste like banana bread to me, but more like a spice bread/cake.  I do love the pizza crust, but wish they'd add one with absolutely NO herbs at all.  Even the Simple crust has herbs in it that alter the taste of the pizza.  A totally plain pizza crust would be fantastic.  \n\nI buy their regular flour and cookie flour to cook with.  And the flours are ENRICHED!!!  I've eaten several of their small chocolate cakes and have liked them all.  I'm totally ordering a custom cake for my birthday -- can't wait!!!  :)  \n\nThey always have samples to try when you go in, which is great.
