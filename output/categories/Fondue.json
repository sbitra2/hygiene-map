Specialty drinks are $5 this night, as well(although I wasn't in love with either of the two I tried). \n\nWe had the Wisconsin Trio for the cheese, which was okay...but nothing fabulous. My friend said that they had the Cheddar Cheese last time, and it was lackluster. I had a nice salad, but nothing I couldn't do at home. We chose the Original chocolate for dessert(a mix of milk chocolate and peanut butter). This was good, but when ISN'T melted chocolate yummy? I do wish that they had given us more fresh fruit and less desserty-stuff to dip. It's not like the picture on the website where it's a heap of bright fruits. There were four small banana slices and about 2-3 strawberries sliced. The rest was pound cake, brownie, marshmallow, rice crispy treat, etc... \n\nAll in all, it was a fun evening, but nothing overly-delicious.

We planned to order dessert but were simply too full. The cheddar cheese fondue was tasty. However, it promised swiss and cheddar, but was quite skewed towards the cheddar. Wine would have made a better ingredient than the beer they use. The house salad with Tangy Sweet dressing was flavorful and fresh. Our entree - the Pacific Rim - offered pork, beef, chicken, shrimp, pot stickers, and even duck. The wide variety of batters and sauces made for nearly infinite combination possibilities.  I hope I can remember next time that I did enjoy the beef by far the best. If the management put their waitstaff in collared shirts they likely could achieve the level of elegance that the decor strives for; the long-sleeved T-shirts seem out of place.

They had a four course meal as the special.  Started out with a cheese dish, we went with the fiesta cheddar.  Tasted pretty good, although we asked for it medium-hot (the server adds jalepeno to taste), and it didn't seem spicy to me at all.  For salad, we got the caprese, which was mainly giant tomato slices with fresh mozzarella- despite being out of season, the tomatoes tasted great.\n\nThe main course was a platter with filet mignon, lobster tail, pork tenderloin, chicken breast, and shrimp (4 pieces of each, although each piece was big enough to be 2 bites).  We went with the coq a vin cooking broth, as it seemed the best for first-timers like us.  The meats came with 7 sauces - butter and lemon for the lobster, cocktail sauce for the shrimp, terayaki, plum sauce, curry sauce, a bleu cheese-like sauce, and a cream cheese-sour cream-chive mixture.  The combination of meats and sauces basically made each bite a different taste - the variety is amazing here.  The only down part was the chicken which seemed a bit dry and flavorless to me.  I was surprised by how good the pork was - I am a steak lover and I think I placed the pork above the filet.\n\nFor dessert we went with the cappuccino milk chocolate.  It came with the vast selection of sweets - bananas, strawberries, pineapple, marshmallows, pound cake, brownies, and cheesecake.  Don't think I could pick a favorite - all were delicious.  We didn't use all the chocolate, but it was still a ton of dessert.\n\nTo go with our meal we got a bottle of chardonnay recommended by the server - probably the best I've had.  Our server was great - he seemed very knowledgeable and friendly.  All in all, we were there for over 2 hours, and it barely felt like that because we were having such a great time.

Most of the time it seems like a Lifetime story.  \n\nI have been a fan of fondue for several years.  While it tends to be more of a special occasion rather than casual occurrence, we have gone twice in the past 3 months.  The first time was in April.  I had been to several Melting Pots before.  I have never been overly impressed by this one in Madison but my husband and I decided to go last April.  Terrible decision.  Apparently, it was THE night to go!  We had 6 o'clock reservations.  We arrived a couple of minutes early.  We waited nearly ten minutes to get seated, all the while walk-in groups and couples were being seated.  \n\nI had to make a point to remind them that we had reservations.  When they finally got around to seating, we were once again seated in an area with \"couple\" types seats.  They are small, awkward and we specifically requested not to be seated there.  However, that was all that available (though we had a reservation).  It is so weird to sit next a person.  This was not our first date.  I was not hear to kiss and cuddle.  I am there to have dinner.  \n\nThe service took so long.  They were clearly understaffed.  However, it got to the point where we were waiting twenty minutes between each course.  I was so turned off by this experience.  On this occasion we went because we had a Groupon so we decided to make a special trip.  We were applied automatic gratuity.  Now, I am a good tipper and if I want to tip 18% for terrible service, I would.  However, I did not want to do this and was extremely upset by this.\n\nUpon returning home, I immediately contacted this location.  I received no response and two weeks later sent another email.  FINALLY, I received a call from a manager.  I did not want anything free, I just wanted acknowledgement.  They were attentive but at the same time really could not care.  Without asking, they sent us a dip certificate.  \n\nSo my husband and I decided to go again.  Just give them the benefit of the doubt.  This time the service was a complete 180!  The hostess was talkative and friendly.  The waiter was prompt and on-time.  We were stuck, again, in those terrible booths.  However, the service was so much better.

We noticed right away that we didn't see any of the usual servers or bartenders and that \"our\" server seemed less than pleasant, something that was NOT the norm from our prior visits. When our cheese arrived, we noticed that the dishes were different, and that broccoli was not on the plates to dip-but we thought that perhaps they were out. When our salads arrived, they were smaller than we remembered them being. We decided to also add the entree portion (not included in Ladies Night pricing) and when the vegetables arrived-there was broccoli! (assuming that in order to cut food costs, the broccoli was omitted from Ladies Night) We finished our meal with the chocolate fondue-all along commenting that none of the servers seemed happy and that our server, while it appeared she only had ours and one other table, was never around-we waited for refills of water as well as drinks-which seemed very unusual to our past experiences when someone seemed to always be around to fill waters (which was not a server-assuming it was another cut back by MP)  At the conclusion of our meal, we took out a Groupon valued at $49 (which was what we paid for it, as the Groupon special had expired, however according to Groupon , expired Groupons can always be used for the face value of which was paid for them)  We had read the rules pertaining to Groupon before presenting it, as it seemed fairly easy-however, the server took one look at it and said \"you have to get what you bought it for!\"...we explained that the deal was expired and now the Groupon was only good for the purchase price, not the $98 value it had once had.  She very reluctantly wrote the information down and left, returning only a few minutes later to say that her manager verified that the Groupon could not be used.  When we asked her to explain why, she staggered and stammered and asked if we would like to speak to the manager...which we did, if only to better understand why the Groupon couldn't be used. The server returned a few minutes later-placing the bill on the table and said \"the manager took your Groupon even though we aren't supposed to!\" and left.  So, no better explanation to why the Groupon couldn't be used and more attitudes from our server and the manager didn't think we were worth a visit to help us to understand...NOT what we wanted! We would have happily paid for our meals without the Groupon; all we had asked for was someone who knew WHY the Groupon couldn't be used to explain it to us so we knew HOW to use it.\nI thought that Melting Pot should know of our experience and how embarrassing and unprofessional our visit was and how this was so unusual, based on the numerous times that we had gone there. I received a reply last night and I did finally have an answer as to the Groupon policy from Owners David & Terri Lenz, followed by the comment that \"I viewed these rules differently than other guests who have purchased them.\" (I am assuming that makes me less intelligent than every other person who purchased them??)   Ok, so I asked for an explanation-and I got it, but what WAS NOT in my reply email from them was anything about our treatment by their server or manager.\nI responded to David & Terri Lenz this morning, making sure that knew that Madison is full of quality restaurants with professional servers, managers and owners and that I will never go to Madison Melting Pot again-it has never been about the amazing food there (it's fondue!), but rather the amazing treatment and fun that used to be protocol for their customers-and based on the fact that Ladies Night used to be packed full and reservations nearly impossible, I did find it interesting that I was able to make same day reservations and when while there I also found it strange that so many tables sat empty-I think that MP has made some very poor decisions in staff changes, in food quantity changes and has alienated more former loyal customers than just me!

Honestly, even at a bare minimum, expect to spend at least three hours there.\n\nWe went for one of the the pre-made combinations called \"The Big Night Out\", since it had everything that we wanted. Filets/Duck/Lobster YUM\n\nThe combinations consist of three courses.\n\n- The Appetizers - a selection of fresh veggies, breads and cheeses with your choice of fondue using a variety of cheeses.  Cheese on Cheese... it's such a delicious crime YUM\n\n-The main course - Consisting of fresh meats(Filets, Chicken, Duck) and possibly seafood(Lobster, Shrimp, etc) depending on which combo you ordered. And your choice of stock.  We went for the coq au vin which is chicken broth with scallions, red wine, etc.\n\n-Desserts - We went for the Yin Yang, which is a variety of brownies,marshmallows (Graham Covered/Oreo Covered) and fruits.  The best part is the fondue consisting of white and dark chocolate arranged into a Yin/Yang symbol.  Awesome presentation.\n\nOur server was extremely helpful as this was our first visit and patiently and humorously explained everything to us.\n\nOne thing that made my eyebrow raise though is the fact that they charged us the full adult price for my 8 year old nephew.   So just be aware of this if you are planning on bringing kids.\n\nIf I recall correctly the combos are about 75$\n\n- Reservations are HIGHLY recommended.  As mentioned earlier,  dinner here takes a few hours, so they can only serve a few groups per night.\n\n- This place is always a great date idea if you want some guaranteed quality time toget to know your partner. (Just make sure you can entertain her/him for the entire 3 hours or else it'll be torture)\n\n- To complement the Yin/Yang dessert, they also have a Chocolate Martini that is also presented in Yin/Yang fashion.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I can't wait to go back here.

I actually had gone to the melting pot three times prior to this. The prior times I had gone were only for appetizers and dessert, and our parties were only the max of four. \n\nMy first two times, I had the cheese appetizer, specifically the Wisconsin trio I believe, was delicious. They offer a variety of breads to try with the cheese, as well as some vegetables. These were great with the cheese selected. \n\nI had tried some mediocre fondue desserts, but this was great! It is offered with either dark chocolate, white chocolate, or both. They give you a plate of fruits, crackers, rice crispy treats, and marshmallows. \n\nAfter these encounters, I never had enough room to fathom eating the main entr\u00e9e plates.  \n\nSo for my boyfriend's dad's b-day, It was the first time for fondue for about 8-10 of us. I know I had really had high expectations for the main course. We ran into some big problems. First, there were only 2 pots for all of us, This caused a lot of fork tangling. The fondue forks were all colliding with each other and everyone had to move their fork when somebody wanted to take his or her own fork out. Second, the two cooking \"methods\" were vastly different from each other and no meat was suited for either of them. The filet mignon was just OK. I mean would you want fried filet mignon? \n\nLastly, we tied up our meal with the dessert fondue, which was absolutely delicious (as expected) \n\nConclusions: Go for the cheese appetizer and chocolate dessert and expect a high price. In a restaurant like this you're paying for the amount of time spent at the table because there is hardly any turnover (our group was there for 2 hours). Skip the entree unless you like pouched or fried meat. The main problem with the food is the cooking method.

They have a meal called a 'Big Night Out' which is a 'course' menu; a cheese fondue, a salad, an entree fondue, and a dessert fondue. When we went the traditional menu was supplemented with an Alpine themed menu, which gives an additional option for the cheese, salad, and dessert course, but we were encouraged to pick and choose what mixes we would like from the traditional menu as well. Quite nice. \n\nWe went with the Alpine menu's cheese and salad course, the court bouillon entree cooking style, and bananas foster dessert. I thought the cheese course was very good. If you opt for the Alpine cheese course be sure to try the pickles in the fondue. It sounds odd but was one of the highlights of the meal. The salad was acceptable but we decided we would probably go with a different choice next time. The entree was fantastic, and the dessert was one of the best we've ever had. We rarely order dessert but it was well worth it here; if you're also the type that usually passes, make this the exception.\n\nAgain, service was excellent. Our waiter was spot on, very polite and attentive. Able to answer all questions and he made some great recommendations.  \n\nI don't recall them having liquor or beer, but they have a very nice wine list.

We ordered the option from their special French themed menu.  It was a mix of Brie and a few other fancy sounding cheeses with bacon and truffle in there.  It was served with the customary bread, apples, and veggies.  This cheese option was just OK.  However, I'm not gonna deduct any stars just because I'm not the biggest fan of the cheeses in this fondue.  I would definitely ask the waiter for a recommendation when it comes to the cheese.  We usually do, however, the guy who took our order didn't seem to have the knowledge/experience of their usual waiters.  He was quickly replaced by a more experienced waiter when our cheese came out.  Apparently, he was a busboy that is training to be a waiter.  Anyway, always ask for a recommendation with cheese.  On previous trips, we had plans to order the special cheese and our waitress recommended against it and offered other choices that were popular.  Try the mexican style cheese fondue it's definitely the best!  Gourmet nachos!\n\nNext came the salads, which also don't disappoint.  My girlfriend and I always order the house salad with house dressings.  So good!  My sister got a caesar and my mom got the house salad with the peppercorn ranch.  They both liked their salads as well.  \n\nAlthough we decided last time not to order entrees, because it was just too much food, we still got them this time.  You have to get the Coq au Vin oil/seasoning/broth mixture to cook your entree in.  It is by far the best option.  On all of our other trips, we would get the mojo which is a citrus/caribbean option.  The broth makes all the difference because it alters the flavor of every dish.  The mojo is good, but only if you don't mind the citrus flavor in every dish.  We ordered two of the special fondue fushion options.  This is the best option if you are interested in ordering all four courses, because it comes with more choices on your entree plate and costs about the same as ordering a la carte.  It came with lobster, filet mignon, ny strip steak, chicken, duck l'orange, shrimp, and these little raviolis.  Every single option was delicious and well marinated/seasoned.  The sauces also go better with the entree options when you use the Coq au Vin.\n\nLast but not least, we got the original chocolate fondue.  There's not much to say, but this is perfection.

To start, we had their Spinach and Artichoke Cheese Fondue made of Fontina and Butterkase Cheeses, perfect for the kids.  It is accompanied with fresh bread, apples, and vegetables.  The second course is their salad course.  We chose their Shrimp Ceviche w/Avocado Salad...tasty, but a bit on the over-dressed, tangy side.  Next was the entree course.  We requested the Lobster Indulgence which included 2 tails, NY strip, chicken provencal, white shrimp, duck a l'orange, and a ravioli (or potsticker).  If that isn't enough, you can order more a la carte.  We chose the Mojo fondue which is a citrus, garlic and cilantro flaired bouillon w/Caribbean seasonings.  Had the kids not been there, I would have opted for the more traditional Coq Au Vin fondue...always love me some red wine!  And of course, lastly, the dessert fondue!  Dark chocolate w/a bit of dulce de leche and a sprinkle of Fleur de Sel, or sea salt.  Truly decadent!  Choices to dip?  Strawberries, bananas, pound cake, brownies, cheesecake, rice krispie treats, and oreo-crusted and graham cracker-crusted marshmallows, were all inhaled within minutes...mainly by the children, of course.  Did I mention that this place is a perfect family restaurant?\n\nTheir wine list is also amazing, nationally recognized as one of the best in any national restaurant chain.  Mommy & Daddy were able to say *C*H*E*E*R*S* w/a bottle of Old World Red, 2005 Rioja Reserva, Marquesde Riscal.  Very smooth!\n\nService is upscale and very friendly.

The evening is fantastic, it takes about 2.5 hours or more, and it's a great pace.  You are never in a rush, and it's certainly a different way to dine.\n\nSo, when we went to Melting Pot last night, I was troubled to learn that the menu had changed.  The Big Night Out which we had shared so many times was gone, replaced with a more a la carte ordering system.  You order by the person now, still having to share the cheese and dessert courses with the table as a whole.  Already, I was annoyed by the change in the menu.  THEN, I open the wine list to find fewer than 10 wines by the glass in white, even fewer in red, and only a page of wines period.  This is much, much less than Melting Pot used to have. I pointed this out to our server, and she informed me I was correct, the wine list had been paired down significantly.  Apparently the decision was made to simplify things.  Of course, I imagine stocking pricier bottles was not paying off, and I certainly understand a restaurant needing to make changes based on the bottom line.  But, it certainly affected my meal and will affect my decision whether to come in the future.\n\nThe meal was a solid Melting Pot meal.  We had the Wisconsin trio, an excellent blend of cheeses.  We asked our server to go heavy on the blue cheese and garlic, and she obliged in spades.  Excellent flavor.  The cajun platter and lobster fusion were next, and while good, the meat course left a little to be desired.  I feel like the portions are smaller, but I can't prove this.  I will say the shrimp was the favorite meat, and that's saying something when we ordered a dish with steak and lobster.  A tip if you eat here, put the mushrooms and potatoes in IMMEDIATELY.  The potatoes still weren't completely cooked by the end of the meal.  That's always been an issue with Melting Pot.  I would think there is a way to fix it, but I haven't seen it yet.\n\nThe dessert was the star of the meal.  We had the white chocolate creme brulee.  White chocolate with caramelized sugar drizzled on top.  Excellent, very glad we tried the special dessert.  My favorite in meals past was always the main course, but today it was the desserts.

This was our first time visiting this location.  Luckily we were able to make our reservations pretty close to last minute.  \n\nArriving, we were greeted by the most monotone girl who wasn't happy to be working New Years Eve.   I get it but at least crack a smile.   We were seated immediately but as I sat down, there was a dirty napkin still on the seat.  Hmm.   I had to hand that to the girl right away.  Looking closer at our table, it was still dirty and needed cleaned.  Yuck. Even after we left, our jackets had 'leftover' food on them from the unclean table area.  Not really happy about that. \n\nOur waitress was shortly over to our table explaining the special menu they had for the evening. \nAfter making our choices and drink orders, she was back quickly to prepare our cheese fondue.  Absolutely delicious.  It had a nice blend of cheese, onion and bacon flavors combined.  This was served with rosemary and french breads, apples and veggies.   It's always great dipping each of these into the cheese blends.   \n\nThe salads were also delicious.   Pear with crumbled blue cheese and almonds tossed in a vinaigrette.   Fabulous.   It was small but you really didn't need anything larger with all of the food yet to come.  \n\nThe entree was loaded with cracked pepper filet, bbq pork,  honey chicken, mahi maui, jumbo prawns and gorgonzola saccetti.  You could add lobster tail for $15 but this was definitely enough food already.   The entree was mouth watering.  Plus the entree is served with potatoes, broccoli and mushrooms.   Yum!\n\nWith all of that food in our stomachs, there was still the mint chocolate fondue to devour.   Their chocolate fondues are accompanied by a plate of various desserts to dip including rice krispy treats, brownies, marshmallows and fruit.   I really shouldn't have eaten it but it sure was tasty!  \n\nDuring our meal, our waitress wasn't really up to par.  My husband had ordered a drink which must have slipped her mind.

They opened at 5pm.\n\nWe have been here a few times before and knew exactly what we wanted so we ordered everything right when we sat down.  We did not have any questions about the menu--our order was very simple and straight forward.  Two iced teas and two house salads w/ tangy dressing.  We ordered the pick three for two with all Teriyaki Sirloin, 1 order of sausage, (which was 4 slices) and extra potatoes.\n\nHalf way through the meal our server asked if we would be doing the chocolate course? We weren't sure at that time so we said No.  He said \"I will be right back w/ your check.\"  A few minutes later he dropped the bill.  We weren't even done cooking all of our meat.  I usually decide if I want dessert when I am finished with my meal not halfway through the main course.  I understand there may be some extra prep work and they would like to know about dessert so they can get going on it.  No need to drop the bill so prematurely especially because the place wasn't even busy. Maybe he was mad we weren't raking up a huge bill.  We have done the Big Night out option a few times before and learned exactly what we do and don't like.

It really irritates me to feel rushed like that.  We finished cooking the last pieces of meat and got a to-go box for them.  The time my bill was printed was 6:02pm.(see pics) We were there maybe 40min. max start to finish.  40 min. is quick for The Melting Pot which is supposed to be a \"slow paced\" dining experience.\n\nThe food was really good.  Teriyaki Sirloin has lots of juicy flavor. Love the 6 different sauce selections and the garlic salt. The salad size has decreased since the last time we visited.
