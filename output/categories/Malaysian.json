While I like the cosy atmosphere at the original venue, it's also nice to be in a big space with plenty of room for diners and servers to navigate their way around each other. And nicer toilets too (I'm sure I shouldn't mention toilets at the beginning of a restaurant review. Are you hungry yet?)\n\nHowever this nice airy room wasn't designed for this restaurant, as the Sistine Chapel ceiling and huge painting of the Bay of Naples attest. But it just added to the quirky atmosphere I expected from the original place, as did the big gift-wrapped fridge (we never quite worked out what that was all about).\n\nThe food is the same as the original restaurant, a large menu of all sorts of Malaysian specialities, from safe stir fries familiar to most diners to whole fish (head, tail and all) and even pig's maw. It's an interesting mix between exotic authenticity (I assume, having never been to Malaysia) and inoffensive Asian food for the less adventurous. So there's something for everyone here. You can get chilli chicken with noodles or go for more interesting options with pickled or fermented condiments or anything in between. The new menu also indicates which dishes have the bone left in. Newcomers will want to know that this doesn't necessarily mean just chicken wings or drumsticks. Even a chicken stir fry or soup will container hunks of meat broken up with a cleaver so be prepared for mouthfuls of assorted bone bits and splinters. \n\nPersonally, I find their laksa too thin and not creamy enough, but that's just personal preference. I usually go for the \"dry\" dishes with rice or noodles, but the one thing I always get is the perennial favourite roti cenai for a starter. Fried roti bread (fluffy and creamy almost like pancakes) with a medium-spiced creamy curry dipping sauce (I find Malaysian curries to be the perfect blend of spicy Indian styles and the creamy coconut-based Thai varieties). Unbeatable. The chicken wings are also particularly good. Sometimes I have to have more than one starter because there are too many good options, and I can't forego the roti cenai. \n\nIt's cheap and cheerful but also delicious. An excellent place for group meals with a fun no-frills atmosphere and lots of dishes you can share. They do BYO (\u00a33 corkage for wine and I think over a pound per beer) but you can buy bottled beer or wine by the glass at reasonable prices.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Cheap and cheerful.

Just the right amount of spiciness and bite sized chunks of chicken thigh. Yummy comfort food. \nMy friend went for a bowl of prawn noodles and it was well on flavour.\nWe also shared a dish of prawn sambal malaysian style. Vegetables in this dish were aubergine, green beans and okra. I have been suspicious of okra.. mainly as it has a bit of a 'slimey reputation'. Perhaps it depends on the way it's cooked, go figure. Anyway when my friend who is actually Chinese Malaysian, casually remarked that okra is good for collagen I grabbed a piece and it was just fine. I later googled more about this superfood and indeed okra contains a lot of C-vitamin which is good for collagen production.\n\nBesides of okra, I also tried another new thing: teh tarik, which is known as 'pulled tea'. So basically it's black tea and condensed milk. Personally I found it too sweet but I was glad to have had sampled this.\n\nI will definitely go back to Kampung Ali.

It's like a crispy pancake that melts in your mouth and it comes with a slightly spicy peanut curry sauce. It's the beez kneez.

This is so flavourful. I love it. \n\nNumber 4: Lemon chicken. You know how sometimes you can order lemon chicken and it's over cooked and dry? Yeah, that doesn't happen here. The lemon chicken was so moist and it was a fairly large portion! \n\nNumber 5: Get some duck and coconut rice!\n\nI think that Kampung Ali is a great when you come with a group of people - so you can sample many things off the menu. Wine is also very reasonably priced. A good bottle of South African wine is 13 pounds. \n\nThe service is impeccable.

Overall, a somewhat disappointing dish due to the overcooking of the prawns.\n\nThe Singapore Noodles is a type of chow mein, with thin egg noodles.
