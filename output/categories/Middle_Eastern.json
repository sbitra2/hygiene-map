I could have used the bread while I was sitting there STARVING, waiting for my order to be taken.  I had to go up front and ask for ketchup for my fries - I got handed packets.. ummm ok.

Total hole in the wall on East Wash in a strip mall behind some Mexican buffet, with the name People's Bakery, you'd never guess this place would have the best Middle Eastern food in Madison.  \n\nStart with the wife of the wife and husband team, who greets you warmly as you come in.  The menu is on the wall, but there are hard copies for those who need an explanation of the nicely blended mix of Lebanese, Armenian and Syrian dishes.  No matter your experience with food of the Middle East or Mediterranean, you'll find dishes you recognize, perhaps by different names.\n\nThis was my first visit, I'm sitting here eating my takeout order as I type this because it's that good.  I ordered the lentil soup, and several appetizer portions including hummus, moohamara, sarma, and falafel.    \n\nQuick review:\n- lentil soup.  Awesome, just awesome.  Beautiful saffron color from the cooked down red lentils, just the right mix of cumin and lemon, and a back end of heat, I'm guessing from Aleppo pepper.  This is some thick soup, and filling, and for 2.50, you get a pint\n\n- Moohamara.  I wasn't going to get this.  I like roasted red bell pepper, and I've had dips and purees made of them, but I've never sought it out.  Mary, one of the owners, told me it was her favorite, best on the menu.  And holy COW was she right.  A smack of roasted red pepper is quickly deepened by a sweet hit of pomegranate and walnuts, ubelievably complex and wonderful.\n\n- Falafel.  Huge portion, perfectly deep-fried, with a really nice, light texture.  Love the falafel, but I prefer tahini sauce, and these come with a yogurt mint sauce.  Don't get me wrong, this is clearly their regional interpretation, Im all about the authentic experience, and this was good sauce.  But, I confess that for my leftovers I'm making some tahini sauce.\n\n- Hummus.  You know, hummus is always a crap shoot for me.  I make my own, from dried chick peas, and I've been working on this recipe for 25 years (along with my Bloody Mary recipe and about a hundred others). This is another of those regional interpretation issues, this was my least favorite today.  I'll try it again, because my own hummus has on and off days.  This was just more on the bland side than I expected,  No one distinct flavor dominated so I felt like it was left with an almost indescribable flavor.  Not bad, totally edible, just oddly unflavored.  I added some lemon and salt, which helped some.  \n\nSarma - if you're expecting dolmathes this will be familiar in flavor, but it texture.  These are served cold with a yogurt dipping sauce.  I'm okay with the temperature, but I just like a little lemon on mine.  These are veg, the rice filling is cooked down to a coarse 'risotto-y' consistency.  I dig them, but those who prefer the snap of dolmathes will find these softer, but just as flavorful\n\nAll in all, outstanding.

Aggressive herbal flavors perfectly matched with a spike of lemony acidity.  My wife LOVED her falafel sandwich...which is really saying something, as she's somewhat of connoisseur.

It's a kitschy, little greasy spoon nestled into a strip mall at the corner of East Wash and East Johnson.  There's not a lot of seating and if someone is on the phone, you're going to be privy to their conversation.  In my case, I got a comprehensive update on a bedbug infestation of a family member that the owner's wife was describing in painstaking detail.  And while the chairs and tables are mismatched and the floor tiles are coming loose in places, the eating surfaces were all impeccably clean and the pictures on the wall gave the joint a homey feel.  And the husband and wife team that run the place have a great rapport with the regular customers getting their lunch fix. \n\nI ordered the $5.50 gyros and fries and grabbed a seat.  About ten minutes later, a massive foil wrapped gyros was delivered to my table.  I swear that an entire herd of sheep were sacrificed for this meal.  In terms of quantity, the People's Bakery delivered big time.  \n\nOn the quality side, things were a little less clear cut. First the negatives:\n* The next time I visit, I'm going to ask to have the pita spend a little time on the grill.  This dish deserves better than a cold, doughy pita.\n* More tzatziki sauce please!!!  When you give me a metric ton of lamb meat, I need more than a tablespoon of sauce to balance out the dish.\n* The same can be said of the tomatoes.  I need more than two very thinly cut slices.\n\nNow the positives:\n* The meat was served piping hot, moist and well seasoned.  It was clear this meat wasn't sitting under a heat lamp awaiting the lunch time crush.  The only thing I would have changed is to have a little char on some of the pieces to provide more textural contrast.\n* The onions served with the dish were pure awesomeness.  I'll be honest, I usually pick most of the onions off my gyros because they can overpower the other ingredients with their sulfuric pungency.  With a medium dice, these onions were fresh and sweet and complemented each bite.\n* I l-o-v-e-d the fries that accompanied the meal.  Salty and crunchy on the outside and hot and moist on the outside.   Yummmmmm.\n\nSo, does the People's Bakery unseat Trader Gus as my King of Madison Gyros.  I say it's too close to call right now.

Thank you Yelp, for helping us find a really incredible place to eat.  We got here about 10 minutes before they were about to close, and it kind of felt like they didn't want to take any new customers.  I would have been more understanding if I had actually known they were about to close - we thought they were going to be open for several more hours.  We were eyeballed for a few minutes with no one coming to talk to us, but then were seated after a few minutes of waiting.\n\nImmediately the four of us went after the Shish sampler for 4, though we were worried that there might not be enough food.  Fear not, fellow Yelpers.  If you come in a group of 4, I highly recommend it.  There was so much food, and the waitress (I believe who was the owner's wife) helped us out by spacing out the food into all the appetizers and the entrees.  \n\nI will say, that they could improve the bread.  I wish it was a bit more doughy, and softer as well - it's kind of hard to eat when it all just crackles when you take a bite.  But, it's the only thing I'd change.  The spices on each dish were great though I've forgotten much of what I've eaten.  I did enjoy the hummus and falafel in particular on the appetizers side.\n\nThe entrees were lamb chops and chicken and steak kabobs.  My God, I've never had lamb like that before.  It was incredible.  And, as a point of pride for our table, we polished off every bit of food.  I think the owner may have heard us talking about the show Man vs. Food, where the guy on the show does all these food challenges, but he came out at the end of the meal, thanked us for coming and said he was proud of us eating everything.  He gave us a $10 gift certificate to use on a future date, and joked (I think) that he'd give us $20 if we finished everything a second time.\n\nTruly a great place, I would love to go back.  They ended up locking the doors after us, about an hour after they officially closed - we were never rushed once.  Serious hospitality.  I was thinking about the star system and was about to go 4, but honestly, for Madison, it had to be a 5 star place.  I had been to too many mediocre to decent places in Madison, but this joint redeemed the town.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 6, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "I love Middle Eastern food and I live on the west side, so I'm disappointed I avoided this place for so long. I even passed by it several days a week for a while. The lousy outward appearance did keep me from dropping by on a whim, but luckily once I found the reviews on Yelp I knew I had to go. (Side note: they have a 'People on Yelp love us' sticker on their window and a posted letter from Yelp congratulating them on the 5 star reviews, so if you get close enough you'll figure out they do rock). \n\nSadly, the location on University Ave annoys the crap out of me! I just want there to be a direct route through all of that residential area between University and Mineral but the only way is to get down to Whitney. Pretty weak, I know, since it only adds 5 minutes on a bad day.\n\nAnyway, let's get to the food! \n\nFirst went to lunch and got the Shish Kafta (ground lamb skewer) with hummus (stir in the spices they sprinkle on top) and tabbouleh. Delicious, delicious tabbouleh.  Always remember with Indian and Middle Eastern: apart it's good, together it's fantastic so MIX! (eat them together, don't stir it up with your spoon, nub). Most meals come with some pita for the table which is actually a bit bland until you add some of the tasty seasoning mix you'll find on the table. Also got some Arabic coffee. The cardamom was a welcome taste to the coffee, just know that Arabic coffee has the grounds in the bottom of the pot, so when you get to the end of your cup, don't take a big swig. It's so rich anyway, you probably wouldn't do that. I don't really call myself a coffee drinker, but I enjoyed it. Too stuffed to try the baklava.\n\nThen I went back to dinner with my sister, her bf, and his sister. YOWZA! Dinner dishes are always more expensive, but the broad selection of entrees and appetizers is fantastic. There are even a number of seafood options which we did not partake in. From the top:  Arabic coffee: Not for everyone (I still like it!). Jibne is absolutely delicious fried cheese and it will squeak like a good cheese curd. Not that you'll want to go back to cheese curds after this, frankly. The Shish Sampler for two...can definitely feed three. And you won't need any rice in any other dishes if you're sharing.The mouhamara is too strong of a pepper flavor for me to eat in large amounts (pureed red pepper) but was appreciated greatly by others at the table. The Mediterranean noodles plate was surprising (Middle Eastern doesn't make me think noodles) but very tasty (and vegetarian) as a complement to the rest of the dishes (we were sharing) but would be too much of the same flavor/texture if I were ordering for just myself. Still too stuffed to try the baklava.\n\nBottom line: I don't think you can go wrong here. Pick something off the menu that looks good and you'll have a great meal. And if it isn't everything you were hoping for right away, it probably will be once you apply hummus and yogurt sauce. \n\nIf you don't k now where to get started:\nTry the Arabic coffee if you like rich coffee, get the Jibne appetizer if you like cheese (if doing dinner), then go for the Shish Kafta with hummus and with each bite combine 2 or more of the components on the plate (lamb kafta or veggies, yogurt sauce, tabbouleh, hummus).", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "My family got together here last weekend for a celebration of my son's graduation from law school and my wife's birthday.

Now about the food and drink: hummus was great and the crunchy pita crackers were fine when we could get more of them. Wine choices were limited, but we liked the Romanian cabernet, offered at a reasonable $22/bottle. We had the Shish Feast for 6. The lamb chops were way overdone. Rice was good.

And, what used to look like a pretty daunting restaurant (I mean, with the Hookah Lounge tag on the name and the rather imposing storefront), has become like a coffee shop or diner for us...and that's mostly a good thing.\n\nI like the huge menu, and the ability to pick from Italian, Persian, Greek, and Indian (albeit only 3 choices) selections.  On Wednesdays, it's 25% off your entire tab, a great value!  Not being subscribers of local papers and always tossing out the ad-paks that come in the mail, I haven't seen all the 'coupons' mentioned by others.  So what about the food?\n\nDecent job of the Chicken Curry - and the spice-to-taste option is great.  My 10-yr old enjoys it mild; I love it spiced to the max!  She wishes they put potatoes in the curry, but with the wonderful rice-bed that the curry sits on, I think she can live without the potatoes.  Maybe some veggies (besides the cursory onions) would make it a little more interesting, but hey, this isn't the Red Velvet Vegan Cafe (just down the street a bit).\n\nPaymon's Greek platters are also good - Gyros platter, Baked Kibbe platter, etc.  I wish the Kibbe wasn't quite as \"moist\", and retained more of the beef texture, but it's still quite good.  I think the Athens Fries is a bit overrated - a little too salty for my taste.  I also enjoy the Fesenjan (Chicken breast cuts in a slightly tart/sweet yummy pomengranate sauce), but it wasn't to my wife's liking.  Your experience will very much vary depending on how you take to the specific spices used in each dish, so ask the server to elaborate.\n\nThe service is good, almost family-like, unless they are packed.  Then, a certain level of panic seems to set in, and it becomes hard to flag down your server.  Funny - I still like restaurants where the person who took your order is the same person who brings your food.  Sometime about 10 years ago, I think most \"big box restaurants\" adopted a serving method where someone more junior and less experienced than the person who took your order always brings out the food...and you lose the chance to question the food at the moment it arrives.  That is definitely a pet peeve of mine...especially when your original server who heard your specific requests doesn't come around until at least 5-10 minutes after another person has dropped the plates of food in front of you!  Annoying!  BUT...this doesn't happen at Paymon's!\n\nPortions are large enough that I don't recall having room for dessert yet at Paymon's.  All in all, Paymon's is a handy restaurant to have close by.  They stay open to 11 pm every night, so no rushing down by 8 pm to try and make it.

Puree of chickpeas, Tahini, fresh garlic, olive oil and fresh lemon juice. \n\nBABA GANOSH\nThe name speaks for it self, it sounds like a hot Greek man riding on a white horse down the white sands of Greece....but it is a scrumptious mixture of seasoned, baked eggplant, blended with Tahini, fresh garlic, Olive oil and fresh lemon juice.\n\nTABULI SALAD\nWhat a fresh Mediterranean classic of a salad! Tabuli salad is combined with chopped parsley, bulgur wheat, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and fresh mint leaves. Tossed with their house seasonings, extra virgin Olive oil and fresh lemon juice.  I know I know...it has gluten in it, but it's already hard to be gluten free so I ate it anyway!

Margaritas were ridiculously too sweet, and i read through the ingredients. They use a mix i have used before, so i'm not sure how those got screwed up... and I'm a bartender. \nNext, we ordered the hummus as a starter, and it arrived surprisingly fast.

We figured oh well, the entrees should make up for it.\nI ordered the gyro pita, accompanied by athens fries, my boyfriend got the pesto pizza. I couldn't pick up the thing, cuz it would probably fall apart, so i proceeded to make little mini pitas by tearing pieces of it and putting the meat, tomato, onion and tzatziki sauce inside, very messy. I now realize that we were never given settings or napkins.

I then got on here and learned that happy hour pricing was only on Tuesday nights. Another thing i came across in these reviews was that Weds nights are customer appreciation night and they take 25% off the final check.  Again, didn't happen.\nWe were over it at this point and just wanted to vacate. Again, my boyfriend had to go looking for our server,  who he said gave him an irritated look when we needed change.

We also ordered a bowl of the Cherry Bomb shisha, which I thought tasted a lot better, more flavorful.  \n\nThere was a lot of funky music playing, and the music videos for the songs were also on the TVs on the walls.

They have a huge assortment of hookah flavors - at least 25 that you can mix and match, and you can also choose liquids other than water for the bottom of the hookah. My only complaints are that the hookahs take phenomenally long to come out (I can never understand why this part takes so long - the drinks and even the food arrives before the hookah!) and they won't refill coals - you just have to order a new hookah flavor. But, the music is good and the seating is comfortable, so the wait doesn't bother me enough to stop going.\n\nThe food is good, but not exceptional. It's decent middle eastern food for Las Vegas, but like I said, if it weren't for the great vibe in the hookah lounge, I wouldn't go for the food alone. The hummus, baba ganoush, and meat dolmas are my favorite appetizers, and the lamb skewers are a great entree. I wouldn't recommend going to this place for dinner, but I would hands-down recommend going to have a fun night smoking hookah and grabbing some drinks with friends.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I read some of the negative reviews and I'm convinced they must have had an off night.

The tomatoes you could tell had been refrigerated for a while as they had no taste except to be slightly sour with a mealy texture. The feta was dry and grated which was very strange to me. I prefer a creamier, softer feta, the kind that comes packed in water. I usually associate dry feta with poor quality.

How does a restaurant with so many reviews and such high ratings manage to serve food like this?  You can tell that there was no love or time put into our dishes; the chicken tasted like it was prepared minutes before (Chewy as hell), the curry sat under the heat lamps (the surface of the curry sauce was wrinkled and dry) and was insanely flavorless, and my dolmas were loaded with a dry type of meat, no rice, and largely tasted like grape leaves.\n\n-Environment on dining side was okay.

The owner who is Israeli and definitely loud and proud about his restaurant immediately asked if we've been here before and we told him \"no\". He then gave my sister and me a falafel ball topped with a dollop of houmos to try out exclaiming that it was the best in the world. I've never particularly liked falafel since it's a vegetarian item and I need my meat but I'll admit it helped whet my appetite! \n\nWe ended up ordering the Sababa Special, which the establishment touts as the \"Ultimate Pu Pu Platter.\" For $17.95, it came with falafel, houmos, kababs, pita bread, shawarma, and salad. It was alright and the portion seemed small at first, but I got full off it even though I had to share with my sister. We also ordered a four piece appetizer thing that came with some bourekas and other stuff. I would have liked the houmos to have been less salty and the shawarma to have been beef (they don't have lamb here) rather than chicken. \n\nThe service was also pretty good since the workers were pretty attentive. This place is like a hybrid of sorts since it's not entirely fast food but it's also not exactly a sit-down establishment either. You need to order at the counter but you have the option of paying upfront or after you finish eating and must pay at the counter regardless. They bring the food to you and they come to you to ask if you need drink refills but there are no designated servers.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "awesome falafel!", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "This is my go-to place for kabobs and falafel.

Baba Ganoush, red & white cabbage, a Moroccan salad made with cucumber, tomatoe, red onion & spices, an awesome spicy eggplant relish & some& other tasty stuff.\n\nWe all had different entree's so I had a chance to try some of everything & everything simply rocked!  The falafel was smaller than I'm used to but extra crispy & then creamy on the inside. The kabobs were made with some of the tastiest, juiciest meat I've had in some time, was seasoned perfectly & BBQ'd to perfection.  The chicken shawarma, simply epic.  I could eat one of their chicken shawarma laffa sandwiches (aka burrito) every day & never get tired of it.  The fish balls were tender & tasty & the rib-eye, freaking unreal!\n\nYou can tell it's authentic kosher food just by their regulars on hand.  The jewish community in N. Vegas flock to this place & finding a table wasn't easy.  So it's a little of the beaten path (15 minutes from the strip)  a total hole in the wall, kinda slow service & the (almost) deal killer...NO beer, wine or other alcohol served there.

The larger plate had a good-sized portion of chicken pieces.  They were tasty, but I swear, I couldn't tell whether they were dark or white meat.  This was accompanied by a large helping of rice covered with pinto beans in sauce (we could have chosen green beans as a topping).  The smaller plate had Israeli salad - basically chopped and seasoned cucumber and tomato - along with baba ganouche, hummus, and a red cabbage salad that was scrumptious.  A third plate had four mini pitas (more upon request).  The idea was to pull off pieces of the the pita and make little mini sandwiches with all the ingredients.  Luckily, I was there with a native, to teach me the ropes and translate the waitress, Gila, who's also the cook and owner, with her husband.  Gila speaks English, but obviously preferred to converse with my friend in Hebrew.\n\nMy friend bought a box of pastries - Gila made - to take home, but we snacked on them for dessert.

Surprised by the fact that she said that they were closed, I replied, \"Oh, you're closed?\"  Her reply to me (in an even more irritated tone) again was, \"WHAT YOU WANT?\"  Appalled by her sheer rudeness, I calmly responded with \"Nothing from here.\", turned around and walked right out the door.

Stephano's is the official Endorsed Hookah Lounge of Matt C. Let me break it down for ya:\n\nHookah\n---\nStephano's does a good hookah. Period. It's priced fairly, and usually lasts 2+ hours. Hookahmaster General Nick (a title I just invented) is an avid smoker, and takes pride in his work. He's often working on new tweaks for better smoking, and can wax poetic on things like shisha quality, etc. But, what initial got me coming back to Stephano's was the smoking quality/time/money ratio. Paymons' can make a good hookah too, but they never last over an hour. For the same money, you can smoke for hours at Stephano's, plus the refills are cheaper.\n\nFood\n---\nI like it, and most people I bring enjoy it also. It's not super-cheap, but I never feel like I've overpaid either. My personal favorites are the gyro pizza and the gyro bowl. It's not on the menu, but they also serve edamame, which is the perfect hookah nosh. Their beer menu is also pretty strong, and well priced.\n\nAmbiance\n---\nThis is something else I really like about Stephano's - it's casual atmosphere. It's a relaxed environment, and I don't feel conspicuous if I'm  sitting there alone. They have regular height tables up front, which are great if you wanna work on something while you're smoking, and a banquette'd lounge-area in the back (great for dates).

If you're looking for a dark, super-romantic place though, it might not be the first choice. I will say that my FLF prefers the environ of Stephano's over all the other like establishments I've taken her. \n\nService\n---\nFood wise, it's served at a counter, kinda fast-food-style. But if you're smoking, you get waiter service along with it. There's usually only one person doing all the serving/hookah-tending, so it occasionally gets slow, but It's a family business, so you get the plus'es and minuses of that. Nick especially is good about keeping coals tended properly. Owing to the family business thing, I was able to get the aforementioned edamame on the menu quite easily. I don't know about you, but I really like a place that caters to its customers. \n\nConclusion\n---\nI like it here, a lot.\n\nThe 5 is comparative to local competition. I don't like giving 5's, and Stephano's isn't perfect, but it's the best I've found in Las Vegas.\n\nThere you have it.\n\nPRO-TIP: Edamame + hookah = win\nPRO-TIP: Hookah service starts at 5.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 5, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "The only thing I can really say about this place is that it's just okay.\n\nThe prices are pretty darn fair, and you get a decent amount of food as well.

The pitas were far too dry and tasteless, so they served solely as a vehicle for the mediocre dips. The garlic sauce on my shawerma was very strange...I didn't hate it with a vengeance like other yelpers did, but I honestly couldn't decide if I liked it or not.\n\nThe interior was decent and cozy, but definitely had the \"college hangout\" vibe.

At first glance it looks like a paltry amount of sliced Gyro meat, but looks are deceiving.  There is plenty of meat to create a nice balance with all of the other salad ingredients which include:  fresh and bright green romaine lettuce, Roma tomatoes, a generous amount of crumbled feta cheese, Greek olives, and overly substantial amount of sliced raw white onions (note:  sizes of onion slices are also overly substantial).  The salad is also served with 2 grilled pitas, so it's not a light meal.\n\nI recommend the salad; the dressing is basic but good with red wine vinegar and dried oregano as dominating flavors.  The gyro meat is grilled which is a nice touch, because like 99% of all gyro joints, Stephano's  uses the factory processed gyro force meat that tends to be salty, but the grilling cuts down on the saltiness.  They also take the time grill the pita bread and it makes a world of difference in the flavor and is much appreciated.\n\nStephano's only gets 3 stars from me for many reasons.  The prices are pretty high for a quick lunch place, my lunch was around $9.00 and there wasn't much to the preparation.  There was no perception of value, especially since it caters to people on a students' budget.  The amount of raw onions were insane.  I love raw onions but even after picking most of them off, I could feel the sulphurous onion essence seeping from my pores.  I'm going to class for the next 5 hours and I feel bad for those that have to sit around me.  Another thing that is hurting the star rating of Stephano's is the fact that they use those annoying pagers to notify you that your order is ready.

But, if you're ordering a plate with hummus or been-there-done-that, I'd recommend baba ganoush as another option.\n\nFeta with Olives side- 4-stars- A beautiful, briny dish also served with it's own batch of pita bread. (I hear the wheat pita is the best, as one man exclaimed.) The huge, purplish Kalamata olives are so sweet and salty, with very small seeds. It was just a satisfaction biting into these. The feta was also brisk and briny. It was almost too much salt for one dish, but eating them with a pita helped to spread the distinct flavors out a little.\n\nFalafel Plate- 4-stars- Served with five falafels, the spices hit you immediately. The falafel were a little drier, yet also crispier than I've been accustomed to. There is a light coating of tzatziki to add some moisture. The Israeli salad is a mixture of cucumber, tomato, onion, and cilantro almost like a salsa. Amazingly, the flavor and freshness reminded me of a lomi lomi in Hawaii (without the seafood obviously). My suggestion, as you also get pitas with this plate--add the salad into the pita, then pack on some hummus to keep all the loose pieces together. Throw on the falafel last, then enjoy the mixture of flavors as they hit your taste-buds. The plate is huge, and all three was more than enough to stuff me beyond capacity. Yet, I didn't feel weighed down, which is a good thing. Healthy and delicious!\n\nAtmosphere- The set-up is very open and casual, with light music playing in the background. Check out the seats in the rear of the restaurant if you want a more intimate feel while you're eating--with pillows, etc. rather than wooden seats. The decorations are light, but there is a nice bookshelf dedicated to the beers they carry. Wi-fi is also available, yet secured, so I guess you gotta ask for the password--there was no info on the receipt nor the buzzer they give you with your order. I did find it amusing, there was sriracha sauce available as a hot sauce. I don't know if it's made it all the way to Greece, or the local clientele just loves it, but sriracha is definitely a good, comforting sign of discriminating tastes.\n\nService- Service is very casual and friendly. You do get a buzzer when your order is ready, and it's picked up on the side window away from where you make your order. Beyond this, you don't really speak to the servers.\n\nConclusion- Definitely a quiet, humble place, just a hop-skip-and-a-run across the street from UNLV. It seems to attract both student and staff, especially with the variety of options between beer and wi-fi and sriracha (still amazed to see this sauce there). It does lack some excitement and pizzazz, but I'm sure that comes in often enough from the front doors.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "got the number 6.

Didn't know what I was getting in to, and it seems this place is in-tune with social media like Yelp and Groupon--smart of them!\n\nFirst of all, walked in 10 minutes before closing...My wife and I are not the type of people to push the envelope--I understand closing times and if the people working who had been on their feet all day didn't want to deal with me, I'd understand--there were a plethora of other restaurants in the area we could have gone to another place nearby.

What the hell? That's service. (And he knew I was an out-of-towner, not like he was winning over a customer that can come by once a week).\n\nA few minutes past 9, as he was walking to the front door to lock it and turn off the 'open' sign, he explicitly mentioned to us, \"I am closing up, but please take your time--no rush!\" (Not sure if I've ever had that at a small, counter-service restaurant like this before).

The atmosphere is very relaxed they have a great selection of beer and alcohol and it's in a great location.\n\nSome of my favorites that I order are the lo-carb plate with gyro meat (gyro meat, lettuce, tomatoes tzatziki) and the gyro sandwich combo.

Very few places out here really know how to make authentic Greek/ Mediterranean food.

It's been months since that visit and I finally went here today to give it another shot. BIG MISTAKE! I ordered an order of hummus, falafel, and a chicken schwarma. First off, the chicken schwarma was horrible. It was like taking chicken from Taco Bell, add some shriveled tomatoes and some tahini on artificial pita bread, and you've got yourself the ideal American version of this traditional wrap. They don't even know how to make a schwarma!!! The falafel was so salty and grainy...and if you've had great falafel before, you would know that Stephano's version is just crap. The hummus had NO FLAVOR whatsoever. When hummus is made, the garbanzo beans and tahini bring out such a robust flavor all on its own when made the traditional and proper way. Everything I've tried thus far is just soooo overly processed. Eating at Stephano's is like eating at the McDonald's of the Greek and Mediterranean food genre. I will never go back again. As a matter a fact, go right around the corner to kabob express on eastern and trop. Now that place is a lot more decent, freshly-made food that won't put a hole in your wallet.

I saw they had Innus and Gunn which had me perk up instantly since you'll typically find this at a liquor store only. I ordered one along with my meal but ended up disappointed as they had it displayed on the wrong shelf, expecting it to be $3.50 when in reality cost close to $5.00. When I asked about the price he replied, \"Oops, someone must have put it on the wrong shelf. Do you still want it?\" I was hoping he would have made some sort of effort to adjust the price this one time but no such luck. I went with a Blue Moon instead.

When I called in and asked about the portion compared to a full Gyro, they said it's smaller compared to a typical Gyro but can still fill you. They were right about one thing, it definitely was filling. If this was \"small\" compared to their typical Gyro then you had better bring an appetite for a Gyro. This wrap was definitely a good size and the price was definitely generous for the amount. The meat was very tender and the hummus tasted very \"authentic\", unlike some cheap hummus you'd buy from a store. They also throw some pita bread and hummus as a side at no charge and free baklava, which was also very good, if you check in on Yelp.\n\nI only give 5 stars to places that absolutely blow my mind.

I am on a two-week journey in Edinburgh for reasons unrelated to food.  However, being a food blogger, I made a point to have at least one restaurant experience each day for the purposes of my reviews.  I figured that considering the amount of walking I'd been doing, I shouldn't have had any problem keeping my weight down.  By the end of the two weeks, I had gained ten pounds.  I blame restaurants like Nawroz for that.\nIs this a critical review?  Not in the slightest.  I'm only saying that with nearly every restaurant I've been in, I've never seen more generosity in service and portions than businesses specializing in Middle Eastern cuisine.  Okay, perhaps I would put them on a tie with the Greeks, but I would much prefer large portions of Middle Eastern cuisine than of Greek.\nYeah, I know, I'm going to get murdered for that one.  \n\nI'm not saying that Middle Eastern cuisine is better than Greek cuisine.  I'm saying that Middle Eastern cuisine is...clearly better, how can anyone argue with that?  I've said that certain cuisines become gateways to other cuisines; they stimulate your culinary curiosity while others are gastronomic thunderdomes.  Which would I put in the latter category?  Obviously American and westernized Chinese.  Even sushi is starting to fall into that category.  But gateway cuisines?  Indian definitely, French and maybe Dutch to lesser degrees, they all open our minds to new ideas, leading to other possibilities.  From Indian, you may try Nepalese, Persian, or Moroccan.  Of course, if one is talking technicalities, these countries are only lines on a map, and when addressing nutritional anthropology, what you get are hundreds of tribes migrating through history across Africa and Asia, sharing their ideas and techniques. \n \nComprehending that, suddenly calling a certain cuisine Indian makes no sense, as what classifies as Indian food is actually several different culinary methods which happen to occupy that region.  What classifies as Indian changes depending on where in India you are?  In fact, naming a cuisine not after a country but a people should be more appropriate.  Kurdish cuisine encompasses Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey.  With that, there are quite a few foods which the average curioso will recognize.  You'll find falafels, humus, flatbreads, baklava, and shawarma.  So what should you do when given such variety?  You order it all.\n\nWait, what?  \n\nNawroz offers various dishes but one is a mixed collection of various starters.  So the five of us ended up getting large mixed plates of starters with only two mains, allowing us to share in the traditional Middle Eastern fashion.  You don't order a main and lift from it selfishly.  You order a mountainous bowl of food and open the plates of the table to share.  This is what you do.  Nawroz should be experienced each time as a gathering of friends and family.  Invent a celebration if you have to.  Someone's birthday?  A wedding?  Christmas (which they celebrate at Nawroz ironically), or how about the traditional Iranian new year...which is actually called Nawroz.  So the restaurant is named after one of the most boisterous events in all the Middle East; why wouldn't you take that opportunity?  It's like a restaurant that celebrates Christmas all year round.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor is perfect with what it attempts to convey: culture and tradition with mild compromises to operate as a functional restaurant.  Red and black chairs over a tiled floor, raw brick on the walls with hanging rugs, tapestries, and paintings.  Various regional iconographies rest upon the bar.  I can feel the pride of the owners in their culture by the d\u00e9cor of the restaurant and the quality of their food.  Even the hummus is molded into a fan, topped with olives.  The flatbread is fried, a new first and favorite.  The mixed starters ranged from contemporary to intimidating and I devoured each and every one.  Even though we had ordered mixed starters for five with only two mains, we couldn't squeeze another plate of food onto our table.  Everything was good and we still had dessert waiting for us--three types of baklava with Turkish delight.  \nI'll reiterate my previous point.  The various cultures of the Middle East know how to make people welcome and this is reflected in their restaurants.  Their food is munificent, huge portions at reasonable prices.  With Shezan and Nawroz being so close to each other (walking distance) I know that any future domiciles in Edinburgh would have to be in close proximity to this region so when I entertain visitors, I always have a place to go.  I am happy that my small home town has a Persian restaurant--so at least my absence from this cuisine would be short.\n\nDECOR:  9\nPLATING: 8\nSERVICE:  8\nFOOD:  9\nVALUE:  10\n\nOVERALL:  8.8 out of 10", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}}], "state": "EDH", "stars": 4.5, "latitude": 55.9453189}], "85302": [{"full_address": "5826 W Olive Ave\nSte B101\nGlendale, AZ 85302", "hygiene": 0, "rest_id": "khUAi7h8c57uHdliKrv5FA", "categories": ["Greek", "Mediterranean", "Middle Eastern"], "city": "Glendale", "review_count": 71, "name": "Babylon Gyros & Shish Kabobs", "longitude": -112.1845146, "reviews": [{"text": "I love this place.

We arrived at 7 to a largely empty dining room but were warmly greeted by the new owner.  He retreated to the kitchen to make us some fresh hummus which was absolutely fantastic.  Rather than order off the menu he offered to create a \"mixed grill\" type of family style plate.  After a short wait, during which we polished off the hummus, we were presented with an amazing platter of grilled meats including chicken (prepared two different ways), steak (again, two different ways), veggies (tomatoes, pickles [totally unlike what you're probably imagining], sliced onion, and green olives [again, totally unlike what most Americans are used to...not at all like the pimento stuffed olives from a can]).  Fresh pita bread accompanied both the hummus and the entree.  Even my sister, who was admittedly a little skeptical when we first arrived, loved the food!  \n\nWhile we ate, some of the \"regulars\" began to drift in to share tea, coffee, play gin rummy, and socialize with one another.

The owner was on his computer, when we walked in, sitting in ordinary wood cafe-type chairs suitable for a fast food type of place.

The Chicken section has items like garlic chicken, chicken caesar, and chicken kabob. The Beef and Wrap has items like Beef Kabob, Beef Kefta, Mediterranean Burger, Falafel, and Vegetarian wrap. The Soup and Salad section has items like the Mediterranean Salad, and Tabbouleh (mix of chopped parsley, tomato, cracked wheat, extra virgin olive oil, and fresh lemon juice). The Sides section includes hummus, french fries, and grape leaves (mix of rice, beef, lemon wrapped in grape leaves! YUM!)

The Original Gyro had grilled charbroiled beef and lamb topped with fresh red onion (very fresh!), tomato, tzatziki or Manna sauce.

I first became aware of Manna at the San Gennaro Feast when after wandering around food purgatory, the scent of their food saved me. I loved their food  then and was looking forward to checking out their main location on Gibson Rd. just North of the I-215. \n\nWhen I walked in I was the only customer. There was a man and woman sitting at a table talking and the man got up when I came in and went behind the counter. I placed my order for Garlic Chicken (Shawarma), a side of fries and a fountain drink. Nothing too adventurous, stick with the relative safe stuff was the mindset. \n\nI have a problem with merchants that make you sign debit card receipts for purchases under $25. Manna is one of those places who hasn't figured out that you don't have to do this anymore. But moving past the pet peeve I'm handed a drink cup and turn to the fountain...which is disgusting. It's sitting on a stainless steel counter which makes it easy to clean. But this was not clean, far from it. I wish I had snapped a picture of it to illustrate the problem. I managed to carefully make my drink and look around for any utensils...those are up by the main counter and not logically placed at all. And there are no napkins to be found. None. So I grab what I can and look for a table to sit at. \n\nMy table choices are ick, ickier, and no, I don't think so. Does anyone know how to wield the almighty wash cloth or sponge here? Doesn't seem like it. I find a table that has minimal ick and have a seat. My food arrives pretty quick...as it's being prepared I see two guys in the back, one of them sharpening knives and then carving my chicken on the spot so this looked good. But what came to my table was boring food! Garlic chicken? I didn't taste ANY garlic in my food. None. And the chicken was also dry. Thank goodness for the fries, as they were just as good as the ones I had at the San Gennaro Feast. They kept me from going hungry and having a flavorless lunch. \n\nThis place represents my fear of trying new places in a nutshell. I get the courage up to go in and try something new...and then I get bleech, unmemorable food. While I was sitting there the guy working the counter stepped outside and looked at his Open sign It was on, but I knew why nobody was coming in. When the guy working the counter leaves dirty trays and half eaten food sitting on top of the trash can while he watches South Park, and the food they served seems to have missed out on any kind of spices much less garlic it becomes quite clear they've got problems. \n\nHow this place stays in business is a testament to divine intervention. It's a guardian angel keeping this place open, not the quality of their food. At least the guardian angel keeps you from needing the kaopectate afterwards. If you dare to try it I don't suggest leaving a tip, bring them a clean sponge or pack of dish cloths instead. \n\n1 star: The french fries earned it, nothing else did.", "review_stars": 1, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 3, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "It's about time I tried this Mediterranean joint I've passed many times before.

The rice was a little oily and having the flat bread gives another texture component.  The salad was served with a Greek vinaigrette.  Although the shish kabobs were served with the same sides.  The ground beef, although flavorful, was a little dry.  The zucchini was super crunchy and offered a lot of texture to the dish.  The marinara sauce was really runny, so when I dipped the zucchini chips, nothing really stayed on the chip.  \n\nAll in all, the place was a good choice for dinner.

The hummus is pretty flavorful; I wouldn't say it is an award winner, but it is still very tasty. The salad that comes with the plate is just a small side-salad, but the dressing is good and it fills that veggie role of the meal. The french fries here are awesome; I know that really isn't a selling point for anybody, but they are different than most restaurant's french fries. Crispier and full of flavor.\n\nI can't say the interior is something to write home about, just a small \"mom&pop\" shop that caters mostly to carry-out orders probably.

We covered our tah deeg with an herb stew called Khoresh Gormeh Sabzee (Khoresh is a stew kind of alike in concept to an Indian curry, except with totally different spices, while Sabzee means herbs/greens, so it's essentially an herb/green stew with kidney beans and tender beef).  Gormeh Sabzee is probably the most popular khoresh in Iran.  What a delicious starter.\n\nWe couldn't decide between the ground beef kabob (an Iranian staple analogous to a cheeseburger in the U.S.), the chicken (called joojeh) kabob, or the lamb shank, so we got all three.  Waaaaaaayyyyy too much food but it was good.  Kabobs vary greatly in Persian cuisine, with everyone having a different take.  This was a plump, lean, and juicy kabob with a mild flavor...I'd give it a 7 or 8 out of 10 which is good.  The joojeh (chicken) kabob needed to be marinated longer in lemon and onion but was cooked very well.  The lamb shank was very good and almost great.

I have to commend the chef on this dish.  It was well seasoned and they accomplished the trick of grilling the chicken and it was still tender and juicy!  Well done!!\n\nMy husband had the Salmon with Sabzi Polo.  The salmon was tastefully marinated in their own special sauce and was served with their Sabzi Polo rice.  The rice is basmati mixed with with fresh garlic, dill weed, parsley & cilantro.  Wonderful, wonderful rice!!  We both loved it.\n\nThey have an attractive patio so you can enjoy outdoor seating.

It was very difficult to enjoy with the sour/tart aftertaste. Since this was our first time, we decided to order the chefs special platter. It contained chicken breast kebob, ground beef Kebob, and lamb Kebob. On top of that we also ordered the shish Kebob platter. This platter contained \"filet mignon\" Kebob (biggest lie, filet mignon isn't a thin strip of meat which is tough, unless they don't know how to cook it), another chicken breast Kebob and lamb Kebob. We ordered these platters for some variety, but the funny thing is, there was no variety. All of the meats were marinated in the same spices/sauce that in result, didn't allow us to differentiate between all of the different meats. I am a foody and I cook traditional shish Kebob at home, being that I am from the Middle East. This restaurant does not deserve to sell and advertise their horribly tasting Kebobs. Having said that, their basmati rice was my favorite dish. That is why I'm generous enough to give them two stars.

It was quite a drive for me, but I enjoyed the food so much that I came for dinner twice within the same week. The vibe seemed subdued from the lack of patrons, but the quiet atmosphere made it a cozy place to bring dates and small gatherings. Along with the front patio, there was a full bar situated next to the entrance. Past the partition was the dining area with scores of smaller tables surrounding the long vertical one for large gatherings. The blue, purple, and beige d\u00e9cor nicely complemented the warm lighting and a number of paintings on the walls.\n\nTheir complementary pita bread was thick, fluffy, and pillow-like with a hint of smoke. It was a great starter with Halim Bademjan ($7.50) assembled with fried eggplant, tomatoes, garlic, onions, and other seasoning. The consistency was not as thick or flavorful as the one at Flame International. However, the pronounced garlic flavor was a hit when added to the soft smoky pita. My only wish was for the eggplant flavor to stand out more. It was good, but not mind blowing.\n\nThe Lamb Shish-Kebab ($21) was put together with chunks of marinated lamb, tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, and at my request, cherry rice ($4.50).  The lamb was tender and moist with full-on flavor. The cuts were chewy, but I could taste the saffron as the mix of cherry was delicious in the basmati. For the price, I wished there could be more cherries in the basmati, but the lamb made quite an impression. \n\nThe Chicken Shish-Kebab ($17) arrived with charbroiled marinated chicken breast, bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, and choice of dill and lima beans rice ($4.5). The chicken came with tremendous wow factor: super moist, juicy, and flavorful. The dill and lima beans basmati was not overpowering, and instead the taste was complementary to the chicken.\n\nThe Cornish Hen Kebob ($17) was equally outstanding. This dish came with an entire Cornish Hen served bone-in, and each piece was evenly cooked to perfection to render a meaty juicy sensation. The cherry rice was again a hit. I will go the distance whenever I can find cherry rice. \n\nLastly, the Salmon Kebob ($18.50) came with marinated salmon and basmati rice mixed with fresh garlic, dill weed, parsley & cilantro. The salmon was tender but slightly overdone. The rice had a smooth refined flaovr as a secondary to provide depth. I wasn't particularly blown away by this dish, especially since the previous dishes were really outstanding. Among them, I'm still partial to the Lamb and Chicken Kebob. \n\nService was inconsistent, as my dining companion drank from a dirty glass without knowing it until the end of his meal.

We sit and wait... and wait... and wait... I search the room for him and there he is... standing over some girl's clevage as she giggles and twirls her hair. and FINALLY (one time 40 minutes later) we get our food. a-hole supreme usually plops our plates down and gives us more coles and is GONE.

A huge plate of rice with great seasoning. The saffron and olive oil gave the fluffy rice great texture. The Shawarma was fresh and delicious. The chicken was cooked and seasoned nicely.\n\nFor dessert, we tried the Persian vanilla ice cream with rose water and saffron as well as the Baghlava. The ice cream was some of the best we've had. Great flavor. The Baghlava was a great complement to the ice cream. A nice sweetness from the honey and the flaky dough was great.\n\nSo in summary, great atmosphere, great owners, out-of-this-world food, and very affordable. Everything we had came to about $32.

The first time, less than two years ago, I ordered the chicken shawarma entree (complete with pickled veggies, hummus, garlic sauce, and pita).  Many of the chicken pieces were still uncooked that I could hardly chew it, and some were still blood-red!  When I started to complain about about this to my server, he acted as if no one has ever complained about the food here before.  He left, and he came back with whom I thought was the cook, who had acted even more offended about my accusation of the meat being uncooked.  He mentioned something about how everything is timed perfectly in the oven, but he offered to bring a new dish out.  Twelve minutes later (yes, I time these things), a slightly more cooked dish of chicken was laid out in front of me.  I decided I'd salvage what I could and just chalk it up to a bad day.  My favorite things in that entree were the pickled veggies and the garlic sauce.  Oh my... the garlic sauce!!  \n\nA few days after that, I brought my Mom with me for dinner.  We ordered the lamb kabob entree to share.  She wasn't impressed with the kabobs, since she had Byblos' lamb shanks on the brain (Byblos' lamb is pretty good, we think).  It was official- the hummus here leaves much to be desired.  However, I still thought the garlic sauce was fantastic!  Tastes great with the tabouli/tabouleh (both are correct).\n\nFast-forward many, many months to two days ago, I decided to order take-out for Mom and me- chicken shawarma sandwich, no pickle (tomatoes, lettuce, and garlic sauce in pita); gyro, no pickle, no cucumber sauce (lamb meat and lettuce in pita); and gyro with everything for Mom.  Why did it take me all this time to finally order these sandwiches to-go?  Both types are must-tries: the shawarma is a popular choice of many here, and all it takes is one bite for you to know why.  The sauce and garlic schmear combo is to-die-for!  And one would think that a pita with only lamb meat and lettuce sounds too simple to be so tasty, but it is!  The meat is so moist and tender, you really don't need any condiment.  Trust me.  Heck, don't trust me and order one plain and one with the works and judge them yourself; Most of the sandwiches costs less than $4 each!  \n\nBTW, you may elect to have whole wheat pita instead of the plain normally used.  You may also take Haji-Baba pitas home (made at the Haji-Baba bakery on Apache east of the restaurant); you may find them on the register counter.  \n\nYou may pay for your take-out in advance and then wait for it to be prepared, or you may want to check out the grocery aisles as you're waiting and pay for everything at the end.  I suggest the chocoholics check out the Swiss chocolate bars here!  I've tried a few brands, and I just love the Milka brand: milk chocolate with whole hazelnut, milk and creamy white layered, plain milk chocolate.  (I love dark chocolate, but couldn't find one allergen-free.)  The flavors are so creamy and you can definitely taste the great quality ingredients used.  There are cheaper brands sold here, but a not-so-quick glance (you may or may not find English among the five or so languages listed on the back) will reveal that other vegetable fat, not cocoa butter, is used.  Go for the \"good chocolate\" brands; At two dollars or less a bar, you can leave with a goodie cache without having to spend much cash.  \n\nYou'll most likely find something in the grocery you'll want to buy, so don't forget to remember to pick up your take-out order.

From a grocery store/sit down store? A place called Haji-Baba? On Apache and McClintock? What? Surely you can't blame me for doubting his convictions. \n\nOne day we finally went in. I looked at the menu full of foreign foods and was overtaken by fear. \"What is all of this shit?\", I thought to myself. Of course, this was just a sign of how uncultured I was (and still am). Luckily, my friend took the work out of deciphering the menu and ordered a gyro for me. We got it to go. \n\nI opened up my gyro and saw huge chunks of meat. You know those places that have gyros with thin, insulting, child sized strips of meat? Yeah, this isn't one of those places. This is a gyro for a grown man. So, good start, right? I took a bite. It was... amazing. Their feta cheese, onions, and meat combined for one of the best foods I have ever tasted to this day. It was messy, juicy, the meat was packed so thick that it was difficult to eat (all positive notes), and wow, it was just brilliant. You know that feeling you get when you walk into BevMo for the first time and realize you're in alcohol heaven? When you realize you've stumbled upon something special and that you'll be back again and again? Yeah, that's the feeling.\n\nI ate at Haji Baba's again the next day. And about twice every week for a month afterwards. Later I learned that their \"Deluxe\" gyro is even better. I also discovered that they have some kickass foods in there. Special mention goes out to the chocolates..\n\nUnfortunately, I still haven't tried anything else on the menu. This is probably a result of a combination of me being terrified of the menu due to having no idea what those other foods are, and me internally weighing out the risk of eating an average or only above-average food as compared to eating one of my favorite food items in existence. Easy choice.\n\nI've never sat down to eat at Haji-Baba, but when getting the food to go there has never been a problem.

Usually dolmas are served chilled and are brimming with strong sour and oily flavors, not these. Haji Baba's recipe is truly unique; it's mild, not sour and rich with flavor.

This was, at least for me, the best place to get your Mediterranean fix including some of the tastiest stuffed grape leaves around. I can go on and on about how much I loved Alladin's but alas, I have to pick myself up and rise above this terrible loss. \n\nWhen a door closes a window opens and that window lead me right into the kitchen of Haji Baba. Situated along Apache Blvd in Tempe this spot is half restaurant and half Middle Eastern market and bakery, talk about a one stop shop. Upon entering, please feel free to seat yourself. On my visit there were menus already at each empty table. \n\nScanning the menu the first thing I noticed was the Abali Yogurt Soda ($1.69). Having never tried this I was quick to get a glass full though the waiter seemed hesitant to bring it. Let's just say after the first sip yogurt soda is an acquired taste. While I liked the yogurt sourness the saltiness of the soda was way too much. Fortunately the waiter was observant and brought over a glass of iced water by his own accord. I have to tell you that the service here is attentive and friendly. \n\nThe occasional juvenile in me snickered when I read the first item on the menu, Homos Tahini ($2.29), how appropriate. Joking aside, this was a beautiful puree of chickpeas, tahini or sesame seed paste, lemon juice and garlic. Usually this is served super garlicky elsewhere I was delighted to find this version to be well balanced and flavorful. Getting the same treatment as the homos, the Babaghanooj ($2.99) contains roasted eggplant instead of chickpeas. Both were dressed with olive oil and adorned with pickles and olives, were wishing for a glass of wine to compliment the appetizers, but they serve no liquor here.\n\nMade from a mixture of fava beans and chickpeas, then pressed into patties and deep fried, the filling of the Falafil Sandwich ($2.69) was crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside. The warm pita bread and the fresh lettuce and tomato made for really good eats, a must.\n\nKabob Koubideh ($7.49) sounds like quite a mouthful and let me tell you this, it was. Pounded ground meat marinated in onion juice, and then grilled to a juicy smoky excellence. The meat reminded me of a Middle Eastern take on chopped steak, sublimely tender. Along side was a huge pile of super light basmati rice, fresh hot pita and creamy yogurt salad. A sprinkling of sumac over the entire plate adds a slight sourness, which melds incredibly well with this type of food. \n\nDesserts are pretty much limited to Baklava ($1.29), but after such an amazing meal it was a real surprise that the sweet ending was a real disappointment. The nuts in each all tasted old with a slightly bitter rancidity to them. Selections ranged from pistachio, cashew and walnut with the later being the best, using the word \"best\" loosely. \n\nWith meager prices, generous portions and outstanding service, Haji Baba will definitely begin to fill the void in my heart and my tummy.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 4, "useful": 5, "cool": 4}}, {"text": "Like Princess & Baiz Markets, this is a grocery store with a small cafe inside.

I took the opportunity to have lunch here last Friday since the wife had an appointment at a tattoo place just around the corner, forcing us to drive all the way from Surprise. I was like \"Holy sh1t, Haji Babas is supposed to be around here somewhere\" while Google Mapping the tat shop location.\n\nNow, I'm no stranger to dinge. I grew up in an \"old\" city, and Sydney and outlying suburbs has its fair share of dingy places, perhaps topped by Gould's Book Arcade in Newtown. First impression of Haji Babas is that it's a dingy, hole in the wall establishment. So far, so good right? Basically it's divided up into a mini ethnic supermarket featuring stuff like Cock Cola (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2GmGT-7QjowR1ihup3FbVA?select=1dl1l6baJJdY7q53V-V7uw) and Patak's, one of my favourite Indian marinade and grill sauce brands. Ibbida ibbida WHAT? Indian in an Arabic grocery? Yep, but that's not where the Indian surprises end - stay tuned! The other section has a selection of cheap tables and chairs, the likes of which made even the decor at Chino Bandido's look opulent by comparison. Still, I was quite comfortable with it all. We sat down and had a look at the menu. Lots of familiar stuff, so in order to make a good comparison with other similar places I've eaten at, I ordered the hummus dip and vegetarian platter.\n\nFirst thing that struck me was that the initial babaghannoush plate was VERY good. Nothing beats the hummus/bbg from my home town's \"Istanbul on King\", but I'm going to say that this was probably the second best I've had - high praise from me - with lots of oil on top. The vegetarian platter was also quite good. It came with a side of raita, which was a little odd. No, it wasn't tzatziki. Although perhaps it was raitziki, or tzaita. The wife took one dip of it and proceeded to exclaim that it was the best raita she had ever had. I'd probably say that's true - it was just the right consistency, and had unusually large pieces of dill pickle in it. No, not cucumber. I did my cooldown test with the pita, it didn't get leathery (unlike Chicago Gyros') so another thumbs up there. I have two minor complaints, though. The dolmas were hot. I HATE hot dolmas, I don't know who invented the idea but all I've ever eaten for three decades in Oz has been the cold stuff. Never even KNEW they came in a heated variety until I arrived stateside. Perhaps the cold ones are an option, who knows. I'll find out next time I'm here. Because I'm definitely coming back. Last complaint, the falafels. They weren't as good as the Greek Wraps ones, and actually fairly salty. Strangely enough, my plate came with a small side of hummus, but it was different to what I'm used to - it had a yellowish tinge to it whereas typically it's a kind of off-white (added pinch of turmeric or saffron?) and the combo of falafels with it was a little too salty for my taste. Not enough to knock off a star though.\n\nThe wife had a chicken shishkabob with a giant amount of rice and salad - so much that she was stuffed and her plate didn't even look a quarter empty. Excellent value for money. I had a mouthful of her rice and would give it my vote for the most properly-cooked, fluffy basmati I've had in a LONG time. We did a once-through in the grocery area before we left and picked up some Patak marinades. And I couldn't leave without a piece of cashew baklava. Good, not the best I've had but pretty good. They have a couple of kid's chocolates up the front, the kid enjoyed that in the car despite getting half of it on his pants and the seat.\n\nThe prices are incredibly reasonable. I was seeing some things for three, four dollars. If it weren't for the fact that this place is almost 50 miles from where I live I'd eat here every few days. Why can't they open something like this in Surprise? We don't even have an INDIAN restaurant closer than eighteen or so miles away. You CenPho and Tempe locals should consider yourselves d4mn lucky.\n\nBig thumbs up for Haji Babas. If the owners are reading this, set up another location in the west valley for pete's sake! I need to go back here and get a handle on the dips and tastes and stuff because evidently these guys are giving their own little spin to middle eastern cuisine, at least as far as my experience goes. If I'm still learning, that's a good thing. Next time I'm going to see what the difference is between their \"pita\" and their \"hand-made pita\".

Fortunately, she booked in for another tattoo a couple of days ago which gave us another excuse to travel the 45 miles and have another bite at the Casa la Dinge. Unfortunately, the way the day played out meant that I headed in to Tempe with her, then had to kill about three hours waiting for her tattoo to be completed. During this time I met some friends and because I was starving I wound up having a quasi-lunch with them at Slices Pizza at the cnr of 6th and Mill. Doh! The wife wouldn't have tolerated me doing Haji Baba's with them because SHE wanted to join me at HB for a late lunch. I thus had two lunches on the day, but because I wasn't too hungry after she and I arrived at HB, I had to make do with a couple of appetizers. I ordered the Foul Mudammas, the falafel and the yoghurt soda. The soda made me shudder at the unexpected taste, but I did manage to strangle down about half of it, with a face that probably appeared to onlookers as though I was being cornholed with a pineapple. Reminded me a lot of salt lassi, except this was saltier. Basically like drinking salty melted butter out of a bag of Orville Redenbacher. The wife grimaced at her first swallow, then came back a few minutes later for another go-round (that's my girl!) I can see why the damn stuff is popular - in a Warheads-candy sort of way. The Mudammas was pretty good, but my gut was quite full by this time and I didn't even finish the falafels. Oh well. Wife had the chicken kabob, same as last time I think - the plate was overloaded and the food was delicious, once again.\n\nAfter we finished I started with the usual wandering up and down the aisles looking at the weird foods and their names. Wife said she needed to hit the restroom. About a minute later she was back, with sort of a guilty wan smile on her face. I was wondering whether the crapper was out of order or something else funny had happened. I was wrong. Apparently the previous occupant had dropped a couple of foul mudammas of his own in the bog, and the stench was so rancid that my wife threw up almost all of her meal. I kid you not. She said she struggled to hold her breath but in the end, blammo. By this time I was doing the potty dance as well and with more than a little trepidation went to the restroom. I sniffed (WHY?!) but the smell had cleared out by now and it was tolerable. However, the toilet fixtures themselves were disgraceful. I took a couple of photos of the faucet (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2GmGT-7QjowR1ihup3FbVA?select=R-J7WlBAZ7cGGRMTetoRxA), and the string holding their mirror above the sink (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2GmGT-7QjowR1ihup3FbVA?select=DkWNs54J3xmfmZ1KHX2CbA). If they're going for realistic Arabic slum atmosphere and decor at this place, congrats - they hit the mark one hundred percent. Please, DON'T go into the restroom if you visit this place.. you'll spend the rest of the day, like I did, wondering if the kitchen fixtures look the same. Spoiled the experience for me, and there's NO reason they can't renovate such a tiny room and make it at least a little more passable. Made the shitter in \"Trainspotting\" look like the jewelry counter at Harrods.\n\nThree stars (two knocked off for the state of the restroom, and I'm not counting the stench/vomiting incident in this demerit), and my brief addiction has been broken.

Cheap food, good tasting, generous portions, I didn't get food poisoning, and the cashew baklava was awesome, but next time we're in town I'll probably go back to Slices Pizza or look for an alternate Middle Eastern fix.

My partner and I shared a variety of things: gyros, kebab, chicken shwarema, rice, hummus (which on the menu is spelled \"homos,\" much to the amusement of the kids), and tabouli, with homemade pita bread. My cousins both got the veggie platters and I honestly don't remember what my uncle got. :) The gyros and kebab were phenomenal, extremely flavourful, and the gyros was the best I'd had in a long time. I think the chicken shwarama was my favourite though. It almost melts in your mouth and the flavours are fantastic. The hummus was very good, especially with the homemade pita. (Definitely pay the extra for the \"real\" stuff. Store bought just doesn't cut it here.) I'm not really a huge fan of tabouli, but my partner seemed to like it well enough. One great little surprise for me were the dolmas (stuffed grape leaves). A traditional Greek dish, I'm never really a fan. My dad makes these by the bucketful and freezes them. Usually, for me, they tend to be bitter and too bland, but I got to try one off of one of the veggie plates and it was actually REALLY good. I honestly think it may have been the best dolmades I've ever had. So I'd recommend it. \n\nTo drink I took a risk and got the yogurt soda. Anyone familiar with Indian food will most likely have tried lassi at one point of another.... this is NOT lassi. This is definitely an acquired taste, but if you want to try something different, give it a shot. It is literally plain, unsweetened yogurt with soda water. No one else at my table liked it, but I thought it was different and in its own way, rather refreshing. \n\nWe shared the pistachio and pecan baklava at the end of the meal. Fresh, homemade and soooooo good! \n\nI have lots of reasons to go back, one of which would be the bill at the end of the night. Keep in mind, there were 4 of us on our tab, 2 kebab sandwiches, 3 drinks, my yogurt soda, the chicken shwarama plate, a kebab, a gyros and 2 baklava and it all came up to about $35.

Apparently, lemon and garlic are spices-non-grata in this kitchen, and even salt and pepper are used sparingly.  For $2.60 you get enough hummous for two, as an appetiser, but you won't want to finish it.  It reminds me a lot of paste.  And the pita (bread) was going stale. Exceptions: their take on a meat-stuffed eggroll, and, believe it or not, the gyros.  Also well-spiced: a variety of sauces which helps offset the blandness of the food.  I must also comment on the tabouleh (which here means ground parsley) served as a huge mound on most plates; it would feed a baseball team, but it, too, is tasteless.  Other, much smaller, issues: it can get crowded, the ambiance does not exist, and they have an odd system for paying your check which puts you in a line with the people buying groceries and can be slow.\n\nHints:\n1.  Order the Combination plate.  For $12 it is definitely enough for two average appetites and you don't get bored so easily.  \n2.  They have a large grocery using the same name 3/4 mile east.

I wanted to check this place out with fresh eyes. Some of my points here have been shared many times over in previous reviews but again, I purposely didn't read them so this review is from my eyes as a \"virgin\" visitor.\n\nMy son and I came here last night before heading to Gammage for a play. My first thought upon entering was \"Am I in the wrong the place?\" Haji-Baba is a small ethnic market as well as having a small eatery inside. It is an older store and the restaurant is off to the far right side of the store. In fact, the restaurant seems like an afterthought. There are very old tables and chairs, with the cheapest silverware, napkins, plates and glasses that the restaurant supply stores carry. There is no personality to this part of the store at all. And while that isn't entirely a bad thing because I'm not afraid to visit a dive restaurant, in the case of Haji-Baba, this was just a sign of things to come. \n\nDespite being severely overdressed, we were seated at a nearby table by a polite man who came across like one of the owners. Unfortunately, he was not our server. Our server was a man who was barely audible when he did speak to us, which was nominal at best; which is to say that he said just enough to get our order and then never came back again. Our dinners came out in less than 5 minutes..which seemed very surprising to me. Although our dishes are not complex, nor is the menu as there are limited selections at Haji-Baba, I thought that there might be a little more effort, especially now that I've read so many other reviews on this place. The food was clearly pre-made and just scooped on the plate. I guess that's ok and maybe I'm spoiled and used to cooked-to-order food lately. Hard to say.\n\nThe food itself was pretty good. My schwarma plate came with tabouli, hummus, rice, schwarma and 1/2 of a pita. My son's beef schwarma had rice, greek salad and schwarma. No hummus for him and he had the other 1/2 of my pita. Both of the schwarmas were fine. It was nothing special. I've had better and I've had worse. The hummus was creamy though kind of bland and the pitas were warm and flavorful...when we got more! Our first one was kind of blah. The rice was just plain white rice. The Greek salad was way overdressed to the point of soggy. The tabouli was nice though with just the right amount of crunch. \n\nOverall, this would have been a 3 star review if not for the lackluster service we received. Our server had zero personality. He never came back to check on us though he stopped at several tables near us to give them a \"thumbs up\" to check on them so maybe it was just us and the fact that we were dressed up that put him off. I thought initially that he might not have been comfortable speaking English as clearly most of the staff here were European but he spoke beautifully to the tables around us. Our drink vessels were bone dry. I had to flag down the guy who seated us to get extra pitas and refills on our drinks. Next time I'm in Tempe, I'll go the 1/2 mile up the street to Pita Jungle for Mediterranean food. The service was better and the food had some heart put into the process of preparation.

In other words, you come here if you like the food. I was glad to see that they serve kibbeh, which is a Middle Eastern dish I had trouble finding when I last lived in Phoenix, and so I ordered the kibbeh plate. My reaction was a little mixed. First, the plate came with sides of tabouli and hummus, and both were excellent. The hummus was smooth and creamy and nicely spiced and the tabouli was very enjoyable. My mixed feelings concern the kibbeh, which I found to be mediocre. First, I was surprised by its shape and texture. Anywhere else where I have ordered kibbeh, the kibbeh comes in the shape of a dumpling, whereas this was served like two pieces of cake from a square pan. Also, normally the bulgur wheat shell is crunchy, whereas the bulgur wheat here was soft and only lined the top of each piece. I also found the kibbeh to be slightly on the bland side.

Searching   Yelp for the small, independent kitchens, we happened on Haji-Baba.  Reading the reviews, I see that one of my favorite reviewers gives it a high-five.  This is enough for me.  We head on down and find this place on east Apache Blvd in a small, mostly empty strip mall. Haji-Baba is a small, unassuming dining room attached to a ME grocery.  It was interesting wandering around the grocery and checking out all the different items for sale.  We quickly found a table and met the waiter.\n\nreading the menu, I found several things that interested me - the Chicken or Beef Sharwerma definitely - the menu descriptions made them both sound delicious.  The wife decided on the chicken.  Wanting to break out of that, and finding the name somewhat funny, I ordered the Kabob Koubideh and the MIL had the vegetarian combination.  I had iced tea to wash it down.\n\nThe Koubideh is essentially ground beef marinated in onion juice and grilled on a skewer, coming out looking like a hamburger in the shape of a hot dog.  This plate came with two tasty kabobs, a big pile of steamed Basmati rice and bread.  There was also a Tzaziki-style sauce that helped add some moisture to the meal and was delicious when mixed with the rice.  The chicken Sharwerma was a big pile of marinated chicken with a dollop of garlic mayonnaise on top, with the same rice and bread as well as a side of hummus.  I tasted that and it too, was very tasty, especially when combined with the mayonnaise.  The MIL was not real happy with the veggie plate, and for me it just looked like a bunch of steamed vegetable stuff.\n\nMy iced tea was delicious, with a cinnamon-y taste.  I wish I could have had a refill on that.  I was impressed with the diversity of the dining crowd, it was most definitely multi-cultural and everybody seemed to be enjoying the meal.  Paying the check is a bit of an ordeal and could be handled better - essentially, the waiter leaves the ticket stub on your table, which you take to the cashier in the grocery, who then locates your ticket and rings it up.  Yes, you have to wait in line with the grocers and the take-away orderers.  This was a bit confusing at first, as we waited about 20 minutes before getting the waiters attention so he could explain the process.  Heck, I didn't even see him drop the stub off.

While the food is delightful, the atmosphere is strange and, to be frank, slightly dirty.  From the market on the side, to the plastic glassware, to the aged chairs, this place is not much to look at.  So if you're looking for a tasty, affordable meal, Haji-Baba is a must.

Their gyro meat is very well done, and if I have any criticism, it would be they slice their gyro meat off the spit in much too large of slices.  It's not overseasoned or particular greasy, very tender.  When ordering with the plate, it comes with a side salad on house dressing and a helping of rice.  There's nothing particularly to the rice and they offer way, way too much - enough for several days worth of leftovers.  I'm also not too impressed with the side salad - the dressing is a bit salty and my salad was overdressed.\n\nThe falafel are fantastic.  Crispy, slightly crumbling, slightly moist, great for some delicious hummus dipping.\n\nHaji-Baba is part sit-down restaurant, part counter-service restaurant, part Middle Eastern market, and it all somehow makes total sense when you step inside.

To be honest, I've had better Middle Eastern food; but what they offer, how much of it they give you, and the stellar service provided, easily makes this restaurant THE place to beat.  The most-memorable item on their menu is their dolmas, which, I admit, I didn't like when I first tried them, but have since fallen in love with:  fat, with a unique filling I can't really describe and served hot. ( If, like me, you are used to the small, cold, rice-filled dolmas, you really need to try these and keep an open mind.)   Typically, I get the vegetarian platter, which, like most of what they serve, comes with copious amounts of tabooli, hummus, felafel, yoghurt (sort of like tzatziki, but not quite), dolmas, etc.  If you have a big appetite -- and readers of my reviews know I'm gluttonous -- you will NOT be hungry when you leave this place!  My partner is a fan of their gyro sandwich, which, not surprisingly, is big and tasty.\n\nHaji Baba also has a store taking up half the establishment offering a variety of foods and other items from the Middle East and Bosnia.  They also sell fresh Feta (get the Greek, not the Bulgarian), Burek (a cheese-filled pastry), decent baklava and many other things unavailable in the Valley at very reasonable prices.  Disadvantage (for me)?  They're all the way in Tempe; so if you live west of I-17, bring a book and lots of water for your haj across the Valley to get here!\n\nOne more important note:  I read, with much amusement, the review from someone complaining that she showed up here in an evening gown only to find out the place is \"one step above a fast-food place.\"  Honestly, that's no exaggeration:  show up here overdressed and don't be surprised if you see people doubling-up in hysterical laughter and running to the bathroom to avoid peeing their pants.  Most of the customers frequenting Haji Baba are students from nearby ASU, local workers on lunch break and your average, every day 'proletariat', as I'm sure the complaining reviewer would refer to them as being.

Upon walking into the restaurant, I was a little confused because it was half shopping market and half restaurant. But I felt reassured when I noticed that it was full of people conversing, eating, and looking so glorious with their plates of food! Not only that, but it was a diverse set of people which shows that their food is so great that it breaks cultural/ethnic boundaries. \n\nWe were seated in such a down-to-earth fashion that it immediately made us feel so comfortable talking to our host and waiter. Service here is wonderful because not only does the waiter joke with you and is easy to talk to, but they are also efficient when it comes to bringing out your food and checking up on you--they do it so naturally, too. \n\nI decided on ordering the CHICKEN SCHWARMA PLATE (grilled marinated chicken with garlic sauce, rice, flatbread, hummus, and a cilantro salad?) that everyone else recommended. Glad my first Middle Eastern plate was this one because I finished like 95% of it (hey, it was a humongous pile of scrumptious food). The grilled marinated chicken tasted absolutely amazing when you mix it up with the garlic sauce and the rice and add a bit of hummus with each bite. Perfect mixture for the win!!! I made sure to eat the mixture with the flat bread first and when that was over, I killed the rest of it. To make sure my palette wasn't too overwhelmed with the meaty, creamy flavors, they had a cilantro salad that was refreshingly acidic to refresh your taste buds. What I also loved about this plate was the hummus; the hummus was well seasoned where you can eat a lot of it (since it wasn't too salty like store brand hummus usually are)--it had a slight taste to it which complemented pretty much everything on that plate.\n\nWould love to come back here whenever I'm back in Phoenix. Would highly recommend it to those living in the area (you guys are so lucky!).

I don't eat red meat, so I cannot comment on their beef dishes, but my son LOVES them. I always order their Arabic coffee.  It's not Turkish, as some people have written.  Turkish coffee is made with a different spice, but the technique is the same. Either way, I love the Arabic coffee here.\n\nI would give them five stars, but their hummus can be too salty at times. Maybe they are using canned hummus, don't know and I hope they don't.  Also their tabouleh usually is dripping with lemon and that's too much for me. The bulgur should soak up just enough to flavor and still be dry. \n\nHere you will also find a great, but quaint, grocery store. Their pricing is awesome and I love the selections of spices, herbs and teas. Their feta is fresh and priced so well that I refuse to buy it anywhere else. They also offer various kitchen items that are priced very reasonably as well.  I've bought my tea and coffee sets from there and my cutting boards.

Coming from NYC and Brooklyn i had ate at my fair share of this kinda places and this one surely keeps up the mark. \n\nThink of a college town joint and prices with Scottsdale taste. Service was great too - Never annoying but we could see the guy glancing at our table often to note if something was needed. They even let us keep the car in their lot as we went on exploring neighborhood. \n\nNot a damn thing bad about this place. \nWhy not 5 stars? I think it could be a bit more authentic and a bit less cheesy. But in reality it does not matter when food shows up. \n\n\"I like\"", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Something wrong with watching the war on the news, hearing about  Israel bombing the shit out of Gaza, and a Palestinian girl serving you dinner at the same time. That is precisely what I did tonight at Phoenicia, though not exactly on purpose. \n\nThe first thing we noticed walking in is how surprisingly nice and clean the place is for a middle eastern restaurant. Seriously, it's really tidy. The second thing I noticed is how odd the waitress was acting. She had to be on something crazy. She was practically running to do things and there were only 3 tables in the place, all busy eating... just bazaar. She was not very friendly but a competent waitress nonetheless. She said things like \"you ready yet?\" and \"give me your cup so I can get you more soda.\" Whatever, at least she was doing her job well. \n\nI had the shish kafta which is basically a shisk kebob in a sandwich form. It was very good with a nice mix of veggies and good hummus. The only complaint from me is the lettuce they used was of mediocre quality, and I like the way they built it, with the veggies on the inside. Nothing is worse than when your veggies all fall off because they don't have anything to hold them in. What a novel idea, put the meat on top and use that to hold everything in there. I can't believe I've never thought of that myself when I make pita sandwiches. Leave it to the Mexicans, those buggers can figure out how to make a rocket ship out of duct tape and cat hair I swear.\n\nSide story, I had to replace a window screen on my 3rd floor and I called like 10 screen companies and none of them would do it. Finally I got the nerve to buy a screen at Home Depot and pay a Mexican to put it on. He and a friend climbed the damned tree out front and put it on a stick. While holding it in place with one stick, they used another one to turn the fasteners and lock it into its fittings. Fucking a.... 10 professionals couldn't do it, but the first Mexican day laborer I get figures it out in 5 minutes. \n\nThis was a good experience and I'd definitely go back. It's inexpensive, easy to get to via train, and clean.

The tahini sauce was good, for I have found it can be somewhat flavorless at some places. And the vegetables look clean and they tasted delicious. The ONLY downside to this experience, was the pita. It was a little dry and not warm. If the pita had been warm and not as kind of brittle as it was, I would have been 100% pleased with my food. \n\nOne of my friends got the vegetarian platter for which he'd never had before and scarfed it down.

They use natural coals (not the instalights) which allows for a \"smoother\" smoke as it were. They also carry much more in stock in terms of their brand.\n\nStaff: Generally speaking, very polite and very helpful, they will turn your coals as often as possible and accommodate a lot of requests. One simply need to follow the rules of common sense and be equally respectful.\n\nAmbience: Now this part is  particularly personal, but I have likened the ambience to being similar to that of Jabba's Palace or the Cantina from Star Wars, which to say the least, is amusing by far. Generally comfortable seats and couches, but I prefer the more quiet ambience of the outside balcony; in either case, you're bound for some great people watching, especially on wilder nights as they cater to a lot of the local arab community.

Huge stack of pita, 2 falafel and 2 beef kibbee.  Everything was excellent.  The kabobs were excellently grilled, the falafel was crispy on the outside, fresh and moist on the inside.  The sauces that came with (garlic, tdaziki and tahini) were all great for everything on the plates.\n\nThe decor needs a lady's touch and I really hope they spend a little cash in there to fix it up.

It looked like a cool place and I made a mental note to check it out soon.\n\nA few days later I found myself sitting across from my girlfriend in the spacious interior of Mijana.  This place is huge and a great deal of effort has been put into making it classy.  There is a large stage with a sound system that is superior to most of the rock clubs in this city.  When we were there a middle eastern band was tinkering around with their keyboards, stringed instruments and hand drums.  When they started paying later into our dinner I was pleasantly surprised.  They played middle eastern styled instrumental music that was not overbearing.  \n\nThe food is awesome.  Pita bread is made on site and is light, warm and fluffy which is unlike the compressed dense pita that one gets at most mediterranean restaurants.  We were brought out an olive oil dip infused with herbs that went well with the pita.  For our dinner we ordered the fattouch salad, vegetarian plate and lamb kabob.\n\nThe fattouch salad was amazing with its' lemony tart dressing and crispy pita pieces.  My dining companion commented that it may have been a bit salty, but it did not detract from the salad at all.\n\nThe vegetarian plate was composed of falafel, hummus, tabouli, baba ganoush, dolmades, salad and a block of feta.  I think that the quality of hummus is always a good indicator of what the rest of the food will be like.  I dived right in with my pita and was impressed - it was light and creamy.  The Falafel were also excellent and tasted homemade as opposed to the mixes that other places use.   Usually I hate domades (stuffed grape leaves) - I've had too many bad ones in this town but these were really good.  Tabouli is also something that I am not usually too enthusiastic about but  Mijana's tabouli was fresh and delightful.  Everything on this plate was flavorful and made of excellent ingredients.

There are three massive circular areas for parties, two of which are raised. But you could also have a party at the long tables that are in the center of the floor. There is a full-service bar.\n\nMijana is great for late night feasting and partying. They have Wednesday Salsa night. On other nights they have live bands and they bring in belly dancers. Men and ladies actually do get up and dance. The dance floor was packed the night we stayed there late enough for the dancing. The entertainment is scheduled to start around 9 but it doesn't usually get going until about 10, and they'll stay open as long as people want to party, usually until 1 or 2 am.\n\nThe food is amazing! This is a vegetarian's paradise, though there is plenty of meat. I'm vegan, but one of our meat-eating groups of friends that we brought loved the food. We brought a second group of meat-eaters who didn't care for the meat so much. The vegetarian plates are all amazing. From my point of view, the meat plates look rather boring, but I'm not the one to rely on for a meat review...\n\nOur favorite dishes: \n\n1) Moussaka - (eggplant with chickpeas, onions, green peppers, in an amazingly flavored sauce. AMAZING!\n\n2) Eggplant Rehab - this is an eggplant dip with pita, cucumbers, and tomatoes plus other flavors. It's got a gooey texture and I hear that some Americans are turned off by the look and feel of it, but it's so flavorful. It's one of my favorites. People should get over their fear of goo and try this. Yum.\n\nThe pita is not like other pita you get at most places. It's the best. The hummus, babaganouj, falafal, and all the other vegetarian items are all so good. Vegans -- just make sure you tell them no tatsiki or feta cheese, etc.\n\nOne of the unusual things about this place is that it really doesn't start buzzing until 10 pm. At 10:00, Lebanese families start flooding in and that's when the party begins. Until about 9 or 10, you are likely to be the only people in the restaurant and if you don't know to expect it, you'll be shocked to see the place suddenly on fire after 10.\n\nA couple other things: the owner is so friendly. He has never forgotten us since the first time we discovered his place. And the ambiance of the restaurant is great. It's very nice and there's a patio. The hookah vendor next door will even bring out the hookahs late at night on the weekends for you to smoke.\n\nWe've come for a quiet meal as a couple, we've come to party for my birthday -- and also just to party -- and we've brought our children.

At that time she informed me that they were out of two of the appetizers I ordered.  No Sambusek, no Makanek.  No apologies.  Fine, but the appropriate thing to do would have been to come to the table and inform us about this, and offer something else instead.  Long story short, she mentioned that my Chicken Shawarma Hummus was on its way, more than an hour after I ordered it.  The final appetizer I ordered, would arrive an hour and fifteen minutes after order was placed.\n\nHummus Shawarma (chicken over hummus with pine nuts) My favorite dish of the night, tasted exactly like Pita Jungle's version  (Just costs more).  The chicken was outstanding.  Soft, succulent, and savory.  \n\nGarlic shrimp (saut\u00e9ed shrimp in garlic cilantro)  Second favorite dish.  Generous portion of gorgeously plump prawns, well seasoned and very flavorsome.\n\nWe snickered collectively when the hostess of the evening announced that the entertainment was coming to a close, and that there would be Samba lessons.  I quote, \"I hope that your food has settled so you can enjoy some dancing lessons.\"  Everyone's entrees literally arrived an hour after we had come to the restaurant, right when the hostess opened up the dance floor for some lessons.\n\nThe music was so loud that I had to stuff mine and baby's ears with tissue - we were literally yelling in each other's ears so we could hear one another.  Our sweet baby had an amazing time, though!  She loved the music and the dancers and was captivated the entire time.  We were so lucky to have the entertainment to keep our minds off our growling (roaring) bellies.\n\nOur bill arrived close to 9p, after I once again made the journey to find our server and request the bill.  No thank you's,  no smiles, no apologies from her.  \n\nHowever, I would love to return for future International nights.

If I was basing this review on the look of restaurant alone, with its tall ceilings and long family-style tables, it would certainly get a 5 star rating!\n\nHOWEVER, Mijana is probably the most over-priced and over-rated restaurant in the entire area!\n\nWith Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food not as popular as Italian and Asian fare, many of Mijana's close competitors shut their doors in response to these tough financial times and I can only guess that this lack of options/alternatives is responsible for Mijana receiving any positive reviews at all!\n\nI have eaten here 4 times.  Twice I went with family, two other times I went with friends to see one of the weekend evening dance specials that people I know were performing in.  While I commend Mijana for supporting local dance talent, the restaurant's primary concern should be supporting the paying patrons!  After 2 tries, my immediate family refuses to return and my friends, except for the ones dancing, have not been back!\n\nEach of the 4 times I have gone, the service has become more and more dispicable and the food has only become less and less edible.  \n\nThe reheated pans of low-grade and truly off-tasting ingredients at the buffet only seem like a \"bargain\" for the price until you actually try it.  What doesn't get eaten one night seems to get reheated for the next night's dinner service and the next, etc...\n\nThe food off the regular menu is way overpriced in relation to the quality that ends up on your plate.  The dishes are unoriginal and, despite the fact that the stereotypical Mediterranean/Middle-Eastern fare should be predictable, the only thing you can count on is that it's bland and will probably be cold to the touch by the time the server finally brings it to your table!\n\nThe waitstaff is almost always insufficient (a cost-cutting measure by a greedy owner?) with only 2 servers (if you're lucky) working most weekend dinner services.  Speaking of service, it is consistently the slowest I've ever experienced at any restaurant.  Additionally, food items do not arrive together (members of my group were often served at different times and TWICE we didn't get bread for our Hummus appetizer until AFTER we completed the main courses, even though we made the server aware) and that's just the start!  \n\nBringing any issues to the attention of the floor manager simply results in a dismissive attitude and no results...if he is in a GOOD mood!  When he's not, he'll treat you like a dog.  The way my mom and I were spoken to when we asked about drinks (after a 25 minute wait at the table without even water to sip on) was appalling!  And, the servers could care less.  They don't \"serve\", but they sure don't hesitate to express their upset when the tip is lacking.  You will not leave feeling even remotely appreciated or valued as a customer, I guarantee it!\n\nIf you do decide to dine at Mijana, prepare yourself for a long, expensive night of substandard food and the worst customer care in the Valley!

Cost of gasoline for the round trip from Apache Junction was $8 that we included in our expenses. \n\nThough the online menu said that there were two for one drinks and half-off cold appetizers during 5-7 pm Happy Hour M-F, that had been eliminated, along with the buffet I'd hoped to try from reading Yelp reviews. So that dented our budget from the start. \n\nI'd decided on the lamb shank from the online menu, largely because it said there was a hamburger sauce for the rice, and every Greek and Middle Eastern restaurant where I've had lamb shank, the tomato-based meaty sauce, often with peas, carrots and onions, is the best part of the dish. No sauce of any kind. I asked the waitress, who checked the menu and saw it said a hamburger sauce, and she went to the cook to get some. \n\nHe told her that customers didn't like it so they discontinued the sauce. The menus should be updated to delete references to Happy Hour deals and the sauce. The smallish lamb shank was fine but average without a sauce. Rice was very good--moist and well seasoned. Accompanying salad on the plate had a yogurt and cucumber cup of dressing on the side, pretty bland. \n\nThe babba ghanouj appetizer at $7 was excellent and plentiful, and the freshly baked pita bread is outstanding while warm. The wait staff were pleasant and quick to respond, and the owner or manager came over to personally check on our satisfaction. \n\nWe were the only customers there at 5 pm when they opened, and by 7 when the belly dancer show was to start, there were two other tables of 2 and 4, and two tables of 14 or so that seemed to be of students and perhaps university staff. They seemed enthusiastic about what was to come, and they were eating heartily and having a great time. \n\nSo it was perhaps us, and our expectations of Lebanese food that we've enjoyed elsewhere through the past 50 years, including the Middle Eastern food at Haji Baba's nearby, a small restaurant tucked inside a grocery market. That remains our Middle Eastern favorite in the Phoenix area. Pita Jungle is pretty good, as we remember. \n\nWe'll still be on the lookout for new Middle Eastern restaurants, hopefully with the sauces and tastes we've enjoyed through the years. Good service, other than the waitress bringing my partner's Greek salad entr\u00e9e a good ten minutes before my lamb shank came out. \n\nI'm sure Mijana's is a swinging place once the dancing starts!

Arriving for a 7:30pm reservation we had our pick of tables as there weren't many diners. Given the choice we eagerly sat in an available booth. We both sat on the cushioned seating against the wall. Given our experience I'd recommend sticking with standard chairs, for reasons you may, or may not agree with. \n\n\"Are you ready to order?\"\nBelly dancing is from 7-9pm (ended earlier). A wonderful show is put on near the stage. Tables in the center part of the restaurant (and the booths) have prime viewing. As this was my first visit I fastidiously reviewed the drink menu. To my delight there was a curious mix of drinks available. Margaritas. Long Island Ice Teas. Martinis. J\u00e4germeister - Yeah. That was on there. As a drink. Neat. Nothing quite traditional sounding so I went with wine. In the meantime a glass of water was brought out.\n\n\"Can we help you?\"\n\"Are you ready to order?\"\n\nErm- We'd just opened the drink menus. \nNot quite. I explained this was my first visit.

I suppose so. \n\n36 seconds later -\nWe opted to try the Vegetarian Platter (huge) as an appetizer.  Hummus, Babaghanouj, Tabbouleh, (3) Falafel and (3) Vegetarian Dolmades. That's plenty of food to share with four people. Ambitious for two.\n\nWe were granted time to deliberate our entree order a few more minutes. Instead of the Mixed Grill shared plate (which sounded interesting: skewers of Chicken Kebab, Kefta Kebob and Lamb Kebob) Lamb tempted us. Specifically Lamb Shank and Lamb Kebabs. \n\nThe menu is separated into cold and hot mezzas. We made out like bandits quickly picking what we did. The food is stellar here.\n\nAt this point we began an interesting game I'll call \"Moving of the Plates and Glasses\". We were curious what our entrees might taste like once they were dropped at the table. So we got up and moved them from the far side of the table. You know, within fork reach. Then we slid the appetizer platter out. And the bread plate. And our empty water glasses. And my wine carafe. And the empty beer bottle.

I paused in only what second date behavior in public warranted. \n\n\"Oh? Everything ok?\"\n\"Uh. There was ... a .. bug.\"\n\n(IT WAS RIGHT BY MY HAIR. In the dark.)\nLater I asked my date to describe the bug. It's Arizona. These things happen. He said it could have waved at me. I have little hands. It was bigger than the tip of my thumb.

The grilled vegetables were delightfully seasoned, grilled and layered on top of a wonderful bed of rice. I wish I had grabbed an appropriate photo of the Lamb Shank. This is a dude's platter. Not for a girl on a date! \n\nTHINGS TO KNOW\n+ Service is hit or miss. I finally flagged down a very nice man (possibly a manager) for my 2nd glass of water. \n+ Salsa lessons Fri/Sat night. Lights go off. Disco balls goes on.\n+ Baklava is bone dry and hard. It was difficult to break into bite sized pieces. We returned it. \n+ Turkish coffee is divine!\n+ Time your dinner well before dance class. Service ...changed as dance class preparations began.\n\nDANCE HERE\n+ It's a happening spot.

It looks like they kept the Blue Nile menu, but then expanded it to include more general Middle Eastern dishes.\n\nWe stepped in for lunch, and saw the large advertised sign on the window for $5.99 lunch. There are 2 large menus to choose from. Browsing through the menu, we couldn't find the lunch specials on it anywhere. When I asked the waiter where I could find the lunch specials on the menu though, he vaguely pointed to the 3 pictures on the window in front, and briefly described them. Maybe it's just me, but it's odd to not have at least a printed paper description of your lunch specials at your table if they are so boldly displayed on your window front. Since there were only 3 of them, it would not be that hard to describe or print out!\n\nAnyways, we decided to share the veggie/meat Ethiopian combo ($9.50). My friend asked \"Is it good?\" and the waiter replied almost instantaneously \"It's alright.\" Not very reassuring, no? So we asked what would be better. After some hesitation, he pointed to quite possibly the most benign, Americanized, and uninspiring menu item, the grilled chicken salad. He then went on to say that the combos were quite popular (...But not good?). Faced with this rather odd discourse, we decided to carry on with our plan to get an Ethiopian dish and take the risk!\n\nThe combo came out in fairly quickly. The dish came with grilled beef, chicken, and 3 veggies of your choosing. Unfortunately, despite having the waiter repeating our choices for us and pointing to them on our menu, one of the items was not the right veggie. Despite this mix up, the combo tasted good, and the injera bread went well with the meat and vegetables. \n\nEven though the sign out front says they were open from 11 to 10 that day, they decided to close at 1 P.M. and left the \"Open\" neon sign lit. Quite a few people tried to enter the restaurant only to find out that it was locked. We got there a little after 12 and were still eating when they locked up the door. They let us know that we could take our time and the chef could let us out when we were done, but we felt uneasy being the only customers in there, trapped inside so we left as soon as we finished. I'm not sure if they normally close at 1 P.M., but perhaps changing their signage or leaving a sign describing why you are closed just that day would help clear any confusion.\n\nI used to really like going to Blue Nile for both the food and the service years ago, but since the change in management and name this rather odd eating experience has left me leery to frequent this restaurant again.

I work too far from just about every hummus slinging place in Tempe but Byblos. So I decided to try something new, and was left with a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nFirst off, the place is located in a shitty plaza of decaying shops (home to the Yucca Tap Lounge if that's any indication) and it's right next door to a Mexican food restaurant that I've never seen anyone enter or leave, so it looks like a front for some shady 'business' dealings. But my craving would not be deterred by a craptastic plaza, after all, Capistrano's is in the same plaza and it's delicious. Looks aren't everything. Hummus would be had.\n\nWe enter. It's empty and dumpy looking. The only people here have a mean age of 70. We significantly bring this average down. Waaaay down. We are escorted to a table and peruse the menu. The server (I assume it's the unfriendly server you had, Kelly B., because he looked like he had a stick up his ass that had been festering there for the past 60 years) took our drink orders and came back with two itsy bitsy little cups. Seriously? You're going to charge me 2.50 for six ounces of lemonade? We order. He frowns for the umpteenth time in our short interaction and waddles off to the kitchen. The food arrives.\n\nThe hummus was straight up GROSS, and the pita bread was shockingly similar to cardboard. The hummus tasted sour with a texture that was a combination between chalk and paste. If I can corner a five year old, I'm going to conduct a taste test between the two substances and see if there's any discernable difference. My money's on no. The presentation was nice, with pickles, tomatoes, olive oil and parsley, but if I wrap a piece of dried up dog shit in ribbons and bows, your gift would still be a piece of dried up dog shit. Maybe you could use it as a paper weight? \n\nThe tomato soup that came along with lunch was pretty decent,and the gyro meat was well spiced. But the fact that my gyro was wrapped in the aforementioned cardboard pita bread was really unappetizing. It's like they took rock hard, stale pita bread, heated it in the microwave to make it pliable, molded it and let it cool in its rigid formation. \n\nSo if you're 70 and your senses are slowly numbing, you might like this place. Other than that, stay away. It's unwelcoming and unappetizing. The antithesis of what a restaurant should be.

While the decor could use a serious smack with the pretty stick, the smaller size of the restaurant does make it fairly cozy for family dinners and small gatherings.  \n\nThe older lady and gentleman that run the place are pleasant and good natured, but can be difficult to understand.  Obviously, this has caused several of the negative reviews, but their heavy accents do add something to the experience beyond just the obvious confusion.

However, most of the main entree items are no more than food truck quality pitas and state fair combo plates sold at a premium price.

Also, the bar is limited and the wine selection is nothing short of dreary, though that doesn't stop them from asking fine dining prices on grocery store brands of alcohol.\n\nWhile there's no real \"value\" in the Byblos experience, it's certainly a solid choice when you're just too tired on a Friday evening to drive somewhere else or the inlaws you hate happen to be in town and you absolutely \"must\" take them out!", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "the hummus was a little on the oily side, but everything was great! i only wish that i could have tasted the tomato cram soup everyone raves about...my boyfriend ate it!", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "One of my favorite middle eastern restaurants in the valley!

After we decide what to have, the owner, presumably, walks in from outside, looks at us, and walks over, and tells us that the restaurant is closed. We nervously glanced at each other, and because we thought he was joking, chuckled politely and placed out order. After all, we'd been seated, given silverware, menus, water, and time to decide what to eat. Well, turns out he wasn't kidding. And he apparently thought we were laughing maliciously at him. He grabbed my menu from my hands, told us to get out, that the restaurant was closed, pointed to the door,  and that we need to learn to read signs. Effectively, we were thrown out of the restaurant, and left without commotion or a word to him other than \"ok, ok, we're sorry.\" Sorry for what, other than wanting to patronize a restaurant which I had previously enjoyed, I don't know.

The rice was overwatered, meaning it was mushy and they used too much water when cooking it. The tomato sauce they used to top the rice was good. What shocked me was that they put a small salad in the corner of my to-go box and the lettuce was covered with the warm rice and chicken. Gross. Soggy, warm lettuce. Ew.

Then we waited 10 minutes before anyone came to offer us menus or acknowledge that we were there.  Finally I decided to ask for menus-- gee what a surprise, customers need to see the menus.  We then had to ask for water because NONE was forthcoming without asking.  Maybe they are trying to save the environment, but don't most restaurants ask you what you are drinking?--NOT here.  \nSo now we are set,  we have menus, but we also have questions.  So we ask the young lady in capri pants strutting herself around the restaurant (and especially around the owner)  about the preparation of one of the dishes.  BAD mistake (is there a good mistake????).  She said she didn't know much about the menu.  Aren't employees who interact with customers supposed to know about the menu???  Go to any McDonalds and ask what a BIG MAC is... I am sure they would know!!!!   I digress.\nThe order was a chicken Shawarma sandwich,  Chicken Biryani, and a Vegetable Combo dish ( I think a #20).  Let's start with what I liked.  I thought the combo dish consisting of Hummus, Grape leaves, Falafel, Tabouleah, Babaganoush accompanied by pita was fine.  At $12.95 I don't know if it was fine.  It was a tad expensive compared to other combos at other places.  Regardless, I enjoyed it.  Hubby did not enjoy paying $12.95 for it.  The biggest disappointment was the Chicken Biryani.  It was well spiced but the chicken was overcooked.  When you cook white meat it becomes really stringy.  So all I heard on the way home was how overcooked his chicken was..(keep in mind that I had selected the restaurant).  The real surprise was that my 13 year old granddaughter who ADORES chicken shawarma and all things middle eastern did not enjoy her sandwich.  Don't get me wrong, she ate it.  But when I asked her about it she said, it was a sandwich she would NOT return for.  She then named 3 other middle eastern restaurants who make it better.  \nDisappointing.   I must say that the young lady  who brought us water made up for it by offering water almost to an annoying level.  Maybe it was her way to just strut those capri's in front of the owner.

Updating new profile.**\n\nAfter trying the one in Gilbert several years ago, I was afraid to try this location. But I was hungry from fasting for a blood test and decided to try this location. I won't be going back.\n\nFor the record, this is not the same owner as the one in Gilbert (as I found out), and the food was much better than the one in Gilbert. I ordered a chicken shwarma plate with a side of hummus - to go. Instead of warning me that there's no lunch plate available for shwarma, only pita wraps, I was charged for a full priced dinner.  Nice.  Thanks.\n\nThe \"dinner\" comes with rice topped with a tomato sauce, salad or lentil soup and the shwarma. The shwarma had a great flavor, but was a little dry for my liking. The rice was overwatered, meaning it was mushy and they used too much water when cooking it. The tomato sauce they used to top the rice was good. What shocked me was that they put a small salad in the corner of my to-go box and the lettuce was covered with the warm rice and chicken. Gross. Soggy, warm lettuce. Ew. I cannot comment on the side salad I received because I forgot to tell him that I don't like creamy dressings and it was smothered in it.  My fault for not telling him.\n\nThey don't make their hummus fresh. Their hummus has the consistency and taste of the canned hummus you can buy at Haji Baba's down the street. It was over salted (canning process!) and they used too much oil for the consistency. I threw away my lunch half way through. I can get better food elsewhere.\n\nIf you are not familiar with Middle Eastern cooking, you will find this place good and charming.

The name is quiet deceiving if you were to go on name only and are expecting something like Pita Express with just a variety of pita sandwiches; this is more of a greek/Mediterranean/mid-eastern place along the style of the nearby My Big Fat Greek Express. They basically took the menu of the old place and expanded to include a few more items and have changed a few things.\n\nAs for the food i ordered just a gyro sandwich which was priced pretty cheap at just under $5. After I ordered and sat down then one of the owners(at least I think owner) came over and asked if i would like to try the lentil soup on the house. I said sure and he promptly brought me a bowl. Must say it was pretty good soup, i usually add pepper to my lentil soup but for some reason the flavor of this kept my urge to do so at bay. It was spiced just right, hot and thick not too watery. \n\nThe gyro it self was only ok mostly due to the meat being only luke warm. The flavor of the meat was good but the tzatziki sauce was the real winner here with a good blend of flavors and not overly garlic like with most places. The pita itself was also good nice and warm. Tomatoes were also nice and ripe. This also had a huge pile of meat.\n\nWhile i say 3 star with the meat being a bit warmer this local owned business will surely be a 4 star and I will be back soon", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Sometimes you just want to give an A for effort...\n\nOr maybe more than three lame stars.  As the two other previous reviewers have pointed out succinctly, the man who I assume to be the owner was extremely nice.  I made the 1.5 hour drive from Tucson to watch Avatar at Arizona Mills, and my friends and I decided to grab a bite before heading back.  We randomly drove down Baseline and pretty much stumbled upon this place.  Traffic going westbound towards the 10 was insane.  I mean it was bumper to bumper past Rural.  Anyway, I ask the guy who I assume is the owner why the traffic was so bad.  At first he didn't know, but then realized that the 60 was closed.  He politely recommended that we head south then cut across to get back to the 10.  \n\nI ordered the Jerusalem Falafel sandwich. It was pretty good.  Though, in all honesty, falafel is not one those kind of dishes that one can gush over.  In my opinion, it's pretty hard to mess up deep frying ground chickpeas.  I ought to point out that the ingredients were very fresh.  This also applied to the side salad that comes with the combo meal.  My two friends opted for the gyros, and it looked good.  The meat was thinly sliced, which is somewhat different than others I've had.  They seemed to enjoy the meal, but I don't think they were quite overwhelmed by it either.  In fact, we didn't mention anything about the food during the hour and a half trip back home.  \n\nThe food is by no means bad at Pita Shack.  It's adequate to serviceable in terms of Mediterranean food.  The positives regarding the food have to be its freshness and price.  In fact, I spent no more than $8 for a sandwich, salad, and drink.  The service, as noted previously, is undoubtedly the most shining spot of the place.   As we were finishing up our meal, the guy who I assume is the owner offered us lentil soup on the house.  We declined after being quite filled and satisfied from our respective sandwiches.  I believe another reviewer had the same thing happen to him, and he had positive comments about it.  Now, for me it's was the food that really matters.  Accordingly, I gave three stars, as opposed to the four that I was close to giving.

Too bad that the beef w/ hummus didn't fare as well... The hummus was lacking in the flavor department, and the dry beef chunks really didn't help.

Lunch today using a Groupon- I live in Buckeye so if it wasn't for Groupon I would not go out of my way to give places way off the freeway corridor a shot unless I was in their neighborhood.  We were five miles from Ali Baba today so it was worth a try.  I was very disappointed.  The woman who works in the grocery next door was very personable, I went in there first looking for Zartar bread. She directed me to the bakery that doubles as the dining room.  The cases were sparse, but what was on display looked good.  The menu seemed promising.  My companion had the ubiquitous gyro with fries and a soft drink. I ordered the Ali Baba plate with an order of the yogurt/cucumber \"salad\" on the side, to eat with my entree much as a raita is eaten with Indian cuisine.\n\nTo mimic others, the service was ridiculously slow.  Whoever is working their line must not have professional food service experience, or the kitchen is set up to prepare food for only one table at a time.  I got the impression that they are understaffed, to put it conservatively.  When asked how I wished the meats on my platter prepared, I said I wanted the chicken cooked to 160 degrees but not cooked to death, and the lamb and kufta medium.  When the food was finally served, the meats had been removed from the skewers.  There were four one inch cubes of chicken, four one inch cubes of lamb, and a six inch by one inch by quarter inch high strip of kofta (seasoned ground beef that is formed into oblongs or flatted out on a flat skewer and cooked over a grill.  All the meat was dried out and way overcooked, and I mean way overcooked.  I know that the middle east is not homogenous, and recipes vary, but I wish the kufta was seasoned more robustly with the spices that are found in Egyptian kofta. The seasoning was rather one note. The rice was cooked to perfection and had a good flavor, and there were some middle eastern pickles like strips of turnip pickled in beet juice, a pepperoncini, and cherry pepper slices.  Bread is only served upon request; a nod to our American carb conscious diet, but kind of weird for a middle eastern restaurant.  My experience in the middle east was one where there were huge slabs of bread served with everything.  My yogurt and cucumber salad with mint was amenable, I could have done without the olive oil dripped on top because it was a bitter olive oil, not fruity.\n\nSo, because of the Groupon, the way I look at it is that my entree cost five bucks instead of 15, excluding my cucumber yogurt salad.  I wasn't cheap with the tip, the bill before the discount was twenty six dollars and change and I tipped $5.80.  I don't hold servers responsible for kitchen mistakes, at least not in an environment where the servers don't have any power to change the speed at which the food comes out.\n\nThe worst of it all is that instead of finding a place not too far from home where I can find all my favorite items from the middle east, I found a place that I can't justify the drive to visit in order to give them a second chance.  It's too bad, some of the best food I have ever eaten has been at deli bakerys that put up a few tables in the corner.\n\nSo, guess I have to wait until the next time I fly back east and then hit the Reading Terminal Market in Philly if I want perfectly cooked kufta, kebabs, and chicken.\nBummer...............", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 3, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Enjoyed the food very much and the price is great.

My favorite items were the chicken shawerma sandwich, the falafel (best I ever had) and the rice (made with a bit of saffron and cardamom, and was truly perfection). The Ali Baba sauce is not to be missed- think ranch with a middle eastern twist, and the hummus was a clear winner also. Because my chicken kebabs were a tad dry (still flavorful), I would likely opt for the chicken shawerma next time. The beef shawerma was nice and tender as well. Some people had seasoned fries with their meals, and they were delish. Kids (and adults) would be pleased with this non-middle eastern option.

There were already a few people finishing up dinner.  First we ordered the Baba ghanoush for the appetizer.  It arrived fast enough with freshly baked Pita Bread on the side.  The Baba ghanoush was excellent.  Very Fresh and home made taste with just a bit of spice.  The bread was chewy and warm and was the perfect compliment to the acidity of the Eggplant and the olive and spices.  The Main Dish was a Chicken  Shawarma Plate.  It consisted of sliced pieces of Chicken,  Rice, picked middle eastern vegtibles, and some yogurt on the side.  The Chicken was very flavorful and moist.  I would expect the meat to be fresh and good because the Butcher is right next door.    I loved the picked Vegetable that accompanied the Chicken, it set off a nice balance to the spiciness of the meat.  The rice was perfectly made  and the dish as a whole was quite tasty.  If you need some more spice, ask for a side of chili sauce.  I'm not sure what it was, a mixture of sriracha sauce and something else perhaps.  What ever it was, it was very complimentary to the main dish.  I also ordered a side Middle Eastern Salad.  It was very tasty but I probably would recommend that they add some more olives and other pickled veggies as it seemed a little lacking with lettuce and salad dressing the main component of the salad.

Oh well:  if you can't deal with having to take a pilgrimage to eat in Phoenix, then don't move out to the middle of nowhere in the West Valley, right?\n\nActually, we were very happy we overcame our objections to taking out a second mortgage on the house to buy enough gas for the car and spent the 45 minutes one way to come to Ali Baba's.  Definitely worth the drive.\n\nThe other half decided to go with an order of baba ganoush as an appetizer and a chicken shwarma as his main dish; I chose a variety of appetizers as my main meal:  a combo plate, which came with dolmas, falafel and hummus; a side order of baba ganoush and one of labna.\n\nRight off, we were delightfully surprised by the baba ganoush, which came to the table.  While most of the baba ganoushes I've had are either smooth like hummus or a little lumpy, this one had large chunks of eggplant in it and a pleasantly smoky taste.  Obviously, they must get a number of compliments about it, because while in the middle of my speech about how I've been to Middle Eastern restaurants all over the world and this baba ganoush was one of the best I've tasted, she was already thanking me out of anticipation  (or maybe she could tell I was on the cusp of launching a pompous pronouncement and thought she could cut me short before my speech took up all her time before closing time 3 hours away?!).\n\nSpeaking of 'chatty', as one of the reviewers stated in a review from 20 August 2013, I would not say the proprietor is 'chatty'.  She's from an area north of NYC -- though she hasn't lived there for more than 30 years -- and I would describe her as being \"forthright\" and \"direct\".  This might be a bit unnerving to a lot of people out west, who tend to be reserved and not gregarious with outright strangers; but this gregariousness is very typical of New Yorkers and can be quite charming and amusing to those familiar with it  (see?  I told you, I was pompous and chatty!).\n\nThe labna was also quite good and very creamy.  While thick, it seemed to melt in your mouth like smooth butter and I suspect that's the olive oil doing its job.  The big surprise for me, however, was the combo appetizer plate:  the dolmas were nothing to really talk about --- your standard, small and moist ones you can get out of a can (which may or may not be the case here, as they had a taste atypical of canned dolmas).  The prize for obviously-homemade dolmas still goes to The Golden Greek and Haji Baba, whose dolmas -- while distinctly different from one another -- are obviously made in-house and are very good.  The falafel were cute, small, muffin shaped and moist.  They did fall apart easily when you put fork to them even though they were moist; and I don't know what this means in terms of \"falafel culture\" (i.e., whether that's good or not).  The hummus was surprisingly thin and liquidy, which, considering how thick the labna and baba ganoush was, really surprised me.  Still, quite tasty.  All of this is served with copious amounts of bread, which I would NOT classify as pita (especially as the partner's chicken shwarma was on 'standard' pita).  This bread was almost like a 'double-pita':  thick, well toasted, crunchy.  Especially useful in scooping up the thick baba ganoush.  The size of the appetizer portions were quite large and thus very reasonably priced.\n\nMy partner assures me that the chicken shwarma was very good, with thick pieces of chicken and a sauce much better than at, say, Haji Baba, which we use as the Gold Standard against all Middle Eastern restaurants in the Valley.  How unfortunate, that this restaurant, which measures up very good against Haji Baba, and in some respects passes it, is as far away or further from us than Haji Baba in the East Valley!\n\nAt $1.99 per piece, the baklava is reasonably priced and the portions generous.  While not swimming in lemon juice and honey -- which, I admit, I'm partial to -- it is very moist.  We both found it to be very sweet, but, to be fair, we generally avoid sweet foods, so our opinion on that should be taken with ... a grain of sugar? ... whatever.  The strong Turkish coffee does offset that sweetness.\n\nThe only 'negative' in this whole review is the lighting.  Like many restaurants in the Valley, this one is in an office in a strip mall, which was never designed to be a restaurant.  Thus, it has the 'standard' tiled ceiling with fluorescent lights.  It is obvious by the decoration in the restaurant, sparse as it is, that a lot of effort was taken to give the atmosphere a Middle Eastern ambience and to overcome the harshness and inhospitable feeling of being in an office.  Unfortunately, the fluorescent lighting, while no doubt efficient, casts a pale, bright light over everything and this overwhelms what is otherwise very nice decor.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Ran into this place by accident but because I lived in the Middle East for 5 years thought we would give it a try.

We were the only customers in the restaurant the entire night, so there was not much to describe in terms of the atmosphere.\n\nThe Hummus with Pita ($3.99) came with blended chickpea, tahini, lemon, garlic, tomato, olives, and pickled veggies. The Hummus was excellent, as the smooth chickpea and tahini stood out to follow the sharp garlic and lemony backdrop. All the sharp flavors worked in concert with their warm homemade pita bread. The bread was thick, soft, spongy, highly addictive, and served piping hot. It was so good that I can imagine eating this pita bread all day long and not get tired of it. It was a fantastic option for the price.\n\nThe Ali Baba Combo ($14.99) came with three skewers of lamb, kufta, chicken kabob, pickled veggies, and basmati rice.

One of the reviewers mentioned that the sauce was mayo based, but the combination was still worthwhile for the price. \n\nPrices were fantastic but I'm giving this place a lower rating because the food took an hour to arrive.

I guess she just wanted to try something different.\n\nFor starters we tried the Combination Platter which consisted of Hummus, Babaghanoush, and Falafel Balls with Pita Bread. \n\nI warned my friend, and any person reading this review, that Greek cooking combines herbs unlike no other country in Europe. You have to like the flavor of oregano, mint, garlic, onion, dill and bay leaves, basil, thyme, and grape leaves. Feta (Goat) Cheese is used often in their salads. And their desserts are characterized by the use of nuts and honey.\n\nSuki could tell by my friend's facial expressions that Greek spices were not to his liking; she recommended the Cairo Special as an entree - Egyptian Chicken and Mediterranean Beef combination. The Egyptian Chicken was slightly overcooked, but had a sweet aftertaste which was interesting. The Mediterranean Beef was excellent.\n\nI ordered the Lamb Shish Kabob - which consisted of two big skewers filled with gigantic pieces of Lamb, Onions, Green Peppers and Tomatoes! The Lamb was the tenderest I had in years - EXCELLENT! Of course, you have to like Lamb...\n\nFor dessert my friend had the Cheesecake - unfortunately store bought. I had the Baklava, which was delicate and light, with two small cups of Turkish Coffee! The coffee was not as strong as coffee I had in Europe, but is probably the best in Phoenix. (When you drink Turkish Coffee... Stir the coffee OFTEN! Grounds from the coffee will settle to the bottom if you don't... then you'll be drinking Turkish Mud! And stir in about 2-3 teaspoons of sugar, which makes it taste GOOD! I know you're going to say \"that much sugar!\" when you see such a small cup... trust me! When I was in Europe, my friends would often take me to breakfast establishments that would serve Turkish Coffee.

Heidi E. and I are friends, but sometimes friends don't agree. Maybe it's a matter of different tastes, or even different experiences, who knows, but I have a very different take on Med House.\n\nI've been eating at Mediterranean House regularly for the last 6 or 7 years. Started with a group of business friends for occasional lunches, then for dinners with my partner, and now it's a couple times a month for take out. (Have to say I prefer take-out for a few reasons: convenient, neighborhood spot; food travels well; only beer + wine when dining in.)\n\nI find the food here to generally be great - though not always consistent, have had one or two just so-so dinners. That said, when the kitchen is on, the food can be spectacular. We usually order the same few dishes - one of the chicken plates and the gyros platter. \n\nMy favorite chicken plate is the Olympic Chicken, which is grilled chicken breast with a really delicious black olive sauce. The Moroccan Chicken is also really good, and maybe a little healthier with it's herbed breasts, honey-yogurt sauce and side of carrots, apple and spinach (which is not cooked, just shredded, but surprisingly good.) If you want rich flavor, go for the Egyptian Chicken, which is pan-fried in parmesan cheese and herbs. If you want spicy, go for the Chicken Shushka, which is more stew-like, flavored with lots of paprika. \n\nThe Gyros platter is a standard favorite, though Med House does it a little different. No shredded lamb here - instead, you get 4 long pieces of juicy, tender meat. I think the quality is better this way, and it makes for a nice dinner presentation. Pita and house-made yogurt-cucumber sauce are still the perfect accompaniments, and If you like spicy, ask for the spicy green sauce - some kind of minced hot green peppers - the flavors match the gyros meat perfectly.\n\nHummus and Baba Ganouj appetizers are just OK, I suggest the Lentil soup instead - vegetarian, made from scratch, delicious and hearty. Salad is OK as well - dressing can be a little too citrus-y or vinegar-y for my taste, but always fresh feta and crisp veggies. Love the rice pilaf, with almonds and apricots, and the 2 pasta sides - fettucine with creamed spinach or angel hair pasta with sundried tomato and feta - both are rich with flavor.\n\nIf you're interested in trying Mediterranean House, I suggest sooner rather than later, as the strip mall where they're located may be seeing some major changes. The building owner has told tenants he'll not be guaranteeing any leases, and most tenants are already gone. Unfortunately, if Med House loses their lease, they may not reopen at all.

Crispy on the outside, moist and tasty on the inside.  It's not overly oily and I've never had a dry falafel ball. And they're just the right size, about the size of a pinball. Occasionally I'll get a batch that is only slightly warmed up instead of freshly cooked, but they're still quite good.\n\nThe falafel sandwich is fine -- there are four or five balls in a pita with fresh lettuce, tomato and tahini for under $5 (I think) -- but I prefer the a la carte order, 5 piece falafel with a side of tahini and fresh pita for a couple bucks. I usually order that as an appetizer,  to share with others or eat myself in addition to a sandwich when I'm extra hungry.\n\nOther than the falafel, I'm partial to the chicken gyros sandwich or plate. It's pieces of grilled chicken breast with lots of yummy middle eastern spices (which I think are still made and sold on premises) and caramelized onions. Couple that with tsatziki sauce + fresh pita and you've got one heck of a meal.\n\nIf you've got a sweet tooth, try the rice pudding, it's excellent.

They offer food for everyone who enjoys Middle eastern cuisine, from meat eaters to vegetarians, and even have gluten free options. \nI myself today asked the owner what he suggested and I decided to order that. \nHe suggested the Lebanese Chicken that came with a Greek salad, rice and a pita.\nHe also gave me some of their famous lemonade as well. Now this lemonade mind you was reviewed by New Times as the best lemonade in Phoenix. Now I know why, it's pleasantly sweet and refreshing, sweetened with rose water if my taste buds serve my memory right. \nMy meal was delicious and filling in every aspect I wished it to fill.\nThe Greek salad was salty and tangy just like it should be, now I'm not normally a Greek salad guy, as I'm not going to join an olive lover's guild but this Greek salad changed my opinion on olives.The salad contained pickled beets, tomatoes, red onions, lettuce, olives, cucumbers, and their dressing.  It was great, to put things short and sweet. \nThe pita, was soft as a pillow but tasty, unlike a pillow, don't ask me how I know a pillow isn't tasty. The pita was warm, soft, delicious and I used it to clean my plate clean after I finished my meal to absorb what remaining flavors were left behind, just so I wouldn't waste them.\nThe rice was wonderful, it had tons of flavor, and not overpowering. They gave a large amount of it as well, which for me, a big fan of rice, mad this meal even better. The rice contained peas mixed in and I think saffron.\nThe chicken I had was delicious as well, it was chicken breast, in a lemon and herb spice, grilled. It wasn't too salty and the flavor wasn't overpowering. All of the items in the dish accompanied each other well.\nAll of these items together as a meal were very fairly priced too. After AZ sales tax, my meal came to $9.83. \nI will definitely go again, this time to try a vegetarian option and I highly recommend you going as well.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I love, love this place!

Sadly, my disappointment could've been entirely avoided. More on this later. For now, know that the three stars is for the food, only. I'd rank service and atmosphere at -5 stars, if I could. \n\nI ordered the chicken souvlaki pita with a side salad (I think french fries are the default side.) While it wasn't bad, especially for the price, I wished the pita sandwich had a *little* more romaine and that it weren't drowning in tzatziki sauce. The salad was OK and I must admit I didn't clarify with the person at the counter, but I wouldn't call it a Greek salad, which I thought would be pretty standard in a Greek restaurant. It contained romaine, tomato, cucumber and creamy vinaigrette, but there was no sign of Greek salad staples like feta cheese or kalamata olives. The combo comes with a choice of soda in a can. \n\nSo why was I disappointed? It was the shouting match that was taking place in the kitchen. From what I could tell, another customer had complained their delivery order was taking too long to arrive and the staff (probably the owner and the delivery person) had a heated (to put it mildly) discussion about it. It got so loud that other patrons and I in the dining area couldn't even hear the TV. There was plenty of profanity which doesn't bother me too much, but it could bother others, especially those with kids in tow. I was mostly offended by the fact one of the men in the kitchen boldly proclaimed an order of $15 would be a priority over a $6 order, regardless of which party had placed their order first. (I guess that explains why I had to wait 23 minutes for one combo.) Further, the woman at the counter seemingly is stuck having to take the heat when customers complain by phone and once she was brought into the shouting match, she was literally brought to tears. \n\nUltimately, customers go to restaurants for food, relaxation, sometimes atmosphere etc. They don't go to see/hear a real-life soap opera. Getting orders out in a timely fashion, handling customer dissatisfaction, etc are operational tasks that every restaurant faces and this should have been worked out in a customer-focused way and behind closed doors...period. Customers on the dining area have no interest in hearing about the \"f*****g pressure\" you're under, don't want to see the staff brought to tears and certainly don't want to hear the $6 order they've placed was lower on your priority list than a $15 order. It's unprofessional, plain and simple.

About the only thing I can agree with is that the owner seems like a friendly, accommodating chap. Went here for lunch today with a friend.  First thing we saw upon turning into the parking lot was a slow-moving drunkard swaying and staggering about holding a super slurper which I'm sure was full of cheap wine cut with drano. Definitely an extremely dingy mall, and in fact this little hole in the wall place wasn't much better. Chairs with ripped vinyl, for example. Grabbed a couple of menus and sat down. We were asked what we wanted to drink. The drinks turned out to be cans in a fridge on the other side of a couple of tiny saloon doors, almost actually in the kitchen area. Basically implying no free refills. We were asked to help ourselves. Fair enough. My friend asked for ice. The guy said that they didn't have any but they'd go grab some - and that's what happened! One of the staff came back with a bag of ice purchased from somewhere outside, like a gas station? Anyway, chilled glasses and ice followed - I didn't use mine because I don't really feel bagged ice is exactly something I want to drink, versus ice made from filtered water (shrug). Anyway. A little odd so far. We ordered some appetisers, $5 each for 4 falafel pieces. The guy said that the falafel plate was a better deal, $6 for 6 pieces total. Fair enough, appreciate the tip.\n\nFalafel comes out first. Didn't really like it. They looked more like small Pepperidge Farm cookies than the traditional \"Monet haystack\" shape, and tasted mealy and undercooked. Hummus was more like babaghanoush consistency and not particularly flavourful. Plates came out. Mine was $9.95 for the chicken shawarma. The rice appeared to be long-grain basmati, tasted ok but several of the grains were dry and crunchy, to the point that my friend commented later that he thought he had broken and crunched on a tooth filling. There wasn't enough chicken on the plate. The pita bread served on our plates and on the falafel one was the sort that upon losing its warmth turns basically into shoe leather and would challenge a rabid dog in terms of tearing and chewing. The salad was ok and the dressing was pretty good, but I wasn't there for a salad. The presentation of the meal on the plate was good. Pic here: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/athens-gyros-phoenix?select=P8-8ovsHCLqfCf_zqQ8uUg#R8njJz2kWGJWNO74b5WL5Q - but for perspective, the palm of my hand could have covered the amount of chicken provided.\n\nI've had far better Greek meals. Wow. For something that's truly fresh and delicious in this style of cuisine I always fall back on old faithful, Greek Wraps on Bell near 75th Ave. This didn't even come close in terms of taste. Not even in the same suburb, let alone ball park. $17 with tip for my meal, and I was still hungry afterward.

I haven't had good, let alone great, Lebanese food in eons since I left Pittsburgh, PA, in 1990! (Okay, just once in all that time, and it was in Montreal (the same folks who catered Celine Dion's wedding)! A little too far to visit on a regular basis.)  Now, I have found my go-to place when I crave all my favorite  Lebanese goodies - like hummus, babaganoush, stuffed grape leaves . . . and the choices go on!\n\nOriginally, we were just ordering take-out, but the owners, two of three brothers, were there and offered us some samples of their dishes. I was blown away by the smoky, flavorful babaganoush. It was not pureed to pieces so you could still enjoy the texture of the eggplant as well. My husband wolfed down the roasted red pepper hummus and was smacking his lips the entire time -- best he ever tasted. I am always up for trying something new, and we received a small dish of Majadara which is steamed lentils and cracked wheat mixed with onions, a Lebanese traditional dish that I never tried or even heard of before. Mmmm, it was delicious . . . lovely texture, seasoned just right . . . a perfect combination of protein and carbs . . . great as a meal on its own for lunch!  We chatted for quite a while with owners Tater and Mohammed, asked about how they got into the restaurant business, how they arrived in Scottsdale, and learned more about their chef, who is also a butcher and does his own meat! They were all so friendly and really excited about bringing their family recipes and homemade Lebanese to Scottsdale. \n\nOur take-out was ready! We ordered the original hummus, baba, fried eggplant, grape leaves with meat and rice, and the mixed grill. I was so full from the samplings, I had to wait a couple hours before I could begin to take a bite of the food we brought home! The hummus is creamy and no overwhelmed by the taste of tahini. A little bit of olive oil drizzled in the mix as they advised at the restaurant made it simply divine.  I don't even need the pita . . . I could just eat this by the spoonful, along with the baba as noted above.  The fried eggplant was a surprise. I guess I was expecting something like fried zucchini, with breading, but instead this was more like sauteed with lemon garlic sauce. Yum! \n\nThe grape leaves were tightly rolled, like little cigars, and served hot! I haven't had grape leaves with meat in them in a very long time . . . and maybe not ever in Scottsdale. They were the creme de la creme in my experience, just as I remembered those 20 years ago in Pittsburgh.  It was quite funny because my husband only knows grape leaves as \"dolmades\" which is Greek. When he ordered, the self-proclaimed \"white\" girl behind the counter taking our order didn't have a clue what it was he was ordering. Anyway, no where on the menu was the word dolmades, only grape leaves . . . guess you had to be there for the looks on both their faces.\n\nThe Mixed Grill was a savory, well-seasoned, very tender mix of Kabob, Kafta and Tawook, served with various veggies over rice. It came with a side salad . . . which as of last night, we were both too tired and full to dig into, so maybe later.The Kafta was extraordinary! And I am not a meat eater by any means. My husband dug all the way in and polished off everything, except some of the rice which surely he will gobble up today!\n\nBefore we left the restaurant, Temar gave us a couple pieces of baklava to satisfy our sweet teeth! And as we were already out the door, the very friendly chef came running after us to give us a little taste of the kabob meat he just cooked up! Oh we were so happy . . . and in such a food coma!  Tummy full, nap now!\n\nWithout a doubt, we will be back to The Mediterranean Grill.  I only wish we lived close enough to take advantage of their 5-mile delivery option.

The falafel were deep fried for so long that they were clearly burned on the outside, dark-dark brown almost blackened. There was no moisture, none, left in them. The shell of the falafel, what should have been a thin crispy crust, had turned into a half an inch thick uncrackable concrete-like substance. I had to hack away at it (really) with my knife to get at the inside, which was dry and tasted like sawdust with a tiny hint of chickpea.\n\nAND because I didn't want to ruin my friends birthday by complaining about my food, I ate it like a good little girl and suffered a massive stomach ache for the rest of the evening.

Turkish food and hot summer's night seemed appropriate meal-fellows so when a spare table at Hanam's on the terrace overlooking Victoria Street and Grassmarket appeared, I jumped on it.\n\nFirst off, they don't sell alcohol. It's BYOB with all beer, wine and cider on the menu being \"dealcoholised\". And the pear cider is pretty sweet, just like drinking pear juice with pear drops added.

The trio of dips we ordered came with a surprisingly nice, big, fluffy, puffy bread that was like a mix between a naan (in appearance) and a pitta (in taste). Two of those in fact.

I'll have cravings of the lamb chops for the next few months thanks to this place.\n\nOkay here's the story, Buddy and I planned on hitting up Mother's Korean BBQ in China town. I no longer felt up to it and decided i needed a Kebab (I dont care to me it's KE-BAB, i talk about KE-BABS with my British and Australian friends it's not a kah-bob it's KE-BAB). My buddy works around the area and orders delivery at least twice a week. TWICE A WEEK?! other then rice i dont eat anything twice a week willingly. We GOTTA check this place out.\n\nWe arrived at 9:45 and closing is at 10:00. The staff allowed us to dine in regardless of their closing time. Our waitress was brand new and possibly fumbled our order so another waitress came over to confirm everything. Now some would consider this an annoyance because they should have got it right the first time but i actually approve of this. It's better to ask again and get it right rather then follow through only to discover someone made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWe both ordered #19s (Combo Kebab) but with personal touches. \nI had a straight 19 which has Rice, Salad, Grilled Chili & Tomato, A Pork Chop, two of each Chicken & Beef Kebabs, and a Beef Lula kebab.\n\nBuddy had the same but replaced his rice with half rice half fries, all beef kebabs, and a chicken lula.\n\nWe also had a side of lamb chops were were...what ever i'll say it...ORGASMIC \n\nRice: had that classic flavor found in middle eastern, indian, and mediteranean cuisine. I have been unable to replicated and havent found a female of listed above ethnicity to date so the rice will still impress me until i learn it's secrets. \n\nBeef Kebab: Perfectly seasoned not too dry but not all that juicy. Had a lot of flavor and was very tender. Epic Win\n\nChicken Kebab: Same as the beef but with chicken. Epic Win\n\nBeef Lula Kebab: Nice flavor but the texture is what got me, it seemed softer then burger meat but had twice the flavor. The overly soft texture didnt sit too well with me but then again i ate it all. Epic uh...not sure if i like it but there's no trace of it on my plate\n\nChicken Lula Kebab: Perfect just perfect, the flavors and most importantly the texture was perfect. Epic Perfection\n\nPork Chops: No impact No idea. All i know is it fits VERY nicely in the to go box. Not a small pork chop either mine covered nearly half the plate. Epic Breakfst\n\nSide of Lamb Chops: Words can not begin to describe...Should have sent a Poet. In all seriousness i was ready to throw my entire plate on the floor and completely devote the next few minutes to munching on these lamb chops. We as Americans need to embrace Lamb more...Epic Lamb\n\nHaving a salad on the side is a very nice way to balance out the savory and the salty with crunchy tartness. The Pita bread wasnt fresh but i cant expect more when they stayed open late to accommodate us very close to their closing time. \n\nOverall two combo plates, two sodas, customization on one of the combo plates, and a side of 4 pieces of lamb chops for 40 dollars.\n\nWAIT WHAT?!?! 20 quid per person?! that's a 22oz steak @ the Cortez Room...That's All you can eat Korean BBQ @ Sula...here 20 bucks not only got us each a combo plate but the Lamb too?! \n\nSorry my other favorite place for cheap eats you've already been forgotten and replaced with Shish Kebab House...", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 5, "useful": 4, "cool": 4}}, {"text": "Thank you, Tien N.

My beef kabob and lula kabob were pretty good and lamb is definitely to try next time. The LuLa was nicely seasoned and the beef kabob was tender and juicy. This isn't really \"Mediterranean\" but I guess it's easy to lump it instead of call this Armenian. Salad was good and fresh and added a bit of the \"wetness\" the meal needs, but I still think maybe the meats should come with a sauce. Rice is buttered and they use jasmine rice so it is soft and not dry at all.  The plate had roasted tomato which was yummy to mix into the food and had a roasted pepper which I thought was the usual mild sweet peppers most Mediterranean places give. Beware- its a spicy pepper and I took a big mouthful like an idiot. Delicious in small bites, but not so much in a mouthful...ouchie. \n\nNext time I'll see if they can do a small dipping cup of their cucumber yogurt.

That was 11.95.  It was served with an enormous portion of tasty rice, mixed salad, and very good pita.\n\nWe started with hummus and tabbouleh salad for appetizers; the tabbouleh was excellent.  The hummus was bland, and needed more garlic or other seasoning.\n\nBut the lamb chops - oh, what lamb chops!  Moist, tender, perfectly cooked.  In a word, stupendous.  The other meats were very good, too, and they will be tomorrow's dinner, along with still too much rice.\n\nThis restaurant is Armenian, as was our waitress, Sophie, who was excellent - friendly, efficient, and accommodating.

We told her that there was nothing saying that they'd only take one, and she passed the buck to her absent boss.  Still, the bill was exceedingly reasonable, and split five ways, it came out to only $15 a person before tip, and that included the two appetizers, a beer, wine, coke, and a yogurt drink (sour yogurt with mint - yecch - but the friend who ordered it loved it).\n\nFor parties of 10 or more, they have a 7.95 special that is a full meal.

However, even though they were over cooked, they still tasted good with only a mild gamey flavor. Overall, I'd give the main entree a 3.0\n\nThe service however was excellent. Our server was attentive and persistent. He had a cheery demeanor, happily provided us with our special requests (extra lemons ~ great drizzled over the lamb chops, and tabasco sauce for my brother in law's lula kabob.)

They had a birthday party celebration and the restaurant was fully booked which my have accounted for the food being over cooked as in previous dining experiences, according to my sister, the food was much better prepared. \n\nTips: They accept Restaurant.com gift cards, bring a little extra soy sauce to complement the rice (my nephew's advice), and request for the salad dressing to be served on the side.

The humus comes in a large tub and they constantly refill the pita basket.  It is a lot of food.  You will be tempted to fill up on it while waiting for your entree.  The food takes a really long time to come out.  They are so slow.  While waiting we admired the dining area.  Seems to be well decorated.  Not many guests, but lots of family hanging around.  Turns out the place is Armenian, not Greek.  I know nothing of Armenian cuisine, but seems the same to me.  The food finally arrived and the portions were big.  Everything seemed super fresh.  The meat and grilled veggies were hot, juicy, and flavorful.  I love this food.  Plus, grilled items are healthier.  The meat was so juicy, not dried out.  The jalapeno pepper was hot.  I like slicing the tomato on the bed of rice.  The juices run and the rice soaks up the flavor.  I ordered the #19 Combo Kabob $14.95, which came with one pork chop, four pieces of beef kabob, and four pieces of chicken kabob.  Although it was good, I liked the pork chop the least.  My wife ordered the #5 Beef Lula Kabob $8.95.  It is like an uncased sausage grilled on a stick.  The seasoning was wonderful.  I think all entrees come with a Mediterranean salad, pita, grilled tomato, grilled jalapeno pepper, and white rice.  We could not finish the food and had to get a to-go-box.  I could not leave without a piece of baklava.  It taste good, but one little piece cost $2.95.  I think that cost too much for such a small piece.

Assuming it is a \"Middle Eastern\" restaurant, the waitress proudly mentioned it is actually an  Armenian Restaurant, but most of the dishes are interpretations of popular  \"Mediterranean dishes\".  I stand corrected, seriously, I appreciate the correction.  \n\nLet's start from the beginning.  Waited to be seated about 2 minutes, but was graciously welcomed once acknowledged.  While waiting, I notice the decor was tasteful, simple, yet warm and the lighting soft, which distracted for the asbestos drop ceiling.  We were then seated and no one came back for atleast 10 minutes. I really wished someone would have dropped off atleast water and asked if we had any questions, but when the waitress came, her full attention was on us. \n\nAt first, I wish the menus were a bit more sophisticated than a two-sided laminated 8 x 11 page with low resolution pictures and prices...even the wine menu looked like more effort was spent on it, thought it was also a laminated page, just better paper.  However, given the price point of the food (bargain!), pleasant setting, and nice service when attention is on you, who really cares?\n\nWe ordered our alcoholic drinks and our main entrees.  The wine list has ordinary wines (Yellowtail, Columbia Two-Vines), but all so had a few wines from their homeland.  However, regrettable I ordered a Two-Vines Merlot instead of trying Areni (Sp?), a dry red wine from either Armenia or neighboring Georgia.  My husband initially ordered a beer listed on their menu, but no longer have, the waitress sweetly and proudly convinced my husband to try one of their Armenian beers, which he was pleasantly surprised at the quality and taste.  Wines are pleasant prices around $5 bucks, beers are even a bit less.\n\nIt took about 5 more minutes to receive our drinks and wine, and about 20 minutes to receive our food.  I took this as a good sign that the food was cooked to order, when ordered. I had the lamb chops.  The waitress happily obliged my request to substitute additional salad for rice or fries.  My husband ordered the Beef Lulu and beef kebab.  The food: Beyond expectations, it came out hot, freshly made/prepared as requested, and very, very tasty, especially given the price point.   Honestly, I have been at restaurants that have lamb chops on the menu which are half the portion at twice the price, and nothing was prepared as well as Shish Kebab House....even my husband devoured my other two chops as he constantly expressed that they didn't taste \"gamey\".  Thanks hun, for finishing off my lunch tomorrow.  (LOL)\n\nI love the waitress' confidence and pride in the food she served.  She chuckled as she confirmed we were pleased with our dishes, since there was nothing left on our plates.  What she doesn't even know is that we weren't even \"hungry\" yet we \"managed\" to finish our food.  \n\nWhile service is a bit slow for my liking, the waitress was polite and there is no denying this is good food for a good value.

Waited twice as long as estimated time, price of food was 3 dollars higher than told over the phone.  Service was unexpected and saddening.\n\nI logged back onto yelp after two years just to write a review for Shish Kabob House.  Before I continue any further I would like to say that the food is definitely fine, however; much is to be desired in my opinion with the service.\n\nOrder: Chicken Lula with Beef Kabob.\n\nOrdered at 11:59 am, I was told over the phone that this specific combination is not available on the menu.  The order taker re-assured me that it's fine, she will put it in and that my total will come out to be 9.95 since it comes as a \"special order\".  I am fine with this, any other order that relates to this one is around 9.95 and 8.95.  This is completely reasonable.  The order will be ready in ABOUT 15 minutes.\n\nI arrive at the restaurant at 12:04, much earlier than anticipated.  One waitress (out of three) notices me after sitting for about 5 minutes and proceeds to ask me if I have been seated.  I inform her that I ordered over the phone and that I am aware it should not be ready.  She is friendly and acknowledges my comment and continues to do her job.   \n\nThe next time I check my phone is 12:22.  I look around and see there are a maximum of six tables occupied in the restaurant.  I sit for another three minutes, and that is when the same waitress is kind enough to check on my order for me.  12:27, a gentleman walks in and is immediately seated, and his food arrives a minute after himself.  I can only assume this gentleman had also ordered his food over the phone.  By this time I realize EVERYONE has their food.  At least two tables excluding the lone gentleman came after me.  \n\nAt 12:29:50 (which is what the receipt says) I am handed my check by the same waitress and am told that my total will be $12.92.  Absent-minded I hand my card over, but I catch myself as she is ringing me up.  \n\n----------What occurs next is what I am most discontent over---------\n\nUp until this point I have waited patiently for 30 minutes on an order that was supposed to take 15 minutes.  During those 30 minutes I watched as everyone got their food, people before I came in and after I came in.  \n\nI stopped the waitress and explained that perhaps the price is wrong, and that I was told over the phone it was going to be $9.95.  Immediately I got a tone and haste that I only know too well myself having worked over two years in the service in industry; \"I work here and I know I am right, let me not only prove it, but also now try to rush our interaction so I can continue my job.\"  I was not questioning her knowledge of the service at the store, and up until this point she was extremely friendly and attentive.  She proceeded to show me the menu and the $11.95 priced Beef Kabob and explain her reasoning, to which she stated three times in rapid succession the reason why it's $12.92 is because \"it is an inconvenience for the chefs\".  However; EVERY combos item (beef lula/chicken kabob, etc) is in the 8.95-9.95 range.  So how is it I am being charged three dollars MORE for a beef kabob/chicken lula combo if there are combos with a beef kabob only priced at 9.95?  I informed her again that I was told a lower price over the phone, and she curtly \"apologized\" for whoever took my order.   I was handed the card receipt and left at the counter, to which I signed and left the establishment with no acknowledgement or thank you.  \n\nI don't mind paying for food.  I don't mind if I end up having to pay extra for someone else's mistake.   I don't mind waiting longer.  I don't mind watching everyone get their food before me even though they arrive later than myself.  \n\nWhat I DO mind is being given horrible attitude for a mistake that was NOT made by myself.  Of course I don't want to pay extra for something that was originally going to be another price, and there should be an air of courtesy tied to that.  Our time could has easily been resolved is I was told, \" I'm very sorry about that, our waitress made a mistake.  I realize also that your order took much longer than expected, allow me to charge you the price that was discussed over the phone.  However; for next time this same combination will cost you $12.92.\"\n\nWhat I wrote above is acceptable service.  That is courteous service.  That is service that will make me return again and again.  I would return JUST for the same combination at $12.92 if that was the conversation we had. But that is not the case.  Instead I was treated as if \"these mistakes happen often and that I need to suck it up and pay and leave.\"  If we weren't jostling over three dollars, they would have made way more in my return.\n\nAlthough the food was fine, the experience left a very sour taste in my mouth.

With appetizer (Domas), we were given the store bought and cold PITA bread (Notice the caps) with nothing to dip it with and with no butter. Rice with the order of # 7 were the type of rice they serve with Enchiladas. Chicken Kabobs were dry and the beef kabobs were unevenly cook. Some were well done while other were mid-well.

Our server was very polite and gave a very professional impression. Halfway between ordering and getting our food, the music stops causing an uncomfortable amount of silence. 5 mins later, it resumed again. I couldn't actually tell where the music was from, didn't sound like Arabic or Persian. Could be Pashto.\n\nIn short, if you go for the food, don't expect anything close to Fresh Kabob on Sunset/Eastern where they serves fresh bread and Basmati rice. Pay $14 for plate with 6 pieces of Kabob look-alike Meat, rice you'd find in a Mexican taco shop with store bought pita bread but decor like a fancy restaurant at the strip.

My experience here was fabulous - great service, very clean place, and excellent food. When I was in Vegas in December, my dad and I saw an ad in the yellow pages in our hotel for Habib's.  Being Persian and constantly craving Persian food, I asked my dad (who is from Iran) to go with me.\n\nWe came here for lunch, and ordered entirely too much food.  We started off with must o'khiar to dip the bread in, and it was fantastic.  I ate too much bread though, which is probably why I left here feeling so painfully full.  We also each got doogh (a yogurt drink) which is carbonated - again, probably contributed to the fullness.  He got kabobs of some sort (I can't remember what kind), while I ordered koresht fesenjan (chicken in a pomegranate and walnut sauce).  It was absolutely delicious, and I was sad that I was too full to finish it.  So I got the rest of it to go and gave it to my dad, since he was flying out that day and could eat some while at the airport.  The total bill was $48, which was quite expensive for lunch for two, but like I said, we ordered way too much food, considering it was lunchtime.  But the quality of the food was fantastic, and Habib came over and talked to us quite a bit and made sure everything was to our liking.  There were quite a few people that came in who you could tell were regulars - they were greeted like they were old friends.\n\nAlso check out the market section - they have a large variety of food (some of which we have trouble finding in Florida), so we spent some money in there as well :)", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 3, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "I have been to Habib's a couple of times and like the place.\n\nThe kebabs are up to snuff.  One basic place everyone will want to start out at when tasting Persian cuisine is the Koobideh.  If you're Persian you will know right away whether the rest of the menu items will be good and if a follow on visit is needed.  If you are American (and are meat eater like me) it's a safe dish to go with.  I can tell you the Koobideh at Habib's is very good.  The Basmati rice served at this place is also perfect.  \n\nDon't forget the Maast-o Khiar either.  It's another standard to tell you not only how they prepare the food, but also how they hold the items prepared for the day.  A good Maast-o Khiar like the one served at Habib's is always a pleasure.\n\nThe Ghormeh Sabzi served was also good.  I would have preferred some lamb in the stew as well.  But a vegetarian Ghormeh Sabzi is always delicious stew.  For you dyed in the wool American out give this dish a chance.  It may look super dark green like overcooked spinach, but the flavor is definitely tasty and nothing like spinach.   \n\nFor those reading this review I am not Persian.  But I did fall in love with the food and now cook a wide range of Persian meals often at home.  Habib is not a strictly Persian place as evidenced by having hummus on the menu.  Some of the dishes are a little Americanized to bridge the gap.  But I would say this a decent place to start your love affair with Persian cooking.\n\nThough it's not on the menu you should ask for a serving of Tadig to go along with the stews.  This portion of the basmati rice preparation is a great compliment to the stew. \n\nAs it's been mentioned Habib's interior does have a few failing points.

Thanks to Yelp and other Yelpers I am trying all these new places now. Amena is by far one of the best I have tried yet. My sister and I came here after a day at the Korean Spa. We had sweated out all the alcohol from the night before and came here for healthy food. \n\nThe restaurant is set up so that you order at the counter and then they bring the food out to your table. As we were looking over the menu, the owner came out and offered us a sample of their dolmades. These are probably one of the best I have ever had. The leaves are tender and the rice filling gave it a nice contrasting texture. Served at room temperature, it was hard not ordering some. We ended up getting the vegetarian plate ($9.99) which consisted of hummus, babaganoush, 4 falafels, tabbouleh, potatoes, Greek yogurt, and a salad. After the last encounter with tabbouleh, I never expected to eat it ever again. The previous restaurant made it entirely out of parsley and had me thinking I was eating grass. Not at Amena, theirs was a good mix of cucumbers, tomatoes, wheat, mint, parsley, and lemon juice. The babaganoush was magnificent. Light and no one flavor was over powering. Like an ensemble cast, there was not one star, they all gave stand out performances. Like everyone mentioned, the falafels and pita are noteworthy. Moving on to the next plate, the Combo ($13.99) had beef and chicken shawarma, hummus, falafels, potatoes, and a salad. Ripping pieces of the pita and using my hands was my only thought. Utensils only slow down the eating process. Squirt some tahini and homemade hot sauce for perfection. Good thing they place a bottle of each on the table. I could not get enough of anything. Before we knew it, both plates were empty and all the pita was gone. \n\nIt is crucial to save room for desserts. Being a bakery, we wanted a cheese stuffed dough dish tossed in a honey sauce, but they were out. Instead, the owner recommended the cheese kanafeh. When it came, we were in awe. My sister guessed that it was phyllo dough, I thought it was vermicelli noodles. Looking it up, we were both right in a way. It is phyllo dough shredded up to vermicelli like strands that has a light spread of cheese, browned in butter, soaked in a simple syrup, and covered with crushed pistachios. \n\nI had got a Turkish coffee as well. This was my least favorite item. It was too loose. I am used to it being thick foam and almost sludge like near the end. I also appreciate it when it is sweetened for me. I ended up not getting any sugar added to mine because usually it is sweet enough, but not this time.\n\nWith the friendliness of the staff and the quality of food, I can't wait to go back.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 5, "cool": 4}}, {"text": "As much as I love it, I was scared from Mediterranean food after a previously bad experience. My brother, though at another time and place, was in the same position as myself - mine regarding falafel, his over tabbouleh. But we braved it to Amena after a time to the Korean spa to regain both hope and nourishment. Amena threw out of my inhibitions - evident through the empty places and pleas for dessert that soon followed.\n\nMy brother and I ordered based off our usual technique: divide and conquer. This meant ordering both the vegetarian plate ($9.99) and the Combo plate ($13.99). Soon after ordering at the counter, our food was brought out, and the Mediterranean bloodbath shortly followed. The vegetarian plate soon became both of our favorites - with hummus, babaganoush, falafel, potatoes, a savory Greek yogurt, salad, and tabbouleh. The babaganoush was so fresh and undiluted in its eggplant essence. The falafel was fresh out of the fryer, and absolutely blew my mind in its simplicity - who knew chickpeas could taste so good? The yogurt was literally thrown on everything, and made everything that was delicious infinitely better.\n\nThe Combo plate included beef and chicken shawarma, more hummus, falafel, potatos and another salad. The meat was really good, but honestly, we were more enamored with the veggie plate as we're not big meat eaters (also, we're suckers for babaganoush). Regardless, we finished off two plates within ten minutes or so. But I didn't even mention the pita! Fluffy, freshly baked, and housemade? My brother and I devoured the pita just as fast as we devoured the plates of food in front of us - rip, rip, meat! Rip, rip, falafel! Though we were offered more, our waistlines could not handle the carb overload.\n\nThen there was dessert. Initially, we had wanted to order fried dough stuffed with cheese topped with honey. But somethings are just not meant to be - evident through my inability to pronounce the dish and the fact they ran out of the dough. The proprietors then suggested the kanafeh with cheese (around $7 for a small) as an alternative. Neither of us had a clue what I just got ourselves into, but a few minutes later, I ate my way out of oblivion. Reading my brother's review, the kanafeh is comprised of phyllo dough so thin it resembles vermicelli noodles. Throw that onto of cheese and drizzle honey and pistachios on top - that's a kanafeh. Seeing as we devoured two combination plates and pita upon pita, we failed to finish the kanafeh (much to our waistline's dismay). But it was the perfect marriage of savory to sweet, crunchy to melty. \n\nTo be honest, the food was only have of the experience. The service was above and beyond graciousness. Within two minutes of entering the restaurant, both of us were offered free dolmades - the grape leaves tender and fresh with the lightest rice filling I've ever had. The owners were always so sweet - always asking the two of us if we were doing alright, how the food was, constantly offering more pita. Suggesting this dish or that dish, their upselling would normally be off-putting, but when the food is as delicious as Amena's or the people as nice as they were, I don't mind one bit.\n\nFor months, I had bookmarked Amena. It was only until every other establishment as an option fell through that I was finally able to cross it off. Luckily enough, the gods were in our favor that day.

First time I tried a falafel plate with an order of lentil soup and was actually quite disappointed in most of the items I had with the exception of the falafel which I found to be a very tasty version.   The lentil soup tasted medicinal to me and in all brutal honesty was the worst version I've had and for $4.95 I quite simply have no desire to ever order it again, though I would definitely give it another go if it came as a side to something else I ordered, but I don't see that as an option on their menu.  This is a little frustrating for me because I love ordering lentil soup from EVERY Mediterranean restaurant I go to and don't really want to spend $20 each time to do it.  AND IT'S ALL ABOUT ME.  \n\nThis time I decided to flip the script and go with the combo plate which came with several of the aforementioned delicious falafel, a healthy serving of hummus, some Beef and Chicken Shawarma, a side salad, and one piece of pita for $13.99.   Frustration point #2.  REALLY?  One piece of Pita?  With the huge amount of hummus they provided with the combo plate I really expected several.   For a comparison of my favorite Mediterranean choice, Hedary's provides 3-4 pieces of Pita for each and every lunch special ordered (and a choice of soup or salad to boot!)    Mmmmm, hedary's lentil soup.....  Okay sorry, back on track.   For what it's worth, that one piece of Pita was fantastic.  Fluffy, delicious, and perfect when dipped into the hummus (which I found to be a good version) or when used as a pocket for stuffing falafel and/or beef/chicken in it.  I REALLY could have used a few more, particularly for $13.99.   The beef and chicken shawarma had a really nice flavor from whatever marinade they are soaked in, though the meat did seem a little dry/overcooked.  The side salad was neglected by me like a red-headed stepchild which is the norm and nothing against Amena.  \n\nLastly I also ordered some of the homemade lemonade which I just saw Nelson mention is blended with mint.   I actually would have liked something to mention this fact on either the menu board or when I ordered it because I think I would have much preferred it plain.   It was decent even with it, but I'm not a big mint in drink guy.  \n\nOn pure taste of the food I had today, I'd give it 4 stars as the Pita, Falafel, Hummus and Shawarma all hit the spot.

(top of Leith Walk, across from the Playhouse &Cinema!)\nGood opening hours? Check! (open until 3am!)\nPretty Middle Eastern decor? Check! (Colourful glass lanterns galore!)\nDelicious food? Check! (my stuffed vine leaves were fabulous, and the falafel   shawarma wrap was a tasty, good sized portion)\nNew discoveries? Check! (Pomegranate Ice Cream, creamy, smooth, delicate YUM!)\nBYOB? Check! (and no corkage charge either!)\nExcellent value? Check! (3 courses, including a tip worked out at \u00a320 per person!)\nGood service?....hmmm!\nGreat atmosphere?....erm!\n\nMy checklist grinds to a halt at this point!\n\nDon't get me wrong, it was a nice enough place to come and eat, and I think it'd be a perfect weeknight / late night place to grab a bite to eat, but given we were on a birthday night out, it just didn't feel we were looked after enough to make it special.\n\nI've been in many other BYOB restaurants where you're given ice buckets, and the waiting staff have still poured out your glasses of wine (and kept them topped up!), but here we were just left to fend for ourselves. I suppose we could have asked for ice buckets, and probably would have been given them...but that's not the point!\n\nAfter sitting down we seemed to wait an age before we were given menus and our order was taken, although the food actually came quite quickly once we had ordered. After another long wait, we had to ask to see the dessert menu as they didn't seem too fussed about giving it to us. Further request for water to be topped up and the bill followed.\n\nIt certainly didn't have the same, lovely atmosphere that Hanams manages to achieve, but it was good food at a very reasonable price, and I'll certainly be back for more of that delicious Pomegranate ice cream.

A bit disappointed given my fabulous experience in its sister restaurant, Hanams. \n\nThe menu is a lot smaller than Hanams' - basically made up of a number of hot and cold meat and vegetable meze and then a much smaller number of mains. This wasn't an issue in itself as my family and I went for a late Saturday lunch and didn't necessarily want anything too heavy but it might be an issue for dinner customers who don't like sharing. \n\nFor 3 of us we opted for a set price 6 mezes for 2 people (you can pick what you want but only 2 meat) and 1 lamb main as it sounded lovely and we felt greedy. All in all the mezes were ok. Tasty, and to be fair we did eat everything, but not up to the same high standards as its sister restaurant. The waiter highly recommended the marinated chicken wings as an alternative to a lamb and rice parcel i picked but they didn't have but these were pretty forgettable and a bit 'plain' really.  The much anticipated marinated slices of lamb and rice (i asked for pomegranate rice) basically turned out to be 'bits' of dry lamb on plain rice with a spicy sauce to dip. No pomegranate rice to be seen and never once through our entire meal did anyone ask how we were enjoying our food even though they were not busy. \n\nWe'd taken 3 bottles of wine between the 3 of us (yes, my family are jakeys) so of course wanted to nurse the wine and finish every last drop before we left. This wasn't a problem at all to the staff and we never once felt rushed which i liked. There was a table of very tipsy elderly women next to us that had the same idea!!  \n\nAfter a digestive gap, we considered dessert. Now I'm not generally a dessert person but I do have a weakness for cupcakes, and with a selection of yummy varieties to choose from such as rose, walnut and pomegranate I felt it would be rude not to get one! My mum and brother opted for the baklava and the saffron ice cream which they shared. I opted for the rose cupcake which came with a small portion of rose ice cream (a weird combination but when in Rome!). The baklava was a crispy, honeyed hit and the saffron ice cream smooth and creamy, however my cupcake was stale and had the texture of bread! The waiter insisted they were freshly delivered but upon checking the batch, agreed the problem seemed to be with all the rose ones. I was given a pomegranate one instead which was ok but not great. I know good cupcake and this wasn't it! \n\nThe location is ideal and the decor lovely. At night the candles and bright lanterns look amazing. The place is fine if you want a really casual sharing meal experience, with some byob wine or beers and you don't have high expectations.

I also made sure we asked for an ice bucket, as per Susan M.'s warning, so there was no issue there. But the important thing for me about Middle Eastern cuisine, is that it feels so much fresher than other places, and a perfect place to go on a humid, stormy night, and I wanted to try somewhere new, so threw myself into Pomegranate.\n\nFoodwise, we enjoyed everything - the only slight bumnotes were the tabbouleh - crazy levels of parsley even by tabbouleh standards, but flavour was a little lacking, and the sundried tomato and ginger tapenade - not so gingery as vinegary. But! a seriously delightful baba ghanoush, easy on the sesame, made up for everything. Naan bread, just so very moreish.\n\nFor me, the halloumi was fabulous, slow roasted aubergine a hit with all 3 of us, the solitary meat dish (lamb samosas... as I can't spell soubbassek-thingy) a hit as well. Lovely falafel, although the hummus was forgettable. Sadly we were too full to try the pomegranate ice cream, hopefully another time.\n\nDecor wise it is bright, and the restaurant was heaving, even for a Tuesday.

The two ways that Middle Eastern, Thai, Indian, etc. food can be spoiled in my humble opinion are by over cooking the food until the vegetables are a ghost of their former selves or by adding too much oil to where you can't feel your lips anymore and need plenty of napkins. I experienced none of that here and the flavors were exceptional. Even the vegetable samosas came out very tasty without being overly oily and everything I had just hit the spot.

They proclaim proudly about a 72 hour marinade process and a custom made kebob grill thats supposed to be the bees knees.\n\nWith whatever you order you get a choice of different sides, amongst a salad bar, which although tiny had a nice assortment of add-ons, like chick peas, afghani pico, roasted red peppers, chutneys, and conventional stuff you'd expect as well.\n\nYummy times on the Lamb Kebobs! The skewer was removed from the meat, so although it looks small it still packs quite a punch (twhs) and was quite a filling meal. Tasty, lean lamby goodness, with a firm and satisfying mouthfeel!  The chutney was pretty tart, I liked it a lot, although I disagree with a previous comment about the spiciness. The little cup of pico de gallo Afghani style (haha I'm sure theres an actual name but too lazy to look it up) was tasty. Also I'm sure misnamed but the Tahini sauce was thinner then a greek one and more herbacious, quite delicious.

Their naan bread they used for the wrap is thicker and almost wheatier then anything I've had before, kinda neutral on it but worked as an acceptable conveyance of the deliciousness inside.\n\nHas only been opened two weeks so will continue to explore what they offer, pretty wide assortment of items on their menu, with some vegetarian entrees for those so inclined.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 6, "useful": 6, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Being extra generous but its a 3 for food quality at best but the owner was very quick to respond when they left items off my order.

Very traditional in appearance and strong spice smells.This was not the case. The Higely Shopping Center is newly developed next to the new Banner Hospital. The restaurant is pretty spacious; 8 booths (I think) and about 6 tables. The Expo window let's you view the kitchen while serving yourself with a delightful salad or Pepsi product. The decor was colorful and lively, but still showed tradition with a modern flair. The young female servers were friendly and helpful, so much so that they ordered almost all my order. Which I was wanting because I didn't know what to expect being a novice to Middle Eastern\\Afghani food. I placed me  to go order for my boyfriend and I,  which took about 10 minutes,  I think to complete. The spread include:  \n\n- Vegetable Samosas: fried potato turnover with onion and peas. Delicious!\n\n- Beef Mantu: beef steamed dumplings covered in a red and cream sauce. They were like raviolis with spicy marinara. Good, not sure I order again. \n\n- Roasted Red Pepper Hummus: fresh and yummy. A little atypical as it was chunky; not smooth like most hummus.\n\n- Chicken Kabob with spinach rice and Naan: Rice was scrumptious, chicken was tender and juicy, but I felt it needed more in flavor. Naan, well I will get to this later. \n\n- Beef Sirlion Kabob with spinach rice and salad bar: Like the chicken it was missing the mark in flavor for me, but the green spicy sauce, taziki and Mediterranean Pico added to it. The salad bar had mixed greens that you could add Kalamata olives, grilled mixed veggies, garbanzo beans, etc. Quite an array of fixings and dressings. All fresh and cold. \n\nNow most of important the Naan! I don't know if they have one of those fancy flat tops or steamer things, but the bread was crisp and fluffy. The burnt edges were lil' smoky bites of goodness. The slight drizzle of olive oil added a sweetness that made me want gobble it. Did I add they served up a plentiful amount and thank goodness they did as it was amazing with hummus or just alone. \n\nWill I go back?  Heck yes, Groupon or not. \n\nTip on the Groupon: \nMake sure you read fine print; any smart person does! You cannot use it with other coupons or specials and there are two offers are available.

I was browsing Yelp one morning, checking my bookmarks, and reading reviews just to find someplace new that caught my eye, and Rania's certainly did that.  What a fantastic first impression!\n\nWe were greeted right away and guided to a booth, and our server, Margaret, took our drink order and said she'd give us time to look at the menu.  I had already been scoping it out on the internet and drooling over the choices, so we started with 2 of the Beef Mantu and 2 of the Ashak on the small plate menu.  I love that they have different amounts for these so you can get as many as you want.  With a salad and some bread you could make a meal out of the small plates alone.\n\nI wish I could describe the flavors in a way that would really do both of these dishes justice, but they were amazing and a blend that I had never tasted before.  The mantu in particular had a little heat to the seasoning blend, but nothing overwhelming at all.  It was very pleasant and I want to go back and eat those again for sure.  \n\nThen for our entrees I ordered the chicken breast and beef sirloin kabob platter with brown rice and the naan bread.  Mr. M ordered the pan fried fish with spinach rice and the salad bar.  \n\nThe salad bar choices are really varied and nice and fresh.  Mr. M came back with some greens, chickpeas, olives, and I think some raisins were in there, but it was a nice way to start the meal.  The bread is great too, and I agree with other reviewers who say it's a little different from what you might expect.  A few charred edges and a thinly fluffy interior make this bread different and very tasty.  I loved scooping some rice and grilled meat from my plate onto some bread and tasting that group of flavors.  Wow.  Just wow.\n\nMr. M's fish was fried perfectly as well.  Nice light breading and nice light texture all around.  Again, a blend of seasonings that I'm too inexperienced to describe, but it was delicious.

Maybe I'm spoiled by Copper Kettle and their fantastically fresh garlic naan from the tandoor. This naan is thicker, which is fine, but they don't seem to use fresh garlic.

Eastern Ave.  Along the way I looked around for cool places to check out, when the traffic has stopped at traffic lights and it was safe to do of course, for things to do and kind of planning my lunch for the day.\n\nSo my first stop was this tiny Asian market that also serves breakfast and boba drinks (it is just next door) and it didn't look too appealing to me.  So I walked next door to Kabob Grill, and reminiscing about the handful of great Persian restaurants I have been referred to try or been taken to in California.  The menu looks simple enough, and they have the basic kabob varieties you expect from a decent Persian restaurant, not to mention one that specializes in kabobs.  And they even have the ground beef kabob (Kabaabe Koobideh) that I prefer over most other items on the menu.  Lunch is already off to a good start!\n\nSo after debating if I should get their lunch special or just ordering the same Ground Beef in the Main Dishes section, I went with the Large Main Dishes version of Ground Beef (which is served with rice, onions, pita bread, butter and optional grilled tomato and two skewers of ground beef) at $9.99.  The lunch special version comes with just 1 skewer of meat (except the \"Soltani\" items, which serves two combinations of skewer meats), rice, salad, onions, pita bread and fountain drink with price ranging from $8.49 to $13.49. In general the Main Dishes items are a $1 more than their equivalent in the lunch specials.\n\nI didn't bother to take pictures of the exterior or interior, thinking that other Yelpers surely have reviewed this place already.  So no photos, except the food I ordered.  But I will say that their display case is beautifully stocked with various canned and bottled beverages and some homemade pastries. The menu and the paint scheme on the wall matches, and utilizes the vibrant green, yellow and white colors.  The d\u00e9cor is simple, with black marbled-top tables and matching black cushion chairs arranged around the average size dining area of the restaurant.\n\nAnyway, service is okay. It is just another \"step up to the counter and order your food, wait for it to be prepared and pick it up at the counter when your number is called\" kind of fast casual food service operation. They greet you when you walk in, but not when you have finished your meal and walking out the door.\n\nFood-wise, it looks good. And if you can drool and imagine just how wonderful it tastes just looking at pictures, then they would get 4-5 stars for \"food styling\".  But based on just trying one item out of the 13 they have available in their Main DIshes section of the menu, I would say this is a 3 stars (A-OK) at best.  My ground beef kabob was juicy (always a plus), but flavor and seasoning-wise it was just okay. Just like a McDonald's burger is okay, but not potentially awesome like the much more expensive gourmet burger from Burger Bar, and you are not paying all that much.\n\nBUT I was disappointed that they did not served the \"optional\" grilled tomato, which is clearly shown in the sample photos for the items. I am not sure if you have to specify you want the \"optional\" grilled tomato, or they simply just don't have it (not likely, since they served sliced tomatoes in the salads I see others ordering) or forgot to put it on my plate.  And I have to say the juiciness and sweetness of the tomato really adds to the flavor profile of the dish, and helps cut the feeling of fattiness mouthfeel after consuming some of the kabob.\n\nValue for the money -  2 stars compared to most restaurants in the fast casual category.  But Persian foods have always cost a little more at restaurants, so I guess 3 stars compared to other Persian kabob fast casual restaurants.\n\nInteresting stuff (at least I think it is) - Kabob Burgers. Kabobs served with the onions, sliced tomato and a lettuce stuffed between burger buns.\n\nThey also have an interesting Appetizers and Salad menus. Babaganoush looks good in the picture.  And I want to try their inexpensive but still interesting Shirazy Salad (chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, parsley topped with lemon juice and olive oil for $3.99).\n \nThis is my first Yelp review of a Persian \"restaurant\" in Las Vegas, so I will give it a 3 stars. Par for the course to compare others to, otherwise it would be a 2 stars for not going above and beyond the bare minimal in service, food preparation and omitting item (I want that grilled tomato gosh darn it!) that should come with the food you order.\n\nPromotions (any day after 5pm): \n* Buy 2 Main Dishes and Get 1 Free\n* 10% off any purchase of $50 & up \n\nHours 11am - 8pm\nPhone Number: (702)43KABOB or 435-2262\n\nSame plaza as Pin Kaow 3 and Red Mango (on S.

I love that it provides a delivery option in my area that isn't pizza or chinese/thai, though I have mad love for both of those options.   Respect due to pizza hut.   Anyway, the thought of hot and fresh gyro meat and falafel balls being delivered to my doorstep as I sit on my bed unshowered watching reruns of No Reservations sends me into euphoria.  \n\nOn this day I had a $5 off coupon emailed to me from Eat24Hours which made it all even more appealing, and I ordered some falafel appetizers, a gyro salad, and chicken soltani, which consists of a chicken kabob along with a piece of kabob koobideh, which is a skewered minced meat kabob, all on top of a heaping of basmati rice.  Delivery was estimated to happen between 45 and 60 minutes, and I was happy when a delivery driver from Kabob Grill rang my doorbell 30 minutes later.  The first item I tried was the falafel.   I found it to be a nice version of one of my favorite foods, though texture-wise it was a little different than I'm used to as I could still make out little pieces of chopped up carrots within the fried outer shell.  It wasn't off-putting in the least, but I do slightly prefer a uniform texture throughout that I'm used to.  Next I tried the Gyro Salad, and while the gyro meat was plentiful and tasty, I was a little disappointed that there was no feta cheese.  Now I must say the menu doesn't mention feta so there shouldn't be any expectation of feta from me in that sense... no, I take it back, I WANT FETA!   The veggies seemed fresh and crisp and overall I was pleased otherwise.   Lastly to the Chicken Soltani.  The pieces of chicken skewer were large, moist and flavorful, which is about all you can ask for from chicken in my opinion.   The koobideh kabob also had a great flavor to it, and I enjoyed stuffing a piece of pita with rice and one meat or the other and some veggies.   This actually brings me to my biggest disappointment of the entire order (feta notwithstanding).   There were only 2 pieces of pita provided with this meal!  I don't mean two large pieces either, I'm talking two small triangles that would normally last 20 seconds in any given mediterranean restaurant I might dine in.  Instead I found myself rationing them out like I was stranded on a desert island.  Maybe I'm used to being spoiled with Pita from Hedary's, but  I felt like there should be some extra considering the amount of food ordered.\n\nWhen it's all said and done, I can highly recommend Kabob Grill to satisfy your delivery (and probably take out/dine-in) cravings, though you might want to have some feta in the fridge and order an extra side of pitas to make yours a 5 star experience.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I do not recommend.

Upon arrival the waitress was outside and greeted us with a friendly hello. As we entered the restaurant I couldn't help but take in all the decor...the Tiffany inspired chandlers, the paintings on the wall (which turned out to be wall paper), the pillars, the long tables, and the dance floor with a stage that was set up to play bands. There was only one group of dinners in the restaurant and there wasn't any music playing, which was a little unsettling. But we decided to go forth and see what the experience could bring us!\n\nThe menu was quit detailed, so if it was your first time eating Lebanese food, you'd know what you would be getting into. It all looked so good to me! We ended up ordering some hummus, tabbouleh, a shawarma sandwich and a chicken taouk sandwich. We decided that we would share everything! The hummus was so tasty, just like it should be. So creamy and smooth with a buttery taste. The tabbouleh was amazing with the finely minced parsley, diced tomatoes, onions, cracked wheat, mint, extra virgin olive oil, and lemon juice! Very yummy...I could eat it every day! The shawarma sandwich was good. This sandwich is usually marinated in yogurt and spices over night, although, I'm not sure what this places uses as the marinade. It did come with tahini sauce, garlic, lemon juice, seasoned onions, sliced tomato and pickles. The chicken taouk sandwich wasn't as good but I think that's because of the garlic sauce they put in it. If you dare to eat this sandwich, make sure you don't have to be up-close and personal with someone! The chicken was char-grilled served with garlic sauce, tomatoes and pickles. Both sandwiches came with french fries, which I thought was a little odd. I would have preferred a small side of hummus or babganoush instead.\n\nOver all, we stuffed ourselves and had leftovers! I will go back when the craving for hummus is calling! But I would wait till later in the day for when the band and belly dancers show up!

There's probably not much in between.\n\nAs for me, my husband and I attended a friend's birthday party here on a Saturday night. As other reviews have mentioned this place gets poppin' on the weekends. My husband and I arrived as the first of the anyone in the party to get there. We were seated at one of the many long tables. That's a thing with Ali Baba, it does seem as though they tend to serve large groups, not small dining parties. I wonder if this is because of a tradition in Lebanese culture? I'm not sure.\n\nAnyway, the place is dimly lit, with a disco ball spinning in one corner above the dance floor and musician's stage. There is a bar area toward the back. The whole of the restaurant is painted with Middle Eastern type scenes. \n\nOn Saturday night they have a band and a singer (yes, a real singer) who sings VERY loudly and everyone cheers and claps and some people sing along. Well, the only way you can sing along is if you know what language he is singing in! People get up and dance all through the night and through their dinners. The singer roams the dining area enticing people to sing and clap with him. it's like a Mexican place that has a band/singers, but taken to the next level. \n\nBy the way, they do hookah here directly on the tables while food is being served. So, if that ain't in your ball park, go elsewhere or it's going to seriously ruin your dining experience if others in the restaurant are partaking of the option, which our party was. I thought it was deliciously naughty and fun to be able to smoke, eat, and drink all at the same time. ;)\n\nAs for the food and drinks, and this is honestly one of only two dings I had regarding our experience here. I find the pricing to be a little much. My husband ordered a Jack and Coke and it cost him $10 (plus tip). I mean yikes. That's crazy. Plus, the food is NOT cheap. You can get food such as this elsewhere at lower prices. \n\nWhat we had food-wise was appetizer plates split between our entire group. We got two orders of their Grand Mezza (which was actually too much for 10 people). It came with: Hommos, Tabbouleh, Baba Ghanouj, Labneh, Falafel, Kebbehballs, Mixed Pies (Cheese, Spinach, Meat), Fool Medamas, Sujok, Bastermaand Grape Leaves. I honestly cannot at this point in time remember what I actually ate, although I tried to get a bit of everything. I thought everything had great flavor and was tasty. The only thing I did not like was the Bastermaand Grape Leaves. Too much of a bitter flavor. I think I would have to go back and really sit down and know what I was eating to really give a good review on the food. But overall, for our party these dishes worked well.\n\nWe also ordered two bottles of Arak for the table. This is the national alcoholic drink of Lebanon and it is 100 proof liquor and it is not cheap. We all imbibed and we were all very merry. We danced and clapped and ate and smoked and danced some more and ate and drank some more.\n\nHonestly I loved partying here! I thought it was fun. The only issue I had was that it was just a tad too loud to hear much of what my party was saying. \n\nBesides the loudness and the high-prices Ali Baba was an awesome time.

We were absolutely the only people inside the restaurant, while what looked like the owner/manager and two friends were smoking hookah outside.  \n    After waiting about 3-4 minutes we were greeted at the table as we had come a few minutes behind our friends who had already ordered drinks.  The owner/manager I mentioned earlier was our waiter because he didn't seem to be wearing any kind of serving uniform.  \n     After we ordered our food about 10 minutes went by at which point a man who was clearly the cook (wearing apron) came up to us, hurriedly, to take our order.  We told him we had already ordered, and he asked who took the order and we pointed to the manager coming through the door with ingredients bought at a nearby market.  He ran up to him then they both ran back to the kitchen together. OK so they ran out of ingredients, and clearly the cook had no idea anyone was inside the restaurant or had ordered for those first 10 minutes.  \n     About 20 minutes later we got our food, which was OK, definitely not anything great.  The chicken shawarma looked like it had been thrown together rather quickly and not really fully cooked (probably because they were trying to rush after having to go to the market to get ingredients).  \n     I had a beer but my wife had ordered a Mojito.

After a flavor consensus and suggestion from the waitress we order A (1) hookah. After we finally got the thing going (hookah wasn't pulling well) there is hardly any flavor and within 5-10 minutes of us smoking (and it's not like we're hitting the thing hard, we spent most of the time talking)- the smoke is incredibly harsh and even my hardened-cigarette smoking Marine buddy is coughing up a storm.

We love Mediterranean food and the ratings looked promising so we decided to try Khoury's. Could it have been written in the stars that Khourys was only .5 miles away from the Vegas house?! Perhaps! \n\nA dimly lit restaurant where you can see the wood fire oven as soon as you walk in and feel the warmth emanating from it upon entering the establishment. The music was middle eastern sounding, and the familiar aromas of Lebanese cuisine pranced around my senses. We sat and looked at the menu that was rather full of variety. \n\nThe salads were enticing, but when I saw the pizza choices I became curious as the descriptions were beginning to win me over. The BF wanted a Gyro, and suggested we share two meals. It was a great idea and I decide to order the veggie pizza, which came with feta and kalamata olives and TONS of veggies. We ordered the hummus to start. They brought us seasoned olive oil, FRESH pita bread that was DIVINE and some INCREDIBLE hummus. It was RICH and creamy, you could taste the tanginess of the lemon, the olive oil and the parsley. I LOVE the pickled beets they use to adorn the hummus. Absolutely fantastic. The pita was grainy, soft and fresh. It tasted amazing in BOTH of the hummus and oil. I couldn't decide which I liked better so I kept switching. \n\nOur food came out and the pizza smelled even better than it sounded on the menu. The vegetables were cooked to perfection. Not to crunchy or firm and not soggy and overcooked. It was bell peppers, squash, mushrooms, tomatoes, feta, kalamata olives and tomato sauce. The crust was awesome. Thin and soft. I was VERY impressed. I loved the feta cheese and kalamata olives on the pizza. It was different and the bold flavors always strike my palate. \n\nThe gyro was awesome. It was sort of \"pressed\" instead of in a soft pita, so the outside was crispier. Definitely a texture we appreciated. The gyro meat was flavorful and complimented the flavors of the cucumber on the tzatziki. The fries were softer, they tasted EXACTLY like potatoes. Weren't over seasoned and appeared to be BAKED instead of fried. \n\nOverall this place was lovely.

The rice they served with it was fine, but they went and raw onion on the plate that kind of overwhelmed whatever you tried to eat it with.  Also, their \"grilled\" veggies that they served with it were pretty much raw, not appealing.  I would say that the biggest issue I had there was with their pita, it was overcooked, period.  Even the fresh pita I got midway through my meal was crunchy on the bottom!  Pita should NEVER be crunchy!  Also, it still had flour or something on the outside of it that was kind of grainy and not particularly appealing.  I was also somewhat annoyed to find out that I got charged for the side of pickled veggies that I asked for without being told that first by the server.

My friend ordered the Kafta, a ground sirloin sausage, which they grill and serve on a bed of rice. The starch was cooked perfectly and possessed so much flavor. The Kafta was good, but not moan inducing. I ordered the Lamb Swarma and it got illicit in the dining room. The noises were almost pornographic, at least in my head. The meat was tender, not gamy, and packed with complex flavor. Served with a side of rice and tahini, it was good with their warm bread. For $3.95 each, we added a Khoury's and a Greek Salad. The namesake greens was a simple lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumber number, but the dressing packed a tart punch. The lemony bite is what I crave in a salad. Forget using all that oil, just give me a pucker inducing dressing. The Greek was just as good. It had a similar base as the first salad but with feta, olives, and the classic vinaigrette. \n\nAdd a couple glasses of red wine and we were chatting up a storm while enjoying the atmosphere. Around dinner time, it got busy quick. With one hostess and one waitress, they handled the crowd well.

I've heard good things about the food and they said there were certain things they order that is quite nice there so we decided to give it a go. \n\nWe decided to do the dinner for two. Its' $39.99 and you get a choice of a soup or sald each, a shared appetizer, a entree each, and a dessert each. It seemed to be the way to go for dinner, since the prices are more during dinner than lunch...but it seems the portions look to be the same in pics? I don't get why places do that. \n\nLentil Soup - pretty good actually. Lighter type broth and had some spinach and the squeeze of lemon made it quite good. \nGreek Salad - pretty plentiful and the components were fresh. A bit overdressed, but still good. \nOur friends got other kinds of soup, chicken and a beef and rice one. \n\nFor appetizer we got- \nBaba ganoush - pretty solid, a bit smoky and nice texture. I like that there was a bit of pink pickles, I wish we ordered a plate of pickles. \nHummus - our friends got this and it was decent flavor and consistency, but the baba ganoush was the winner. \n\nThey handmake their own puffy pita which is a plus, and ask for refills. They give some olive oil with zaatar. \n\nBeef kebob - it was just OK. It could use more flavoring and was rather small pieces to be charging what they do. On pictures, it seemed that kebobs were much plumper back then. \nMoussaka - it was a vegetarian one, and wasn't like a traditional stacked style but more a stuffed eggplant with chickpeas and tomato sauce. It's their own take that reminds me of Lebanese stuffed eggplant. It was good for vegan version, but disappointing that I was expecting it to be something else. The thing that was crappy is our friend LOVES their moussaka here and always ordered it - when it had meat in it. He was so disappointed he sent it back because it was not really something he was aware changed. I don't get why they would get rid of a classic. I know they got requests for more vegetarian options, but that sucks for everyone else. Could be in addition to, not instead of. Stuffing a eggplant with meat mix vs the chickpeas isn't too difficult. Please, don't let vegans ruin a good thing. \n\nWe got the baklava to go. It was a plentiful serving of 4 little rolls each which was nice. It was pretty decent and oddly we got two different batches of one crispy and one not as crispy and we all had different opinions which we preferred. \n\nService was odd. She was nice in a kinda awkward way of trying to make chit chat, but was definitely struggling to serve 3 tables with basics. We ordered fries and hoped for bread ASAP since there was a slightly cranky baby with us too. Our bread was sitting on the pas for a while so it was more crunchy than fluffy when we got the first batch. Boo. It was also a wait for the bill even though it was clear mom and baby were gone, my BF was getting fresh air and we needed.\n\nFor having spent $100 for dinner for 4, we expected far better. It seems my friends who are regulars even seem to be a bit upset and don't want to be back when that particular lady is working (they seem to only get bad service with her) and hope that the moussaka will be back. I live far enough that I'm not sure if I will make the effort to come back, specially since DW is next door.

Then finally a nice woman in a black shirt asked if we were helped and handed us a menu. After looking through the menu my cousin finally decided on what she wanted. So the woman in the black shirt took us to the cashier area to take our order. While she was taking our order, the lady in the white shirt (she wore glasses , on the hefty side, and have glasses) was so rude and didn't even say excuse me and told her to stop checking us out because she 'doesn't like for her customers to wait for a check'... In my head I was like what are we?? And then she was rude and pushed that girl to the side after she voided our order and the woman in black told her \"she's ordering\" and the lady in the white shirt was so rude and talked down to her and us and said \"well she doesn't care. I think she doesn't care!

While his son in law is still trying to remember what each item costs, he's amicable enough.   His wife, Wadi's daughter was equally as earnest in her enthusiasm for her father's food and in the success of their newly opened restaurant.\n\nWe wish them well because...the food was terrific.  Standouts were the dishes that you can't find everywhere in town.  The fool -- a soup or side dish - made of favas or broad beans - is chock full of garlic, lemon, cumin and olive oil - with hummus, green onions and perfect tahini - it knocked our socks off.

His falafel were crisp tender, hot out of the fryer delicious.  \n\nMy only real complaint - and it's not really a complaint, just a personal preference, is that I'm not a huge fan of large chunks of raw onion -- I'd prefer them had he had a more delicate hand and soaked them in ice to tame them a bit, and his tomatoes were crappy - (but then it's January and all tomatoes are crappy)... but this isn't enough to keep me away, nor should it you.  \n\nI also loved that all his dishes had a large generous hunks of lemon. \nThe gyro was basic.

The dips were addicting. Awaiting my friend's move in Goldfish, I'd find myself mindlessly snacking on more. Oh, but the falafel. After twenty minutes or so, five falafel disks atop a salad came out. Halfway through, my fix was quickly satisfied. Crisp, piping hot, and so flavorful. Egyptian style? I couldn't tell you. I was too enamored with them to notice.\n\nSo why the low rating? Two reasons in particular: the terrible feeling I had after the meal and a price discrepancy. I was still at the table when a surge of nausea and stomach pain hit me. I blamed it on the hummus, but after eating leftovers of my entree the next day, I immediately knew it was the falafel. When my friend gave her leftovers to her boyfriend, who has a stomach of steel, he couldn't bear the aftermath of the fried chickpea madness. Next, we were charged for the hummus and pita that we specifically mentioned we didn't order. I wasn't about to argue extensively over it considering our two falafel plates ($6 each) and the hummus/baba ganoush ($4) came out to $18 after tax. \n\nAn hour after leaving, I was truly upset.

Hire more staff if it takes more than 10 minutes to get a cup of coffee on a table\n2.  Turn the damn music down\n3.  Make a one drink minimum for people who aren't dropping $25 on average sheesha\n4.

Wait, what's that? It's $20 just because it's a Saturday night? Now you're pushing it. Well, at least I can split the cost with my friends. Four people to a hookah will be alright, I suppose.

Like seriously, no sodas?? Just expensive bottled water and smoothies. So we get the smoothies. There's no smoking inside or on the 2nd floor (even though one guy did manage to get them to let him up there, I have no idea how though) so we were seated outside where we had to wait 15-20 minutes for the hookah and then another 10 minutes just for our drinks.

We get there and they were a bit busier than last time, so much so that we believe the guy that we need to wait 15 minutes for a table because all of the tables and couches inside and out were packed. But we started getting pissed when a group that came in after us got a table so my boyfriend goes over to ask the guy and he just tells us that he's waiting for us to get rid of our outside drinks.

We met up to help kick-off a special occasion.\n\nFor starters, we had this interesting blend of hummus and sauteed eggplant accompanied by these soft flour tortilla-like bread used for dipping.  \n\nFor the entree, I ordered this basic meat dish called the Naderi Sultani which consist of chicken tenders on skewers, marinated filet mignon, and Koobideh (ground beef that had been prepared like a sausage link without the clear casing).  All of that came with a generous pile of non-sticky, very long grain rice that I personally have never seen before.  Due to it's soft and light texture, forking into it was effortless.  The flavor was slightly enhanced by this buttery, oily drizzle.  This particular dish is easily 2 persons serving!\n\nWhile I managed to finish half of my dish, I had to sample some of my friends' entrees, the specially, seasoned baked chicken and stewed lamb shank.  Both were really tender and flavorful and had that pulled from the bone goodness.  A key note to take in is that most, if not all, of the dishes come with some kind of rice, preparation may vary from dish to dish.\n\nDessert was not an option after all of that meat and rice!  If I ever make my way back, I would definitely order less.  A good suggestion is to order 1 plate less the number of people in your party.  Depending on the dish, the proportion can be a bit overwhelming, some is 2, 1.5, or 1 person serving.\n\nOur server was attentive to our needs and kindly clarified on our questionable dishes.

One could even describe it as a place where Aladdin and Princess Jasmine would dine at.\n\nOverall, if you like steak and potatoes, your going to like Arabic meat and rice.

I guess I should have known from the location, but this place is very posh. I'm not usually a fan of restaurants like this, but I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nNow, let me start off by saying that I wasn't very ecstatic about visiting this place simply due to the fact that I knew it'd be pricey. My good friend ended up paying for the dinner, so I was definitely a little bit less critical. If you have a special occasion, and need persian food, then this is the place to go. The atmosphere is great and very high-end. The food is great, but the pricing...we'll get to that later.\n\nService is excellent as you would expect for such a great atmosphere. Like I said, this is a very high-end persian restaurant. The staff is friendly, and the waiters are very attentive. I really don't remember one bad thing about the staff at all. 5-star experience here.\n\nFood is excellent as well. My two friends and I shared a kabob platter that came with chicken, beef, and lamb kabobs. They were all very perfectly cooked and extremely tender and juicy. We got burberry rice to go along with it, and while at first it was delicious, I think it just came with too much rice. They make their own naan, or whatever Persians call their bread. To me, this is worthy enough for a visit. There are very few places in Phoenix that make their own naan, especially Arab/Greek/Med places.\n\nDessert? Yeah, again, I was skeptical about the pistachio ice cream, but my friend ended up ordering it anyways (he's a regular at this place). Again, WOW. The ice cream was served in chilled cups, and it was just amazing. You could tell it was homemade ice cream, and the pistachio flavoring was just sublime. If you come here for a special occasion, and you have a significant other, you will score well if you order the ice cream. The texture of the ice cream was just perfect.\n\nSo why did I give this place a 4-star? I feel that if my friend paid $80 for food for the three of us that he should have taken a significant portion home. He took the leftover rice, and maybe 3 bites of kabobs. The pricing would be great if you got a little bit more food. Of course, you can argue quality over quantity, but I doubt they'd be losing money if they threw just a little bit more meat into their $45 meat sampler/platter. If you want to try something new for your significant other, or a special party or something then come here. Don't be upset though if your wallet is hurting afterwards.\n\nI'm really torn about this place, and I want to give this place a 5-star (the food totally deserves it), but I just don't think I can ever go back, unless Obama gives me a stimulus package for my hunger.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Excellent food, love the Onion and hot bread with butter they bring out, i usually dip it in hummus...usually i order the Barg Which is really tender filet Mignon- this plate alone can feed 2 people..nice decor and great service.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Poor service - slow, error prone and had to be reminded repeatedly.

I couldn't have been happier with my experience at Persian Room. The service, the food, the wine selection, the ambiance, everything was pretty much perfect.\n\nAnd it's a good thing too, because my first visit was to take my mom out for her birthday. She loves Middle Eastern food and is gluten intolerant, so the meat and/or veggie kabobs and rice-focused menu was perfect for her (and my vegetarian sister who was also with us). It is really hard to find a restaurant that appeals to people with varying dietary needs/choices and this one suited us perfectly.\n\nI had first heard about the restaurant when it was briefly profiled on PBS. The food sounded fantastic and the space looked gorgeous! More on the traditional-fancy side, it offers a grand staircase in the middle of the room that goes up to the bar area. The first floor has a few booths and several tables (which were almost all taken at 6p on a Sunday, with large families and older couples). \n\nOur stellar service started when we were asked if we wanted a table or a booth. So simple, but a great gesture to ensure your clients are most comfortable. Our server was excellent about offering suggestions and explaining items when I told her I was pretty unfamiliar with the food on their menu. She offered the info that their (enormous) entrees are very flexible - if one comes with two chicken kabobs, you can ask for one chicken and one koobideh, and you can halve your side of rice (it's huge) and fill that in with a Greek salad. Fantastic, though it meant we took another 10 minutes putting together our order. \n\nI ended up with the koobideh kabob (ground beef mixed with garlic and onion and spices) and the polo rice, it was great. Mom got the filet kabob (replacing 1 of the 2 with a chicken kabob) and traded out the regular basmati rice with a specialty rice that included raisins and dates. Sister went veggie kabob and a side of the same specialty rice. None of us had a single complaint. Pita bread was fresh and delicious, cucumber/yogurt dip was tart and refreshing.\n\nWe had given our mom her bday card at the table, and when the server came by to clear our plates, she asked if it was a bday celebration and offered their Persian ice cream (vanilla ice cream with rose water, pistachios and honey). Seriously, was she great or what? We said of course and baklava for sister and I to share also. The ice cream came out with a candle and syrup \"Happy Birthday\" and our baklava came out sliced in half for us. I know, it's small stuff but it all added up and just impressed us again and again. (You better try that Persian ice cream if you go, it is incredible).\n\nOne last awesome move on the server's part - when she saw us dividing up the leftover pita in out to-go boxes, she offered more of their \"good bread\" (that they don't start serving until later in the evening) that was fresh out of the oven. She brought us out a stack of it wrapped and ready to go.\n\nI repeat: Wow.\n\np.s. I have to admit I immediately get on the offense when I go to a restaurant that doesn't have an entr\u00e9e below $13 on the menu. I get very \"who do they think they are?\" Then I'm like a hawk for all they ways they fall short of their price-prohibitive ways. And this place blew me away, worth every penny by way of portion sizes, service, quality and atmosphere.  To give you an idea (I always like knowing costs of stuff before I commit - champagne taste, champagne of beers budget, you see), we ordered a bottle of wine, an appetizer dip, a small Greek salad, three entrees and one dessert, and the total was just over $100.\n\np.p.s.

I could've sworn I'd written a review, albeit a year or two *after* my very first visit with Mom and her ex- back when I still lived in Chandler ('04), or perhaps even before that, in Maricopa (horrors!).  I remembered that he, a carnivore at heart, had the #31 Sultani,  while Mom and I shared the # 19 Chicken shish.  We also shared a hummus app.  I vividly recall thinking Persian Room's pita bread stupefying, and I'm happy to report it still is!\n\nIt was a hard decision to make- what to have for dinner, after seeing \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\" last night (go see it!!), but I decided I'd wait until I could treat Mom out for sushi and to go to PR, instead.  I tried to stop by for takeout on Valentine's Day, but my last minute decision, made after a public speaking class and a whirlwind two-hour writing session at the college library, was foiled when I encountered a packed parking lot, so I headed home instead.  It was easy to find parking tonight, and it was nice to see takeout menus waiting by the first set of glass doors (there are two), where I could comfortably read the menu before going through the second set of doors and place my order at the cashier/host desk.  The friendly female host took my order of Kashk O' Bademjan (app) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a2ZBDIXmwBm7IWnXR6LK-g?select=A8dp3ThElnflQAyEU6LNXQ#A8dp3ThElnflQAyEU6LNXQ and #33 Naderi (from the section of beef entrees) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/a2ZBDIXmwBm7IWnXR6LK-g?select=GJNTuFYve2kjaT5XqTDdCA#GJNTuFYve2kjaT5XqTDdCA.  Note that \"all entrees include basmati rice, pita bread, and a grilled tomato.\"  I asked how long the order would take to prepare (\"about ten minutes\") and proceeded up the stairs to the lounge to read my book as I wait.  Or so I thought...\n\nIt was my first time up at the lounge, and it's cozy enough.  There are many two-top tables up there, in case you don't want to sit in the larger rooms downstairs, and the bar is comfortable enough to dine solo, or with a friend or two.  There is a TV for those who MUST watch sports as you dine with your companion or unfortunate date... As I've said, I was only going for takeout and was only up here to take advantage of the lighting, but silly me, I asked if PR offered happy hour, and sure enough, it does!  Monday to Friday, from 5p to 8p, happy hour discounts on beer and house wine ($4 glass instead of regular $6) AND a free app (hummus, hummus and eggplant, dolmeh, or yogurt and cucumber dip).  And so, I decided why not enjoy a glass of chard with the hummus I had passed on for dinner?  The pour was actually quite good, and tasty, and it paired nicely with the delicious sauce plate of hummus and a lone olive, topped with spices.  Hot pita bread followed shortly... I was blissful!  (Well, OK, I was very happy.  Yes, I was blissful, too, but that praise rightfully belongs to my lovely therapist at SWIHA!)\n\nThe takeout took a lot longer than ten minutes, but I wasn't going to argue, not when I was already full from my app and tipsy from the wine!\n\nI hope to return more often!\n\np.s.  I did get to try a few pieces of chicken and filet mignon (delicately marinated, yet flavorful, and so tender!), with saffron rice (so buttery!), and another large piece of pita bread to enjoy a bit of the eggplant app with.  The entree was delicious, yet I don't think it's worth $21.95 for take out (see photo).  I could see paying that while dining in, since I have to factor in service and atmosphere, but for takeout...?\n\nGhaza aali bood, merci!\n\np.p.s.

Of course we couldn't send it back and address the problem since the server failed to follow up.\n\nI ordered a martini straight up and it took over 45 minutes to receive it.

The food was great as usual and the salmon was to die for. So this concludes the good part of our visit. \nI worst part was the service. It was just plain awful from the same waitress that we always get stuck with when we visit (we come here often). Usually the service isn't terrible enough to warrant a bad review. But today was just special (in a bad way). This wasn't that cheap of an item off the menu and the restaurant wasn't too busy but I kid you not, we only saw the waitress twice; when we ordered and when she brought the food. Don't even get me started on her attitude. She may have missed the number 1 requirement taught at Waiting 101 which is smile. I would say I'll let it slide if it was the first time but she's always grouchy and today, extremely unfriendly. We finished our food and we waited about 10 minutes for her to come so we can ask for the check. Nope. She was chatting with the greeter and I tried my best to squeeze the last ounces of my patience, but to no success. So we just stood up, my wife went to the car with my son and I waited in line to pay for my expensive meal. Just terrific! HOW IN THE HECK IS A SERVICE LIKE THIS IS EXPECTED TO BE TOLERATED, especially on a WEEKEND? \n\nOf course she saw me waiting in line and she then came with the check. I said absolutely no word to her because if I have, it would have been unpleasant.\n\nOn a check that was around $60, I tipped her $3 and I still thought that was generous. I'm not even close to being cheap when it comes to tipping but this time I had to make a statement. \n\nTo sum up; Terrible service from the older waitress (40s). The greeter was excellent.

This is hands down some of the best Persian food I've had in a while (my favorite place is Hen House in Irvine, CA... but this place comes very close!)\n\nFirst of all, walking in through the glass double doors you feel like you're dining with royalty as the restaurant entry has a beautiful staircase and the walls and floors are decked with red and gold Persian tapestry, curtains and rugs. Love the vibe, it can be considered a nice place to bring the family or a date. But there were definitely many families there the night we went. Service was impeccable even thought it was busy, our waitress Nicole was very sweet and attentive! Now on to the food...\n\nMy friends were visiting from California and we had spent the whole day eating around Scottsdale and I had been forewarned about the large serving sizes so we knew to order little. Still, the three of us ended up ordering a Kashk O'Bademjan, Osh E'Reshteh, and a Beef and Chicken Koobideh a la carte... Wow, I'm actually drooling right now! The Kashk for those who don't know is like a roasted eggplant spread with whey and topped with fried onions. It typically has a little bit of yogurt in it to make it creamier (and in my opinion, tastier). The kashk here didn't have much yogurt, if any so it had a more concentrated eggplant flavor. I actually think it tasted more like curried eggplant, but regardless it was delicious! The Ash was also delicious, very hearty with all the vegetables and easy on the noodles (which I prefer). It was thick enough to put on our plate and eat with pita rather than eat it as a soup. The koobideh was BOMB, I prefer the ground meat to steak because its easier to eat and absorbs a lot more flavor, but it really depends on my mood. But both the chicken and beef were flavorful and moist. We quickly ran out of pita bread so decided to order a side of rice (haha we really should just have ordered an entree) and it was a huge serving! We had to order another koobideh just so we could take it home as leftovers mmm..The meal came with a plate of basil, cilantro and raw onion as well. I love to tear up the raw basil and mix it in with my rice and top it all off with the sumac they leave on every table. Overall, I thought the food was excellent :D\n\nPrices were perfect for the amount of food you get! For 3 people and 2 alc. drinks, Osh, Kashk Obadmejan, 3 koobideh, a side of rice and a side of Tahini bill came out to 52 bucks.

We came from all over the valley, from Goodyear, from Chandler, etc.  How excited we were.  We all had heard such wonderful comments about the restaurant.  We went on an Saturday night, reservations at 6. Assumingly, their busiest night, so they should have been well prepared.  What a horrendous experience we had.  It started off well.  But we noticed right away the service was slow.  When I was finally able to flag someone down to take my drink order, I was informed they could not make a mojito as they did not have any mine.  No mint?  A middle eastern restaurant without mint? They tried to push their signature drink on me, but I was not interested.  I had already been informed the drink was overly sweet.  Fine, I just stuck with water.  Another attendee ordered a Pear Martini that she had to send back as it tasted like cough syrup.  She ended up with one of their signature drinks.  Dinners were ordered.  For $17.00 I received a large plate with 3/4 of it rice and what looked like one skewer of chicken.  Looking around, the plates of the other attendees looks pretty much the same, a small portion of meat and 3/4 of rice.  The entire time we were there [approx. 3 hours] not once were our water glasses refilled.   Not once did the waitress come over and asked how everything was, did we need anything.  Not once.  After dinner, the dinner plates took an extremely long time to be removed and not all the plates were removed.  Two of the woman ordered the Persian Pastry, only to be informed by the waitress they were all out of it.  Did the woman want something else?  One woman ordered baklava and the other ordered another item off the menu.  What she received was not what she ordered on the menu, but instead another item was brought out, having been told once again, the second dessert she ordered was not available either.  Two of us women decided to order an after dinner coffee, with a shot of Kahlua and whipped cream. They were brought out iced, and in a whiskey glass.  What?  I informed the waiter I wanted hot coffee.  Got my hot coffee, luke warm, and again in a whiskey glass.  Really?  I wanted a cup of coffee, and I get it in a whiskey glass?  Another woman at the table just wanted a cup of regular coffee and it took the waitress over 15 minutes to bring her the coffee.  What, did they have to pick and grind the beans?.  Meanwhile, dirty dinner plates remained on the table.  Finally, we all had enough.  Once of the woman took charge after the waitress was bringing by the checks.  She wanted to speak with the manager.  During the 1/2 hour, many discussions took place, whereas the manager was very condescending. [Makes you wonder if that is how he speaks with his customers in general, or just us because we were woman]. They were understaffed that night.  It's a Saturday night.  It is the restaurant's responsibility to make sure they are staff and the customers are attended to.  He offered to give a $30 dollar gift card for us to come back.  Come back?  That was laughable.  We are never coming back and cannot wait to tell our experience to our friends.  The manager then comes over with the two desserts that were initially ordered?  Where were these the first time around?  Oh, the waitress did not know that they did in fact have the desserts.  Would we like them know? No!  What we want is our check and some compensation for our horrible experience.  \"We could box up the desserts and you can take them home\".  \nWhat part of no did he not understand.  After much insistence he did comp some of each of our checks, but the full gratuity was left on.  No way.  We were not leaving a full tip.

The Persian Room really impressed me when I went with a group for the April ISCUYE. This place has a really cool atmosphere and a ton of exotic looking d\u00e9cor. There was so much to look at. It was a just the right balance of classy and homey. I think they really put an effort into incorporating some culture without making it cheesy.\n\nI had read plenty of the reviews before hand so I had to order the Eggplant hummus. It was every bit as good as my fellow Yelpers claimed. The eggplant was not a strong flavor so the hubby was willing to eat it. If anything I think it just gave it a nice smooth texture. Anyway, it was really, really good. I also wanted to try the cucumber salad which was exactly what is described in the menu: unpeeled cucumbers, diced tomatoes and a simple lemon and olive oil dressing. This was excellent as well... just the type of salad I would make at home. All the reviewers mentioned that the meal portions are huge and they were not kidding. But I wanted to get a salad anyway because I noticed none of the entrees are served with any vegetables. They are all just the meat with A TON of rice. So, basically what I would recommend is order the hummus or other dip as an appetizer, a salad, and one entr\u00e9e and then that is the perfect amount of food for two people or maybe even 3 people.\n\nUnfortunately hubby did not want to share so he ordered #31 Sultani. This is a combination of the filet mignon kabob (Barg) and the ground beef kabob (Koobideh). The Barg was absolutely amazing. An extremely tender and flavorful cut of beef! I didn't try the Koobideh but he said it was pretty good too. I ordered the #36 Lamb Shanks and it was delicious as well. I was too full already by that point to eat much of it but I did really enjoy the meat. The shank is usually the toughest part but this was braised so perfectly that it was fall-of-the-bone tender. They gave me two bones and they were both huge! I suspect that it was actually mutton, lol! But it was seriously very tender and delicious. The rice it came with had fava beans and some other spices in it but to be honest I found that it tasted bland and pretty much the same as everyone else's rice. I think they should really serve less of it since no one at the table finished their rice.\n\nOverall a great experience. The service was also fantastic.

The chicken was moist dark meat that differed from other shawarma I tasted because it was more almost nutty tasting and less of that tang taste that some shawarma has. The portion was monstrous as I ate a bunch my husband ate some and I took over 4 oz home. Maybe they just wanted to use up that batch and let it all go on me? I don't know? The eggplant was tasty and tasted like you fried onions with eggplant in a pan. The carrots were skillfully chopped into the tiniest cubes and seemed to taste a bit like coriander but weren't spicy but flavorful. I liked the spicy sauce that came with the plate it wasn't too spicy but was very flavorful and it was long and lingering and interesting.\n\nBoth of us were blown away with the beef kabob. It tasted better than we were expecting so it was a pleasant surprise. It tasted like the juiciest better tasting burger you can imagine. A thin nice sear and very moist lightly packed beef that was very good. My husband said if we ever go back he will try a hamburger from here. The kabob plate came with two sides and my husband picked fries and salad. The Fries were COLD AND SOGGY and might have been leftovers from the large take out order before us. The salad was finely diced tomatoes and cucumbers that they call Israeli Salad but according to Wikipedia Arabs also call this salad Arab Salad and Palestinians call this salad Palestinian Salad so it seems the Mid East is also fighting for bragging rights over this salad.\n\nOur waiter offered us some pita bread with tehini. I have to say time froze and stopped  still for a second when we tasted the pita. It was that good, I don't know how you make a simple pita taste that good but it was. It was fresh warm very light but strong in texture. My husband isn't really crazy about any shawarma from anywhere but even he said the chicken on this pita was delicious.\n\nI took home my left over chicken home and a few sauces and ordered a few felafel's to go. They are green inside and that is an indication of a better felafel that is made with fresh herbs instead of dry. The felafel's didn't have a big crunch but were moist inside and very fresh herby tasting. \n\nOur waiter was very thoughtful and just kept trying to bring me more food.\n\nSome big hits but the fries were a miss.

The schwarma is cooked on a traditional vertical skewer and made from dark meat chicken.   They serve it in a lafa (kind of like burrito style) or pita.  I prefer lafa, since you can get all the ingredients in each bite, whereas in a pita, the ingredients are layered on top of each other, so may get 1 bite of just eggplant or something.  My favorite toppings: Schwarma in a lafa with roasted eggplant, hummus, tahini, israeli salad, and charif (spicy sauce).  \n\nUnfortunately, they seem to run out of schwarma frequently.  Because of that, I have tried a few other dishes, all of which have been good but not as good as schwarma.
