The manager agreed that our group of 20 could use their buy one, get one entree free coupons (2 only of us had them with us), but he left and his assistant manager wouldn't honor them, because--get this--we are one big table of 20 people.  Nowhere on the coupon does it say one coupon per table either.  We weren't asking for everyone to get a discount (like I said, only 2 of us had them, anyway).  We all agreed that we should of each sat at different tables in the restaurant if it made that big of a deal.  What a B.S. excuse.  Yeah, that made us delightfully happy...not. \nWe actually were almost arguing with the poor young girl who was our waitress about it, and she was only doing what the assistant manager--who conveniently hid from us--told her to do.

Either this assistant manager has no clue about coupons, could care less about repeat business or is just the puppet for the powers-that-be behind the throne, but we surely were not treated well.\n\nBUT here is the best part of the entire bill paying event:  One of us paid with a $20 bill for a $9.40 meal, and she waited for her change--only to receive $10 back!

No.  But for fast food, it is a four star option.\n\nHowever, when I compare it to other greek-style places, it falls short in a few ways:\n\n1) The condiments.  For starters, you do not get any.  Between myself and my husband, we could probably go through a gallon of tzatiki sauce in one meal.  He likes to drench his fries in it, I like to dress my salad with it...but all you get (per gyro) is one itty bitty sad little cup.  And if you want feta cheese?  Jalapenos? Olives? A side of ANYTHING?  You must pay.  It makes one feel a bit nickeled and dimed (although the condiments cost much more than a single nickel or dime or nickel and dime combined).  It even cost $.50 to add cucumber to your gyro.  That can buy an entire cucumber at the grocery store!\n\n2) The french fries.  They are not bad fries per say, but they are bland.  They need some salt, or some garlic seasoning, or something.  I will add - they are not soggy and that is something I appreciate.  I hate soggy fries!!!  The other downside is that they are a small serving.  As a female, I often try to avoid greasy food to help counterbalance my ice cream intake, and instead I like to eat them off my husband's plate. Because if they come from my husband's plate, then they do not count as part of my meal. Right?  But this is hard to do when my husband is protecting a small reserve.\n\nAt the end of the day,when you add up all the condiments, a meal costs over $20.  And as I type this, my husband is in the kitchen eating chips out of the pantry, so the $20 did not even fill him up.\n\nBut was it tasty, yes.\nWe just needed more french fries and condiments.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}], "state": "AZ", "stars": 4.0, "latitude": 33.4948197}], "85268": [{"full_address": "16758 E Glenbrook Blvd\nFountain Hills, AZ 85268", "rest_id": "KAKyy-8lKrPEzvtZJM1PGQ", "categories": ["Greek", "Mediterranean"], "city": "Fountain Hills", "review_count": 0, "name": "Jimmy's Krazy Greek Restaurant", "longitude": -111.7184703, "reviews": [], "state": "AZ", "stars": 4.0, "latitude": 33.6246091}], "85013": [{"full_address": "5341 N 7th Ave\nPhoenix, AZ 85013", "rest_id": "dmyytmVobrPfPO6IrKbjuQ", "categories": ["Greek", "Italian"], "city": "Phoenix", "review_count": 0, "name": "Gretalian", "longitude": -112.0822543, "reviews": [], "state": "AZ", "stars": 3.5, "latitude": 33.5163421}], "53774": [{"full_address": "2524 University Ave\nRegent\nMadison, WI 53774", "rest_id": "D9H2EYJa9n7yDU013SVgvg", "categories": ["Greek", "Vegetarian", "Mediterranean", "Middle Eastern", "Moroccan"], "city": "Madison", "review_count": 0, "name": "Lulu's Deli and Restaurant", "longitude": -89.42972, "reviews": [], "state": "WI", "stars": 3.5, "latitude": 43.072576}, {"full_address": "410 E Wilson St\nCapitol\nMadison, WI 53774", "rest_id": "9GUN0cEAK6ysOz0oGhCK8A", "categories": ["Greek", "Breakfast & Brunch"], "city": "Madison", "review_count": 0, "name": "Plaka Taverna", "longitude": -89.377173, "reviews": [], "state": "WI", "stars": 4.0, "latitude": 43.075599}], "85015": [{"full_address": "4041 N 15th Ave\nPhoenix, AZ 85015", "rest_id": "0dIChGWBs9ueUXl0hhkw2w", "categories": ["Greek", "Mediterranean", "Sandwiches"], "city": "Phoenix", "review_count": 0, "name": "Crazy Jim's", "longitude": -112.0910715, "reviews": [], "state": "AZ", "stars": 4.0, "latitude": 33.4943622}], "85014": [{"full_address": "1588 E Bethany Home Rd\nPhoenix, AZ 85014", "rest_id": "FltN1Hnw4n7BORXJH1kaeg", "categories": ["Greek", "Mediterranean", "Middle Eastern"], "city": "Phoenix", "review_count": 0, "name": "Mediterranean House", "longitude": -112.0479298, "reviews": [], "state": "AZ", "stars": 4.0, "latitude": 33.5237171}, {"full_address": "830 E Indian School Rd\nPhoenix, AZ 85014", "rest_id": "eX_f1ZzrpejCp6xJpfLmDQ", "categories": ["Greek", "Mediterranean", "Middle Eastern"], "city": "Phoenix", "review_count": 0, "name": "Athens Bar & Grill", "longitude": -112.0632727, "reviews": [], "state": "AZ", "stars": 4.0, "latitude": 33.4947482}], "85260": [{"full_address": "15090 N Northsight Blvd\nScottsdale, AZ 85260", "rest_id": "DjVWQ_Idtw6X5Eg0W5JFWg", "categories": ["Greek", "Mediterranean"], "city": "Scottsdale", "review_count": 0, "name": "Greek Gyros", "longitude": -111.89655, "reviews": [], "state": "AZ", "stars": 4.0, "latitude": 33.6234324}, {"full_address": "9301 Shea Blvd\nScottsdale, AZ 85260", "hygiene": 1, "rest_id": "8i5hB_dmf33NVbWE5SwoMQ", "categories": ["Greek"], "city": "Scottsdale", "review_count": 44, "name": "Taste of Greek", "longitude": -111.879768909896, "reviews": [{"text": "I'm always looking for a great casual bite near Scottsdale Healthcare on Shea.

(Since I try to avoid chicken and lamb due to food allergies, steak and chick peas are the only proteins I'd be considering, anyway.)  Since steak was not an option tonight, I went for a la carte items of chicken pita ($7.95), regular hummus ($4.50 or $4.95), and a couple of falafel balls ($1 for two pieces).\n\nSurprisingly, it took longer than I expected to prepare the falafel balls and pita wrap, which I took as a good sign that they were cooked-to-order.  The hummus was the only one that was pre-prepared, and it came with ONE olive.  A rather tasty olive at that, and it was a pity that it was all by its lonesome, since the bite that included it was the only time I thought the hummus was worthwhile... Still, I've kept the container in the fridge, as it still is a protein source.  (However, now that I think about it, if it's not organic, then really, I'm not doing my body any favors- SAY NO TO GMO!)\n\nThe falafel balls were piping-hot and tasty, albeit a tad too salty.  Again, I'm going to assume the chick peas weren't organic and the soybean oil used to fry it wasn't either, so this may be the last time I ever speak of them...  The first few bites of the pita wrap didn't win me over UNTIL I remembered to add the tzatziki sauce I'd requested to be on the side (cuke allergy).

The french fries are thick and are not too soft or too crunchy.\n\nUltimate Shawarma - the bread seems buttered with the right amount of crunch when you bite into it.  The steak, with the onions, tomato, and provolone combined make for a definite party in your mouth.  Tasty and savory sandwich.  This is a definite after party or late night treat!\n\nService:  They are family owned and do an excellent job of service.

For us, it was too feta-cheesey strong, with a chilli kick, but overall we didn't like the flavour a whole lot. From other reviews, I think some stock has been taken as it was delivered, semi soft, and on a plate rather than in a ramekin. It was served with pita bread... but I have to admit, that I was disappointed in - rustic bread, as it was advertised, conjours up some lovely crusty loaf, not toasted dry pita. So, not overly won on the first course, but putting it down to wrong menu choice rather than bad food. \n\nNext up - the souvlaki and the swordfish. The souvlaki contained about an udders worth of halloumi - more than I think it is possible to consume - very salty halloumi as well - I found myself trying to bury the salt with the chips... or anything to combat the saltiness. Personally, I would have liked about half the halloumi and more veg - it felt very unbalanced. The chips, I also felt, were too oily and soggy, but I couldn't decide if that was down to the kebabs lying on top of the chips, or if there had been more oil drizzled on top. The salad was also oily (and tasty), which with the combination of the souvlaki (oily) and chips (oily) gave me an overdose of oil and by the end, it was too much for me. That healthy goodness that I had wanted from my meal was lost. \n\nSo, do I think what I had was good? Well, it was nice, and cooked well, but not inspiring to me. Flavours didn't overwhelm me. The silent reviewer noted that the swordfish, marinated in black pepper and paprika didn't carry over any of the flavour, and overall felt his dish was rather bland. I enjoyed my house rose, but at the end of the main course, opted to go home rather than stay for dessert. I liked the idea of My Big Fat Greek Kitchen, but I was sadly underwhelmed by the results - too bad, as they are nice!

In fact, I think My Big Fat Greek Kitchen might be the only one. They obviously have a sense of humour, with the name, and whilst it might not look too grandiose on the outside, the food is as good as any other Greek restaurant I've tried.\n\nAs you'd expect with a Greek restaurant, the staff were very friendly (the owner) and is half-Greek himself. THe restaurant is quite small and perhaps lacks a really strong ambience, but the one it has is a muted relaxed, quiet one. I guess I would hope for lower lighting, candles, darker taverna style walls, and some plate smashing occasionally? But that's like expecting every Scottish pub to serve only whisky and for the staff to wear kilts...\n\nThe menu is as you'd expect. Lots of mezze options, and we went for three dips and pitta. If I'm going to be fussy, the starter options were really quite small. Not much dip at all. But the mains are big enough to feed two so it all balances itself out. I actually had to take half my lamb kebab away in a wee box.\n\nThey do state that they serve all mains with chips, which I find a little odd, but I asked for mine with rice and it wasn't a problem.\n\nThe lamb was charcoaly, grilled, meaty goodness.

Again and again.....Boring! Since MY involvement though I've been shaking things up a bit in choosing different local venues. All recommended by my trusty yelp app! This month was Greek! \n\nI've rated it a 3 overall and this is based on an experience of a quick, set menu lunch option for a group of 10. My expectations probably would be higher should i choose to come here again for dinner.\n\nThe owner and his wife were very friendly and accommodating of my email request for a pre-order of food so i could keep the time as speedy as possible. Great service! He came over with his iPad to check off the menu choices against each name to ensure everyone got what they ordered and kept an eye on the time for us. The food arrived promptly, at the same time and with no mistakes. No problemo!\n\nLike Jenny I thought the chips option as standard was weird for a Greek restaurant but I followed her tip and asked for a rice option at the time of emailing the pre order. The food was OK. Not great but fine for a quick lunch. I actually liked not feeling far too stuffed and sleepy as we tend to be after these lunches. Satisfied but not too full! \n\nThe small set menu consisted of 2 courses for \u00a39.95. Not a lot of options to choose from but that's expected for a set lunch menu. They only had a veggie moussaka option on it. Grump! I wanted the lamb one! In the end I chose the dolmades to start (which I normally love) but being honest there was something I didn't quite like about the texture of the overly mushy rice filling inside. Maybe overcooked rice? I ate them though. The chicken kebab (or souvlaki) was lovely, really tasty and grilled well. The warm pitta they put on the table to share was a nice touch. Something to dip it in would have been good. Like hummus! \n\nI had to return my white wine because it was corked. I brought it to the owners attention quietly as i was expecting a bit of denial, but to be fair, he took one sniff, agreed, apologised and changed all the white wine on the table.

Coworker 2 had a chicken skewer platter with rice, salad and pita bread. He said his food tasted excellent.

This seemed to carry into the restaurant a little bit too. Despite this problem, we proceeded to order and try out the place.\n\nI ordered up the Vegetarian combo that comes with a greek salad, hummus, tiropita (cheese pie), falalfel and pita bread. My girlfriend ordered a chicken plate that came with thinly sliced chicken pieces, \"greek\" fries, rice and a salad. \n\nMy meal was pretty decent, everything was just \"ok\". Nothing extraordinary or outstanding. My girlfriend didn't like the greek salad dressing, claiming that it tasted too \"olivey\". She also didn't like the rice, which was pretty plain and didn't taste like lemon whatsoever. The \"greek\" fries didn't seem very greek at all. They appeared to be non-house made fresh fries with a bit of seasoning on them. She said the chicken was OK.\n\nMid-way through our meal, the Greek music CD that they were playing in the restaurant started skipping. Now we all know how annoying a skipping CD is. It's basically an ear-wrenching, headache inducing nightmare. Not a big problem if they would've fixed it right away, but they let this POS audio-bomb go for at least 10 minutes before fixing it.

We were extremely disappointed. One of those rare occasions I forgot my cell phone or I could have posted pictures to explain why. I ordered a vegetarian plate with hummus, baba & falafel. The hummus was form fitted to the section in the plate just like jello pudding cups, was this plated in the morning for my 7:30 pm visit? Not what I expect when they post a sign on the counter that they don't have specials because they don't use (have?) leftovers. Really wish I'd had my phone to take a picture.\nBaba was not as form fitted, but both were covered in a clear oil, if it even was olive it had no olive taste or color so either low quality or not even olive. I have had better hummus buying pre-packaged at the grocery stores. Baba did not impress either, sad that I have made it once at home from an online recipe & my guests loved that, this one taste was enough. I will continue to drive on to Stephano's when craving some baba.\nI love falafel, to the extreme that when I go to Parsley Mediterranean Grill, as soon as I walk in they ask me how many orders of falafel I want that day. Here, when I called before going to see if they were gluten-free, I was told they are made from a mix which is gluten free - garbanzo, fava & corn oil. But judging from the shape & texture - these were like balls of bean flavored cake - almost like cupcake consistency. Were they baked or fried? There wasn't oil on the plate under them & they soaked up the tahini that was squirted on them. Baked would be healthier, but these just didn't cut it for me. I ate  1/2 of one & it came with 4. Yes, I left hungry having eaten less than 2 full bites of a $10 plate.\nHis kebab plate which he ordered the chicken charred wasn't even showing a speck of char on the second trip from the grill (yes we know it's unhealthy charred but it's how he likes it & ordered it). The Greek salad on the plate was drenched in oil so it was flavorless because as I've said, the oil has no color or taste. Probably why there is so much paprika spread on the top, guess not just for presentation but if any taste is desired, mix it in.\nMaybe they were in a rush to get out since it was about closing time, but for $30 with the above, an order of their garlic feta fries & a can of soda , if eating off plastic plates & utensils the food should be good. \nThis kind of reminds me of food in a mall's food court, not a stand alone restaurant\nFood was 1 star, service would have been 3 but couldn't get his char on, cleanliness is what brought them up to 2 stars. \nStill trying to figure out all those 5-star reviews. I use yelp all the time to find great new places, but this time I feel really let down.

Was a bit more expense than a Micky D's combo or Burger King combo which probably would have been about $20 to $25.\n\nMy wife liked the appetizer platter and loved the warmed pita bread.  I thought the falafel on the appetizer was overcooked, the dolmas is served cold, I like dolmas warm to hot. couldn't really differentiate the taste of hummus vs baba ghanouj, but I don't eat enough of it to really say.\n\nMy Gyro tasted good, they gave enough Tsatziki sauce to my satisfaction.\n\nOver all the food was average to good, we all enjoyed it, I would come back for quick Greek Food on the fly.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I love this place!

So, we opted for a 2.5 pound fish instead.  The fish was really amazing - grilled with some olive oil, lemon, pepper, and whatever else was on it.  The flavor was so delicate and light that you could still taste the flavor of the fish itself, which I find is not so common in America.  Americans seem to love their fish doused in butter and sauces that sometimes I can't tell if I'm eating fish or chicken.  But, this fish was so light and rich in flavor that my friends and I agreed it was worth getting again.

Estiatorio Milos is on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan and is a large space with balcony dining and what appears to be an actual in-house fish market that sells fresh Mediterranean fish to the public.  However, had we checked the Yelp reviews of the place prior to making our choice, we very likely would've chosen someplace else.  Thankfully, we didn't go elsewhere!\n\nMost of the negative reviews for Estiatorio Milos cited poor customer service as it major flaw with lack of received value compared to cost as another concern.  However, most, if not all, of the poor reviews were for their dinner service.  Estiatorio Milos does lunch very well!  EM offers a three-course prix fixe lunch for $20.11.  I'm assuming the price will go up to $20.12 next year.  I started with the Grilled Mediterranean Octopus served with fava.  This selection has a $10 supplementary charge, but it was worth it!  The sashimi-grade octopus' tentacle was broiled to perfection leaving it nicely smoky, but still moist and amazingly tender without a hint of rubberiness or toughess.  It was cut into medallions that ranged from half-dollar to quarter sized pieces.  A great start to the meal!  Next, I chose the Lavraki with horta.  Lavraki is a Mediterranean seabass more commonly known as branzino.  The lavraki was grilled whole then de-boned prior to serving. The fish possessed a delicate, but delicious flavor and was thankfully adorned only by capers, butter, a hint of salt, and flat-leaf parsley.  It was accompanied by horta, a saut\u00e9ed swiss chard and spinach dish seasoned with lemon, olive oil and sea salt.  A great entr\u00e9e!  For my dessert course, I had the Yogurt Martini.  It was lightly-sweetened Greek yogurt served in a martini glass.  It was the least memorable of the three courses.  I washed down my lunch with a glass of the Katsaros Chardonnay.  It wasn't overly oaky and possessed a nice clean finish.  It went very well with my lunch, but was a bit pricey in my mind at $16.  A team of servers provided our service.  They were friendly, attentive, and thorough throughout the meal.  One note:  EM was not crowded at all during our lunch visit.  Therefore, the server to diner ratio was definitely in their favor.  \n\nI can't speak to what EM brings to the table during their dinner service, but it definitely left a positive impression on my girlfriend and me for lunch.

We really lucked out and our Table Chef was Greek, so we were able to speak and order in Greek.  We made reservations and I am so glad we did, the place was PACKED.  Not an empty spot anywhere, not even at the bar and this was on a Wednesday night.  We soon found out why, the food is the best Greek food we have ever had.  Everything was perfect.  I know you are asking what did the Greek order... first let me tell you my HUGE error was that we never looked at the menu and we ordered as we would normally do in Greece.  I should have known by our Table Chefs face that this was going to hurt because he smiled broadly and went into overdrive action.  He just realized he had big spenders on his hands and he was going to make it happen... NOTE: ask for a menu before ordering, this restaurant is NOT for people with shallow pockets.   I was told if you have dinner later in the evening they have a prix fix menu that is only $50 and is 3 courses.   Well on to the food....\n\nWe started with shots of ouzo, hey as far as I was concerned we were in Greece.  Then we were served fried zucchini with a tsatsiki center, they were PERFECT, if you have ever tasted perfectly fried zucchini you will understand what I mean.  They weren't too starchy from the flour, they weren't soaked in oil, they crunched in your mouth and they had tons of flavor... I want them again RIGHT NOW.  \n\nThen came the fried calamari, one word YUM, again perfect.  When the octopus was served, we all smiled.  You could smell the char on it, and you could see that perfect white interior meat when it's cooked the way it should be.  Then I took a bite, OH YEAH, it just melts in your mouth and you taste fresh octopus, the char from the coals, the lemon and everything all at once.  This appetizer disappeared first.\n\nWe were then served a tomato salad with sliced red onion, cucumbers, capers, kalamata olives and feta cheese.  In Greece this is called the Horiatiki Salata.  I swore last night that they flew the damn tomatoes in from Greece.  When in Greece I practically live on salad because the veggies are so fantastic, and this tomato salad was spot on.  Big crunchy flavor filled bites of tomato.  The dressing was traditional olive oil and red wine vinegar.  The grilled bread they had brought to the table sort of fell into the salad bowl and I was a good hostess and fished it out and ate it.  Holy sh** it was such a satisfying bite.\n\nThen came our fish, we ordered Lavraki (European sea bass) in a salt crust, baked in the oven.  This takes a little longer than grilling, but we were in Greece and on Greek time.  The fish is brought table side and in Russian service style the Table Chef removed the salt crust and then skinned, filleted and served us.  I miss this tradition and it was amazing to watch him work with such showmanship and dexterity.  He served the fish with Horta (wild greens) and beets with their greens in the center.  THIS WAS DELICIOUS... The fish was so moist, tasty and flaky.  I wish I could cook fish like this, I would eat it more often.\n\nWe did not order dessert, we were bursting at the seams.  I look forward to coming here again, but this time I am looking at prices, as much as I loved LOVED my tomato salad, I believe that $27 for it is just a little to pricey.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Ya'll got any yeeroze? \n\nTL;DR - (too long, didn't read)\nStaff: 5\nFood: 4.5 \nValue: 3.5\n\nReview:\n\nIf you are looking for strip mall greek food you are going to want to GTFO of here as quick as possible as you will be really sad and really broke:) \n\nWe were greeted immediately by the hostes for our dinner (8:15pm on a Friday) and we were shown to our table. The minute our butts hit the table the sommelier was over with a wine list and asking our water preference. He then gave us a quick history and overview of the restaurant before leaving us for the time being. \n\nHe returned a few minutes later and We were undecided on what wine to get by the glass so he narrowed it dow to two choices and brought us samples. Yay for awesome service!\n\nI told the wifey that we had to order the Milos special which was a stack of thinly sliced and fried zucchini and eggplant with a few cheese cubes. \n\nOur waitress came over, asked if we had any questions and asked if we wanted to go fishing. Milos has the catches of the day on ice on display and the servers take you to the display and explain each fish and what to expect when ordering/eating them. Our server Toni walked us around and explained everything. She was very knowledgeable- akin to being at the SF fisherman's wharf without the throwing or yelling. So in essence nothing like being at the wharf. :)  \n\nSo we ended up ordering the Milos special, the small raw fish plate,  \nthe St. Pierre (Jon Dory) and the wife had the Mediterranean spiny lobster. \n\nSpecial: \n\n30 bucks and effing amazing. If your expecting the zucchini sticks you get at Red Robin, you should grab your Bud Light and leave:) \n\nOur sashimi plate was pretty good as well. I suppose it will draw comparisons to sushi places. Tuna, scallops and few others I cannot remember. The tuna had a bit of dill on it which is a greek thing but then again dill is not in my spice cabinet. \n\nDinner:\nJon Dory: 2lbs @ $46 each\nThis by far was the best piece of fish I have ever had. It was the whole fish, cut in half, cooked and seasoned to perfection. It was tender, moist  and most of all packed with flavor. It was AMAZING. \n\nSpiny lobster (Langouste)- 2.05lbs @90something a pound\n\nThe whole lobster arrives cut in half with the tail drenched in butter. My wife thought it was a bit under cooked but I actually think it was cooked perfectly. Considering the fella was alive 20 minutes ago it didn't need to be cooked to the normal level of steakhouse lobster tail.  I think it was perfect. She really enjoyed it except for some of the bits that were to her a touch under. So I got to eat them. YAY ME:) \n\nThe meat was sweet and tender. The presentation was great and my wife was doing the biology lesson on the fella. Kinda cool to see. \n\nOur wait staff, Toni and Hilary was amazing and if you get the chance to dine with them be sure to ask for them. \n\nSo our bill with tip for the 2 of us was just over 560 dollars. I told my wife that I could have flown her to SF, had the Chef's Plank at Lafitte and flown back for that kinda money. \n\nHer counter was two pairs of really hot shoes. :)\n\nEver again?

The only reason I gave it four was due to two issues that will be irrelevant to some people. First, the cheapest bottle of red wine was $70, which I think is ridiculous. I don't think it's asking too much to have a $50 bottle of wine on your menu. I like wine with food, but am not a connoisseur, so the difference between a $50 bottle and a $100 bottle is nil to me. Second, you're much better served going with a group of four or larger. Sides and appetizers state they serve two to four and they are huge and way too large for two people. You will also have far more seafood options if you are ordering for more than two people as the seafood bar (more to come later) selections are usually two pounds or more. \n\nOn to the food...amazing. Your server will take you to what is essentially a seafood market inside of the restaurant. There is a large bed of ice on which are laid their seafood selections for the evening. Each selection has a small sign which indicates the name of the selection and the price per pound. Most were in the $50/lb. range. We had originally ordered a Mediterranean Sea Bass, but it was only available at two lbs. or larger, so she recommended a similar selection that I can neither remember nor pronounce, at a pound and a half. Two lbs. would have been far too large for the two of us and we were not interested in leftovers. The seafood was so fresh and simply prepared. It was grilled, lightly seasoned and topped with a little oil. They let the seafood be the star and it is incredible. Our appetizer was the spreads, which included Tzatziki, Hummus, Tarmosalata and Fava. It was great, but it was so large we maybe ate a third of it at most as we didn't want to fill up on an appetizer. With the seafood we also ordered a side of their grilled peppers. Again, great, but a huge portion and over half of it was uneaten. Outstanding meal all the way around, but paid for a good amount of food we couldn't eat.

That being said, it's a discount menu and clearly I'm a fat idiot for complaining about one of my THREE courses being too small. It was very delicious and well prepared, just small.

Already we were impressed and we had only just arrived. \n\nAlthough Todd and the restaurant started getting busier and busier, he paid so much attention to us at our table, we felt incredibly special.

There are certain items where you have to pay extra eg lobster pasta ($15 more), grilled octopus ($10 more). But overall, this is a very good deal, especially if you want seafood that is not overcooked.\n\nI ordered their grilled octopus, grilled Mediterranean sea bass, and a yogurt martini. Very filling meal indeed. The grilled octopus had a light charcoal flavor mixed in with some sauteed onions. The tentacle pieces did not have a rubbery texture where I think I'm chewing on plastic. It might be a bland dish if you're the type to prefer bold flavors. But as an appetizer, it does its job for making you want more of their foods. It's not overwhelming since it's only the first course. Perfect size to share if you're dining with one or two other. \n\nMy sea bass was much more flavorful, just as I expected. A filet of sea bass grilled with lemon sauce. The ends of the fish can be a bit more tough from overcooking, but the inner parts were so soft, you can feel pieces of the fish as your tongue separates it layer by layer. The skin was grilled to a perfect crisp and soaks up the lemon sauce. If you took a bite with both the skin and the meat, you have like two sets of sensations going on in your mouth. I haven't had good seafood like this in a long while. The sauce was a bit too much for my broccoli on the side though, a bit too salty for my taste. \n\nMy dessert ended my meal with a grin. It is my first time trying Greek yogurt. I never knew what the hype is all about. It is very aromatic and filling. Although the dessert was served in a martini glass, the heavy yogurt will definitely fill in all the gaps. If you're the type to prefer a less sweet dessert, this will be a good choice.

I've heard about this 3 course $20.12 meal which used to be weekday. When I found out that they now serve it everyday until 2:30pm we headed straight over. \n\nI love the airy room and the terrace looks like a nice option to enjoy on a rare nice day. It was too hot so we stayed inside. \n\nThey start you off with grilled, crusty bread and some good olive oil.\n\nStarters : \n\nFresh Diver Scallop Skewer with green bell pepper, sweet onion & couscous- the skewer had some of the most fresh and sweet scallops I've had since moving to Vegas. It leads me to believe they weren't pre packaged , but fresh shucked as that's the only time I've had as superior of a scallop.   The preparation was very simple but it showed off the quality well. \n\nGrilled Mediterranean Octopus ($10 supplement) - this was worth the supplement. It was tender, the char was strong but was a nice flavor with the onions, caper and simple lemon, olive oil and sea salt. The BF normally doesn't like octopus because in his mind the texture is too rubbery but he enjoyed this. \n\nMain: \n\nWe both got the Lavraki/ grilled Mediterranean bass - It's a whole fish that just needed some of the lemon and that's it. They buttferfly it and debone except the collar and keep the head, skin on so keep in mind for people who only eat foods that don't resemble the animal they are. I happen to love that they chose to keep it  The flavor was a bit sweet, ocean-y in the right ways. It comes with a few broccoli stems and I thought I would need some sort of starch but I didn't. I had a bit of the bread left and that was enough and didn't take away from the fish. I even convinced my BF to try eating pieces of its face and eyes since it was fresh. Hah.  If you love sea bass like we do then this will make you very happy.  \n\nDessert: \n\nWalnut Pie with Kaimaki ice cream - With the description and even the look of the walnut cake I thought it was gonna be rich, warm and buttery and it was not. It took a whole unexpected crumbly texture and was served cold. The kaimaki isn't a ice cream I see often and it was nice to see a very Greek thing on the menu. Oddly, this is a refreshing dessert because of the texture and coolness and our other dessert that I thought was going to be light was the rich one.  \n\nYogurt Martini - this was rich and lovely. It is not like store Greek yogurt if that is what you are expecting but it's almost like a very soft cheese consistency. The berry syrup with it gave the right amount of tang. \n\nIt seems like the portions would make for a skimpy meal, but we were happily full.\n\nThe service was good, courteous, attentive and unobtrusive the way a high end restaurant should be. From our app to main there was a bit of a wait so maybe our fish went to someone else, but they definitely checked on us, apologized for the wait, brought us out more bread and got it to us cooked perfectly. I do not mind waiting for food that is delicious.\n\nThis is a very solid dinner and I feel a \"must do\" on the strip.

I like when flavor isn't mistaken for a heavy hand in salting. The Tzatziki is the best I have ever had with a creamy and thick texture freshened with cucumbers. The Htipiti was so full of a roasted bell pepper flavor, mixed with thick Greek yogurt to make any plain pita canvas fill with color and delight. Manouri cheese, tomatoes and a few Kalamata olives completed this delectable treat, truly the epitome and definition of what \"appetizer\" is.\n\nTomato Salad: DON'T let this simple name fool you. If you love olive oil, you are in for a treat. Their extra virgin olive oil is not only extra virgin but of a fresher and higher grade of olive oil than even some of the best olive oils I have had when in Italy. Their Greek spices don't disappoint and complement the oil so well. The tomatoes are so well-dressed you almost feel underdressed. A triangular wedge of feta accompanies the salad. The feta is  a good backdrop for the true stars of this salad ballad: tomatoes and olive oil. Bravo!\n\nLavraki: The bass, of course, has the most value. It has a good head (yes, I love fish heads, cheeks are the bomb diggity, yes, that's what I said!) on its shoulders and the meat is seasoned well. Simple and well done. Beware of bones. Enjoy the broccoli and squeeze some fresh lemon on your fish if you like. \n\nHonjake Salmon: One-inch thick strip of salmon that glides right off its salmon skin goes well with or without lemon juice, the same broccoli that accompanies the other fish dish, and tastes yummily fishy-fatty. Omega-3, gotta thank the Alpha and Omega for this fish.\n\nWalnut Pie with Kaimaki Ice Cream: Mmm.... You just need to try this for yourself. Shall I torture you any further using descriptions to say that the moisture of this cake, essentially, is so lavishingly divine that the ice cream is almost, almost an afterthought. Oops... \n\nYogurt Martini: Nobody in their right mind should ever go back to low-fat yogurt after having fat-full yogurt. Anyway, back from that quick tangent, the yogurt was whipped with powdered sugar, and strawberry pur\u00e9e topped the yogurt with a couple of fresh blueberries, which make you look back at their fresh fruit-and-vegetable display. \n\nMilos has several different locations: Montreal, Athens, Miami, New York, and luckily for me, Las Vegas. \n\nI wonder if all of the locations have that same grilled bread they served at the beginning, before the meal. That bread was... worth mentioning, just like everything else. \n\nThe check came out to $43.50 for my love and me. For mouthwatering thoughts, that's well worth the price.

The octopus was OK, not delicious like I was expecting for a ten dollar supplement. It was seasoned well, but really not spectacular in my opinion. My mom's crab cake was TINY. She liked it, it was good quality crab with a nice sauce, but a better, larger crab cake can be had elsewhere for much cheaper. \n           For our mains, I got the infamous sea bass while my mom got the lobster pasta. My sea bass was very good with perfect seasoning...it was just not melt in your mouth amazing like I expected. My moms pasta had a bland sauce, and the lobster was chewier than it should be. \n          For dessert, I got the walnut cake and my mom got the yogurtini. The walnut cake was yummy; it tasted like carrot cake but nuttier and crumbly. The ice cream that accompanied it was clearly Greek as it was pretty icy.

I finally had a perfect opportunity to hit the Strip on my days off, thanks to some friends visiting Las Vegas recently.\n\nI knew Estiatorio Milos would be the perfect spot to go and enjoy the best value and possibly the best tasting lunch special available on our very famous Las Vegas Strip.  And we were not disappointed.\n\nThe restaurant was fairly emptied when I walked in just after 2pm on a Tuesday on my first visit.  But the service we recieved from the restaurant staff was just great.  On my second visit when I arrived without a reservation (Comme \u00c7a was closed during lunch except on Friday-Sunday) the restaurant was fairly packed, maybe because of the MAGIC convention in town.\n\nThe three course lunch Prix Fixe ($20.12) is fairly simple, pick one item from each section (6 Appetizers, 6 Main Courses and 3 Desserts) with some selections that required an additional $10 or $15 up charge.   Overall, I thought this lunch special is healthy,  delightful and perfect for a quick lunch break for anyone that is available to take advatage of this during from noon to 2:30pm.\n\nSince I have only been to the restaurant twice, I obviously have not tried even half of their 2012 lunch menu, but below are quick comments on what I did ordered or tasted.\n\n--Appetizer--\nFresh Diver Scallop Skewer with Green Bell Pepper, Sweet Onion & Couscous.  The scallop were nicely grilled, the bell pepper pieces could have been grilled longer (grilled separately from the scallop), overall a very light and healthy hors d'\u0153uvre portion appetizer.\n\nCanadian Classic with Willy Krauch Nova Scotia Smoked Salmon, Cream Cheese, Red Onion & The World Famous St. Viateur Bagel from Montreal.  You get half a bagel with slices of smoked salmon (which was good and not overly salty) with the other ingredients on the plate for you to customize your traditional smoked salmon bagel.  The bagel itself was good, but I am not sure about it being \"world famous\".  \n\nGrilled Octopus made with Sashimi Quality Mediterranean Octopus that is charcoal-broiled.  Nice generous portion, the octopus was not overcooked and rubbery, but I will most likely not order this in future visits.\n\n--Main Course--\nLavraki, grilled Mediterranean Bass served with Broccoli.  Absolutely recommends this for anyone that loves fish. The bass is simply prepared with traditional Greek-style Mediterranean flavoring (lemon, pepper, olive oil), but when you start with good fresh fish, you don't need to overpower it with extra flavoring.  My friends and I all ordered and loved this!\n\nHonjake Salmon with Steamed Vegetable (Broccoli).  Nicely grilled, maybe a little undercooked for some people's taste, but it was perfect for me.  Again, very tradional Mediterranean flavor profile on this light lunch bite and recommended.\n\nNova Scotia Deep Sea Lobster Pasta ($15 supplementary charge). I did not ordered this but would love to try it in future visits.\n\n--Dessert--\nWalnut Cake with Kaimaki Ice Cream.  It was a good dessert, the online menu calls it a Walnt Pie but I would definitely call it a Walnut Cake.  The Kaimaki Ice cream has a unique flavor and almost chewy texture, and I read that it is commonly served with baklava and kataifi and other syrupy-sweets.  Pick this for dessert, unless you have a nut allergy.\n\nYogurt Martini.  My friends thought it was too tart, but I liked it enough to order this all for myself on my second visit. \n\nAmbiance: 5/5.  I love the lighting, layout and the generous use of white in the restaurant. The restaurant looks gorgeous on a sunny and not too overcast days during lunch.\n\nFood:  4.5/5.  Very nice lunch special menu.  Great deal at an upscale restaurant in a popular Strip property.\n\nService:  4.5/5.  The waiters are great.  On my first visit, our waiter took the time to explain the menu and even brought us the dinner menu to check out and encouraged us to visit for dinner, which he said is a different experience than their lunch.\n\nValue:  5/5.

A very tasty fish, perfectly cooked to preserve its moistness.\n\nCourse 4:  Greek walnut cake with Kaimaki ice cream.  Very tasty cake and flavorful ice cream.  \n\nThe meal came with a basked of bread--2 slices in my case--I was dining alone.  There was a small dish into which the server poured olive oil for dipping the bread.\n\nI really like the room.  The decor is very nice that I'd like to call modern rustic.

(Also -- big thanks to Jewelyn T., who tipped me off about this place!)\n\nI had the opportunity to visit Milos after a few hours of sweating it at the Boulevard pool, when I decided that it was time for something light and fresh.

Well, folks -- this is freshness distilled.

This sea bass was cooked whole, ensuring that the result was succulent and tender.  Lemon and capers provided just the right amount of acid and salt.  Simple and delicious.\n\n**COURSE 3**\nGreek yogurt martini with raspberry sauce.  Another wonderful refresher.  Unlike a boring ol' ice cream sundae, the Greek yogurt provided an excellent tang that contrasted with the sweetness of the raspberry.  The consistency of the yogurt was outstanding.\n\nThroughout lunch, I was taken care of by Buck, who was probably the friendliest and most attentive server/bartender that I'd encountered all weekend.

I was feeling like I wanted to try something I had never tried before - and not being a big red meat eater - the $50.12 dinner menu offered by Estiatorio Milos seemed just the ticket.  They also offered a Sommelier pairing of wines from mainland and northern Greece for $20.00 which we went for.  What a deal!\n\nCourse 1:  Carpaccio of Mediterranean Caught Fish with fresh herbs, citrus, afrala sea salt and extra virgin olive oil from the island of Crete.  A beautiful little starter.  The fish sliced paper thin and dusted with Sea Salt and EVOO. The fresh herbs lent a distinctly lemony flavor to the dish, which was really nice.  The salt makes it though.\n\nI really enjoyed the fact that our servers were willing to take the time and explain the dishes to us - a little background on the chef and sommelier here - where the ingredients come from, their personal opinions of the dishes.  Super fun!\n\nCourse 2:  Charcoal Grilled Mediterranean Octopus with roasted sweet peppers and assorted grilled mushrooms.  I'm not a big octopus eater, I've been underwhelmed by its texture in sushi restaurants - but after reading the Yelp reviews of this dish, I knew I had to give it a try once more.  \n\nOur server admitted this was his favorite dish on the menu - I couldn't wait.  I have to say, this dish lives up to its reputation.  The octopus was crispy-charred on the outside and so tender on the inside.  Again, sea salt made an appearance, really bringing the charcoal flavors to new heights.  The mushrooms wittily echoed the texture of the octopus, which I loved.  Praise the Goddesses, I could have just been served this dish all night and I would have been happy.\n\nCourse 3:  Grilled Mediterranean Sea Bass from the protected waters of the Greek Island, Kefalonia and horta vrasta and ladolemono. The Bass (aka Branzino) was served head and tail on de-boned for the most part except for the collar.  Another wonderful dish with clean Mediterranean flavors - a nice balance of EVOO and lemon in the ladolemono.  The horta vrasta (Boiled Leafy Greens) were reminiscent of spinach - something that I can't take too much of at one time for some reason. \n\nCourse 4:  Greek walnut cake with Kaimaki ice cream.  OK - the walnut cake was really nice. I think the waiter and the sommelier were enjoying the fact that we were intrigued with the traditions that surrounded the ingredients and the dishes we had been served...and so, Skinos. Our waiter joked with us that it was going to be something out of the ordinary and he was right.\n\nSkinos is a traditional liqueur made from the resin (or mastic) of the Mastiha tree that dates back to the ancient world.  It tastes, well, piney - in three stages. A single sip rang out with pine, then licorice, then sweet. Pine, then licorice, then sweet.  Totally intriguing and odd at the same time. The Kaimaki Ice Cream also has some derivation of mastic in it as well - so its flavors echoed the Skinos. Nice. Finished the Skinos and left happily sated and buzzed.

It was tender, flaky and had a very mild and light flavor, very nice. The broccoli it came with however was fairly soft and mushy, too overdone. I had a piece of my sister's honjake salmon. It was cooked perfectly, slightly crisp on the outside, very tender and juicy on the inside.\nDessert was the walnut pie with kaimaki ice cream. The pie's square shape and texture appearance resembles that of a piece of cornbread with a quenelle of ice cream on top of it. If you turned baklava into a cake, it would be this walnut pie. The ice cream had a hint of slightly bitter, earthy herbiness I couldn't describe. I had to ask our server and she said the flavor is due to it being made with pine resin. By itself the herbiness is a tad strong but with the walnut pie it compliments the sweetness. Not that I wouldn't mind sweet on sweet either but it was decent.\nThis definitely isn't a cheap place ordering ala carte. But you do get a great value for the tasting menu, even if you do get some extras.\nI was in between giving it 3 or 4 stars, no half star options here but the good service we received will get it a solid 4 stars.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "One of the best meals I ever had.

I heard much about their signature dishes, plus, Ruben and I stalked the menu for our selections the previous evening, so we knew exactly what we wanted.\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful. Right as the doors opened and we walked In, I exclaimed, \"Wow.\" The dining area is open, inviting, and modern. I loved the fresh produce and fish displayed near the kitchen! The patio seating looked beautiful with a nice view of the strip (I really wanted to sit out there!). The music was light and appropriate. Definitey a great ambiance.\n\nYou begin with crunchy, chewy charred/grilled sourdough bread with extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), made in-house I believe, that was delicious, fruity, and went perfectly with the bread. We had a couple baskets, hehe. \n\nWe all ordered from the prie fixe lunch menu and from the a la carte menu as well. Since there were three of us, there were many dishes to try!\n\nFor our appetizers, we shared the following:\nCALAMARI (off the a la carte menu): I couldn't walk away from a restaurant that receives fresh seafood from Greece and the Mediterranean without trying their fried calamari. This particular creature probably didn't come from either of those exotic areas (since the menu would have indicated), but nonetheless, it was delicious! Lightly fried with lemon and seasoned perfectly. The tartness and fruitiness from the lemon during its cooking process definitely set it apart from other calamari dishes. \nGREEK MEZE PLATE: A trio of Greek dips (tarama, htipati, and tzatziki) served with fresh pita bread, manouri cheese (crumbly texture similar to feta, but much milder and creamier), cherry tomatoes, and kalamata olives. The htipati had a sort of cream cheese consistency and flavor; it is a Greek feta cheese spread. The tzatziki was creamy and full-bodied; delicious. The tarama was my least favorite - it initially reminded me of a fresh mustard (I understand that traditional tarama is made other cured and salted roe); didn't care for it alone, but it went well with the other dips.\nTOMATO SALAD: Feta cheese, seasoned with Greek herbs, and EVOO. Pretty standard salad that we identify as \"Greek.\" It was light, the dressing wasn't overbearing, and the feta cheese was nice and mild.\nGRILLED OCTOPUS ($10 supplementary): Sashimi-grade Mediterranean octopus that was char-broiled, then served with olive oil, capers, onions, and herbs. AMAZING! The octopus was flavorful, fresh, and just so fabulous. Ruben doesn't even care for seafood, however, fell in LOVE with this dish!\n\nMain courses:\nLAVRAKI: Our server informed us that this was one of their signature dishes. Fresh Mediterranean sea bass grilled lightly and served with a simple coating in EVOO, fresh lemon to squeeze, and herbs. Very light and surprisingly flavorful. Sea bass is definitely not my kind of fish, so it was not my favorite dish.\nHONJAKE SALMON: Honjake is a process of raising salmon in the most natural way possible. Thus, it yields tastier results for obvious reasons. It was lightly grilled and served with fresh lemon and broccoli. The salmon was really nice with a slight crunch on the outside. The \"steamed vegetable\" on the side was disappointing; there was barely any crunch to the broccoli (one of my food preparation peeves).\nNOVA SCOTIA DEEP SEA LOBSTER PASTA ($15 supplementary): Generous amounts of lobster tail and claw meat with a perfectly al dente linguine in a light tomato sauce. Holy moly, this was phenomenal. The sauce was perfect - it had the right spices and it was flavorful. The lobster was incredible too. YUM!\n\nFor desserts, we tried the WALNUT PIE WITH KAIMAKI ICE CREAM: The \"pie\" (consistency was more like cake)  was cinnamon-y and light, a bit sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. The ice cream was..interesting. We found out it has some sort of pine residue or something, but it's a traditional Greek ice cream. I didn't like it and I told my brother that it may just be an acquired taste. I also tried the YOGURT MARTINI: Greek yogurt with some sort of raspberry compote (I can't think of what it was right now!). It was good, but pretty simple. The raspberry was a little tart for me (I'm not a fan of sour/tart), but the yogurt was creamy and of really nice quality.\n\nI would definitely go back for the octopus, calamari, and that scrumptious lobster pasta during lunch!

If it's not too hot, be sure to sit outside because it really just makes the meal that much better. \n\nI went with my co-workers and we shared a bunch of dishes and everything tasted great but here are a few of my favorites:\n\nGrilled Octopus - Had just the right amount of chewy texture. Really great flavor. Definitely a table favorite\nLobster Pasta - Most pasta dishes are the same but what I REALLY appreciated about this dish was that they were GENEROUS with their lobster portions. For a $20 lunch meal, you'd figure there'd be tons of pasta and only a little bit of lobster. No sir, they definitely piled on the lobster.\nRoasted Beets - Our group just really likes beets and this side dish was just executed really well.\nGreek coffee - SUPER SUPER sweet but that's right up my alley so I fell in love with this.

We heard they offered a great prix fixe lunch, and we ended up waiting a day for a reservation. Upon arrival, I was surprised to see a few empty tables, despite waiting customers in the lobby. Perhaps they were short-staffed? There's a small bar to the right as you enter, then a large dining room with a view of the Strip. Ask for a view table if that's important to you. \n\nThe prix fixe includes an appetizer, a main course, and a dessert for $20.13, a decent deal for a Strip resto. The staff were very attentive but I was a little disappointed our waitress wasn't more knowledgeable. I asked her the source of their salmon and she knew only that it was farmed. We decided to go with the meze plate and \"Canadian Classic\" for appetizers, the lavraki and lamb chops for the main courses, and we both had the karidopita for dessert. \n\nThe meze plate came with pita and three dips, one with cheese and roasted red peppers, tzatziki, and a dip made with some kind of white fish. All were pretty good, but none stood out. The white fish dip surprisingly didn't taste of fish at all. The Canadian Classic consisted of Nova Scotia smoked salmon and half a St Viateur bagel (one of the best bagels you can have!), served with cream cheese, red onions, capers, and a lemon wedge. This was a delicious appetizer! THe smoked salmon was creamy and briny, and the bagel tasted like it was just baked a few hours prior.\n\nLavraki is a Mediterranean seabass, a fairly firm but mildly flavored white fish. The lamb chops were available for a $10 upcharge and was served with french fries. Both were served a a broccoli shrub. I guess they don't believe in chopping things up. The bass was lightly seasoned with salt and pepper and a touch of lemon, but that was enough. The fish was fresh, cooked perfectly, and melted in your mouth. Considering the $10 charge, I expected a bit more than than the two small lamb chops that were served. They were also a little underdone (I asked for medium and they were served medium rare), but very tasty. \n\nKaridopita is a Greek walnut cake flavored with cinnamon and moistened with a light simple syrup. It was served at Milos with an interesting mint and evergeen flavored ice cream. The cake was moist and sweet, but not cloyingly so, and airy. The crumb was a bit rough, but that could be normal for this cake. The ice cream was really the star, in my opinion. I wouldn't call it delicious but the flavor was so interesting, I wanted more than the dollop atop the cake.\n\nAll in all, we thoroughly enjoyed the meal here, and particularly thought the prix fixe was well worth it for the quality of food.

I had never been here before, but have only herd good things. \n\nAs soon as we walked in, we were rudely greeted by the one out of two hostesses that were at the host stand. No smile, no energy, no welcoming \"Thanks for joining us at our restaurant by spending your hard earned money and keeping me in the job\" vibe, NOTHING. Crazy, in my opinion, we should have left, but didn't because the plans to eat here were already in affect. \n\nWe were seated promptly, and had a nice view of their wine room that is encased in glass. Pretty cool. Our server was very friendly, and had just started there a few months prior. She gave us some recommendations, and we followed through with them. \n\nFor my appetizer I ordered the \"Grilled Octopus\"(refer to pic)($10 additional fee). The octopus was charcoal-broiled perfectly, and was good. Maybe I like more \"Eclectic\" food, but this was just so simple. The octopus was accompanied by red onions and capers with the plate being drizzled with oil. Nothing amazing, just good. We Also ordered the \"Milos Special\", which was lightly fried zucchini and eggplant w/ tzatziki & kefalograviers cheese. This, center shared appetizer, was delicious! The zucchini and eggplant were fried PERFECTLY. The yogurt sauce, that was inside the stack of fried veggies, added such a nice tang, that really balanced all of flavors flawlessly and made all of us go back for more. \n\nThe birthday boy ordered the \"Crab Cake\"(refer to pic)($10 additional fee) appetizer. From what I tried, the cake was okay... just very simple, small, and had nothing special going on. The b-day boy regretted ordering it.\n\nFor my lunch entree I ordered the servers recommendation, the \"Lavraki\"(refer to pic). This Mediterranean bass is a \"specialty at Milos\". After finding three(3) pin bones in my fish, I figured it wasn't as \"SPECIAL\" as the server mentioned. The fish was cooked well, but once again... nothing special. When you are eating at such an upscale restaurant, you expect amazing flavors, quality, service, and atmosphere. It was blowing my mind that there was such a simplistic approach with no added spark, and still errors and missteps. \n\nMy friend ordered the \"Nova Scotia Deep Sea Lobster Pasta\"(refer to pic)($15 additional fee), which he thought was an absolute, complete joke. The pasta was tossed in a red, tomato sauce and was accompanied by the top and bottom half of the lobster, while the middle of the lobster was the pasta. It was absurd. The pasta came out lukewarm, and he didn't want to inconvenience anyone, so he didn't want to complain. I thought the pasta had some good flavors, but the presentation was... just a hot mess. \n\nFor dessert I had the server order for me. She brought out a \"Yogurt Martini\"(refer to pic) which was tangy, tart, and good for what it was.. Greek yogurt inside of a martini glass. The b-day boy ordered the \"Walnut Cake w/ Kaimaki Ice Cream\"(refer to pic) which we thought was moist, and delicious. I was envious of his dessert. No candle was given, or even a \"happy birthday\" but that's understandable. All the other standards of food quality, service standards, etc.. were disappointing.\n\nOverall, the meal was a bust.

We were wondering if he'd be put off by that, but he was totally cool and told us that when he eats there himself he usually just orders the apps.  He made some great recommendations.  Based on his advice we went with the Milos Special which is very thin slices of eggplant and zucchini, that are lightly breaded and fried.  They come all piled up in a beehive shape with a fork in the middle.  You spin the fork around and they all kind of topple out and there's tzatziki sauce in the middle.  This is not your average gyro sauce that you end up tasting the rest of the day.  It's very light and absolutely delicious.  The veggies were so lightly fried they never felt heavy.  Beats out chips any day!  It also comes with pieces of white cheese that you eat warm.  An excellent app.  Our second app was the charred octopus (another Kevin recommendation).

I'm sure it is and I'll might try it the next time I'm in Vegas.   And if I was on an expense account or, as I assume from what I could observe of many of my fellow patrons when we were there, using my daddy's (or my sugar daddy's) credit card, a lavish, no holds barred dinner here would be a pleasant way to spend an evening without a care in the world,  Service that we had sitting at the bar was very professional, but I'm cutting them some slack for gently pushing the purchase of the restaurant's olive oil (a touch tacky, I think).\n\nThe problem is that the price of the dishes in the evening, given what you receive, is way out of line with the value.  Now,  I'd guess that many of my fellow patrons could give a flying fig about dollar value, but that's not how I roll.  I can justify dropping many hundreds of dollars for a meal for two on occasion if I was presented with dish after dish with double plus wow factor.  Here though, we're talking about relatively simple Mediterranean cuisine centered on Greek cooking.   I love that stuff big time, as it is the food that launched the cultures of the Greeks, the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the southern Spanish and French.  But no matter how much effort goes into sourcing the best or freshest this or that, at the end of the day you're dealing with a few ingredients cooked in a straightforward manner, maybe a couple of minutes on a grill, steamed to get just beyond raw, or pasta\\rice tossed in boiling water just long enough to still have a little tooth to it.  Simple food from a land that is relatively poor.\n\nThat's why I have to give Milos a 2 star based on our single visit just sampling the appetizer selections: this is simple food that is insanely expensive, albeit clearly involving good ingredients.  I can't give you exact prices (the menu on their website is outdated) but here is an example.  We ordered the grilled sardines.  This dish, a staple of the impoverished fishing villages of Portugal that involves simply brushing on a little olive oil and salt and tossing on a BBQ, was something like $22.  For that amount of money we received all of....four small sardines.  If the Greeks got over $5 for a fish the size of your index finger, they wouldn't be in a financial crisis right now.  The bottarga (grey mullet roe) was nearly $30, but turned out to be four tiny crackers with a sliver, and I mean a sliver, of cured roe.  The grilled octopus was very tasty, and the portion size we received was enough for two folks for sure, but at close to $30 the value simply wasn't there.  And perhaps the worst offender was the least expensive: the taramosalata was so bland and un-fish-like that we initially thought they had served us an order of hummus.  Even if it was under $10, and it certainly wasn't (maybe closer to $20), it wasn't worth what we had paid.\n\nI guess I'm just cranky though, because the place was packed with folks ordering the $300 grouper and thinking nothing about dropping $65 for a couple of lamb chops.  For me though, I'll save my money and spend it at a true Mediterranean restaurant that gives you decent bang for the buck.  \n\nNick in Palm Springs\n\nP.S.: How can a restaurant named \"Estiatorio Milos\" offer only a single variety of Ouzo?

Indeed, they have upped the price, but I don't think $2 is much more for what you are getting. However, if they upped the price anymore than that I would think twice about coming here for this particular Pre=Fixe.\n\nI believe one of the best ways to eat well, in fancy places, and get the bang for your buck is to eat happy hours, lunch, and Pre-Fixe menus. Numerous fancy-dancy places in Vegas offer these menus in their \"off\" times (IE: not dinner) and this accommodates especially locals very well. I imagine the meal I had at this particular lunch would have set me back a whole lot more than 20 bucks-ish had I been dining during a \"dinner\" time at Milos. With that being said, onto the food:\n\nFirst Course - Meze Plate\nComes with three sauce, pita bread, cheese, one tomato and one olive. I really wanted another kalamata olive. Why just one Milos?! Why?! Oh right, presentation or something probably. I chose the meze plate because I wanted an option to just get my palate going before I had my main course. The other first courses on the menu are quite sumptuous (scallops, octopus, etc.) However, the meze plate eases you into your meal in a nice way, being able to play with which flavors you slather onto your pita bread. I enjoyed the dish and the presentation.\n\nSecond Course - Sea Bass\nA fish you'll wish you could eat every time you eat fish. It is presented sliced in half, tail and head still attached (please do what you can to scrape some meat out of the head - I did!). The flavor is - buttery, meaty white fish. If you don't know what that tastes like, then order this dish and enjoy. My fish did not have too many bones, I believe I probably ran into about 5-6. However, my friend's fish seemed to be loaded, so just be careful when eating.\n\nThird Course - Walnut Cake\nMeh. I was not impressed and wished I had ordered another dessert. This cake was dry and tasted like gingerbread. I'm not a fan. The ice cream on top was the only reason I could stomach the whole piece. Had the ice cream not been on top I would have just left it on the plate after the first couple bites.\n\nService - Genteel, warm, friendly, upscale, quick, we were not forgotten, nor were we hovered over. When we arrived the place was empty, when we left it was totally full. So kudos to management and servers for keeping a service exceptional through a lunch rush.\n\nOverall - A decent Pre-Fixe to try out. Since Milos specializes in seafood, those who may not want to dump a whole lot of money into such a specialized restaurant should consider the Pre-Fixe option and then decide whether or not they would return for full price. Now, if I had a hankering for seafood and had some extra money to throw around I would definitely return to Milos, probably with out-of-town friends to wow them.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 5, "useful": 11, "cool": 6}}, {"text": "Not a lot to say about it just over price fish place....

As expensive as dinner can be, Estiatorio Milos offers what I think is one of the best lunch deals on the Strip - a 3-course, $22.13 menu. Six appetizers are available to choose from (two with supplemental pricing), six entrees (two with supplemental pricing), and three dessert options. The tempting pricing supplements, which range from $10-15 extra, can quickly drive the prix-fixe up, but there are attractive options when sticking to the $22 menu as well.\n\nBread is served warm, crusty on the outside and very soft on the inside. Fruity olive oil is served instead of butter, something I actually prefer almost every time.\n\nFried Calamari fresh calamari, lightly fried with lemon - This starter isn't part of the fixed menus, but was one of the house specialties so we gave it a try. The batter was light and crispy, delicate with tender squid. With a light squeeze of lemon, these were simple but delicious bites. However at $24 a plate, there isn't a ton of value here since you could get another 3-course for less.\n\nFresh Diver Scallop Skewer with green bell pepper, sweet onion & couscous - My mother had these skewered scallops; cooked well, these were tender and moist. Some sweetness from bell peppers and onion were a welcome accompaniment.\n\nGrilled Octopus sashimi quality Mediterranean octopus, charcoal-broiled - A $10 supplement, this was one of the better dishes of the lunch. Extremely tender, the octopus was contrasted with a bright onion flavor and fresh parsley. Loved the texture.\n\nFresh Maryland Lump Crab Cake with marinated gigantes beans & mustard emulsion - Another $10 supplement from the appetizer options, I liked the delicate crust of the crab cake but overall flavors were fairly muted. Not bad, but not the most interesting.\n\nWe tried four of the entree options.\n\nLavraki grilled Mediterranean bass - This was a hit; the dense flesh of the bass was very moist and the skin was oh-so-crispy. A touch of fruity olive oil and salty capers were a nice addition to the fish, which didn't need much more.\n\nOrganic Chicken Breast Skewer grilled mushrooms & onions, served over pita - My cousin got this dish; the lone piece of chicken that I tried was pretty dry.\n\nColorado USDA Prime Lamb Chops french fries & broccoli - My grandmother opted for the lamb chops ($10 supplement), cooked a nice medium rare. Tender and juicy, this was a good option for someone wanting to avoid the seafood route.\n\nNova Scotia Deep Sea Lobster Pasta light tomato sauce - I went for this dish. Although the $15 pricing supplement was relatively steep, there seemed to be a lot of value in this dish. A whole small lobster was carefully broken apart, leaving the meat bathed within linguini and a light tomato cream sauce. The lobster was just a touch more cooked than what I would've liked, but was sweet and tasty nonetheless. The pasta had a nice richness without being too heavy.\n\nFor dessert, we tried two of the three options.\n\nFresh Fruits of the Season - Pretty much as advertised.\n\nWalnut Cake with Kaimaki ice cream - The cake was sweet, slightly earthy, and pretty moist. The ice cream was refreshing; interestingly, it's made from the resin of mastic trees, native to Greece.\n\nWe enjoyed our meal here and I wouldn't mind returning for lunch. I wouldn't say it was good enough to inspire a visit for a $100+ dinner, though. The scallops and Lavraki fish would make an excellent $22 lunch meal; in terms of the supplements, I'd splurge on the octopus and lobster pasta again.

The waiter to describe the octopus to be as tender as a pork chop kind of thing(I think that's what he said). Regardless it was really delicious and it wasn't super chewy. Simply wonderful\n\nThe Mediterranean bass made me really think about how amazing it is that it only cost FREAKING $22.13! You're seriously getting what you are paid for. The bass was light hearted and the waiter to tells us to eat from the tail to the head and as you go up to the fish head, there will  be bones. It was a really light dish with a really nice and citrus and acidity sauce that was on the bottom of the bass. The bass was cooked well and it wasn't overcooked and dried up. Definitely a recommendation to get. \n\nI had a small bite of the lamb chops(I don't like lamb) and it was ACTUALLY VERY GOOD. It didn't have that lamb taste which was why I liked it a lot! If you got me liking your lamb dish, you are one heck of a restaurant. BUT MAN THAT $15 to add the lobster pasta was just WOOOO.

The atmosphere was elegant, and each table was laden with a swanky lookin group of people or cute couples on dates. The dress code, for the most part, is semi-casual, but we were dressed casually and didn't feel out of place. \n\nWe were greeted by our \"drink server\"... At least that's what I remember him for. I told him what kind of drinks I normally like, which, lately, is vodka and nothing too sweet. He came out with a refreshing vodka cucumber cocktail. My boyfriend got the \"them apples\" martini, and my friend got a scotch and soda. $15-18 each drink.\n\nNext off, we were greeted by our food server. The whole ordering process with our  food server is what may have thrown me off from the entire dining experience. I felt that he was somewhat pushy and rushed us to order. Here's the thing about Milo's dinner experience. If you plan to order fish (which our server made it seem like you should know from the get-go what you want without looking at the menu ugh... -_-), then you get to take a look at the \"fish market\" and you get to pick out the fish you would like. They filet it up, grill it and serve it family style at your table (FYI everything is family style). Each fish is anywhere from $50-60/lbs. Most of it looked fresh, but I'm really not impressed by how the server presented, he gave brief descriptions, went down the line, and then expected us to have a choice after his rambling. I feel like having him explain 10 different kinds of fish right then and there and expecting me to choose one right off the bat, forced me into choosing a lobster lol... A $108 dollar lobster--my goodness!\n\nAnyhow, lets talk about the food! For starters, they brought out a bread basket along with our 12 dozen of fresh oysters--probably my favorite part of our meal. We had 2 different kinds, I forget what they were called, but one was more briney in flavor while the other one was creamier. Both awesome! I think this came out to $40? Ish? Lol\n\nAfter what seemed like forever (maybe 30 minutes, pretty long time for a salad if you ask me), our Greek salad came out. Served family style, the salad was comprised of beef steak tomatoes, chopped into chunks, sliced cucumbers, green bell peppers, and olives tossed in a light vinaigrette, topped with two fresh slices of feta cheese. It was good, but the tomatoes could have been sweeter--I mean for $28, you deserve sweet tomatoes right? ;)\n\nNext, the lobster came out along side the filet that we ordered (yeah, we decided to order a filet mignon, as well). The lobster was boiled, cut in half, and served up simple and pretty on a platter. It was pretty big! Juicy, tender, not at all rubbery, it was delicious! If it wasn't $108, I'd eat it all the time lol! The filet mignon was nothing spectacular. I mean, it was really good, but come on--we live in Vegas, there's a million steakhouses out here, and this piece of filet wasn't changing my life haha... It came out to $68 (I think?). I also ordered a Greek wine, which drank like a pinot noir, it was pretty good ($15) with the steak.\n\nAnyhow, the three of us shared all the food, and the bill came out to about $350 including tip. My poor boyfriend and friend were still hungry after our meal haha!\n\nMaybe I just need to give it another shot, but I wasn't very happy about our dinner experience at Milo's. Our pushy server may have been what made it so lame, but I wasn't too ecstatic by the prices either. To me, the food and service didn't fit the bill. If you've got the money, give it a go.

I hesitate to say the food was terrible because it had no flavor so it couldn't have a bad flavor. Just nothing at all.\n\nOnce we were all there, our waiter took us over to their impressive display of fish which he then bragged were flown in fresh each morning from across the world. But all of these fish contained utterly outrageous price tags. By far the most expensive entree I ate in my many months in Vegas. Nevertheless, the leader of our group picked out two fish and ordered a bit of steak for the table as well. \n\nWhen the food finally came out - don't expect anything to occur quickly at Milos - there was just no flavor in anything. Both fish were as bland as could possibly be and there was still the occasional bone left in the fish. Are you kidding?!

I made a huge mistake by not complaining, getting something else and alerting management. However, I was with company and did not want to make a scene. I actually think this is one of the best restaurants in town that is known for fish yet prepared us the worst fish I've ever eaten no exaggeration. \nI will definitely be back for everything else on the menu besides whole fish. Unless it's someone else's dime I will never risk 225 on a fish here again.

I think most Americans don't think much of Greek food outside of gyros and baklavas, but my cabbie from the airpot was Greek and said I should check this place out or he'd dump me out in North Las Vegas and kill me and dump my body in the desert.  I started off at the bar and the bartender was very helpful with the wines which was all Greek to me.  Yes, I'm going to abuse that line many times in this review.  Most of the by-glass was Greek, and I told him what I usualy drank, Gallo, and he punched me in the face.  I told him I like Willamette Pinot and he offered me a taste of an Agiorgitiko that was almost a carbon copy of Willamette Pinot.  The guy knew his stuff.  Excellent bar service.  My date arrived and we hit the tables, literally, I was a bit drunk.  We were escorted to the fish display which is like one of those fish market displays with the fish in ice and the prices per pound, except these prices were much higher than I'm used to, even at Whole Foods.  We're talking $57/lbs and the like, but they fly them in fresh straight from the Mediterranean, so Fedex or DHL accounts for $10/lb or something like that.  They probably also get one of those EU VAT (Value Added Taxes) added on top of that.  Not the most environmental thing to do, express shipping fish from the Mediterranean, but this is the authentic Greek experience and well worth it.  The cabbie told me that the Greeks grill fish in a very special way.  The St. Pierre that we chose also known as a John Dory is a white, soft, mild tasting fish.  The sauce was light, so I ventured to ask for melted butter.  The waiter told me to leave immediately.  Actually, he politely informed me that the Greek do not like to overwhelm the taste of the meat with sauces like the French do, and I dunked my St. Pierre in butter and thanked him for the Anthony Bourdain lesson.  It tasted soooooo much better slathered in butter.  I'm not ashamed in the least.  We were in Vegas and we should do as the Vegans do, order A1 with a filet mignon, melted butter with a John Dory, American mustard with a bratwurst.  I actually went to Hofbrauhaus with friends earlier and one friend was annoyed they didn't have American mustard for his weiner.  Probably the best part of the meal was the dessert.  My date ordered a baklava.  She had never had baklava.  I always thought better of her, but if you haven't had baklava by your 30's, you obviously have lived a sheltered life.  I went out on a limb and ordered something I never heard of before, Galaktoboureko.  I couldn't pronounce it and just pointed to the item like I do at Chinese restaurants.  While the baklava was okay, we shared the Galaktoboureko and my date fell out of her chair.  I was highly impressed too.  I asked the waiter what it was again, and he said, \"Galactic Bootie Call,\"  It was a Galactic Bootie Call for my mouth.  \n\nWhen you look for fine dining, the typical American will pick some fancy steak house, French or Italian place.  I don't know why national cuisines seem to be categorized by price range.  I mean, nobody thinks of taking their date out to an expensive Ecuadorian or Kenyan restaurant.  I think it's racist.  The Italians aren't even rich people.  They were part of the EU PIGS, the countries that almost sank the entire EU economy during the Great Recession.  Dubai is one of the richest countries in the world, but you never hear of an expensive Dubai restaurant.  Americans are also some of the riches, but go to Europe or Asia and all they think of American cuisine is McDonalds and BBQ ribs or something.  \n\nIf you want a change of pace from the old, boring, conventional French, Italian, steakhouse or even expensive sushi or now expensive tapas joint, check this place out and you will be pleasantly surprised.

It set a pretty high standard for itself, and hit the mark dead on, then while the mark was down on the floor, it kicked it a few times to ensure it hit it. Let's take it from the top.\n\nThe restaurant is decorated in an elegant, somewhat minimalist manner. Nothing really screams greek about the place, and there's a huge fish display right infront of the kitchen area, with lots of ice and seafood. My girlfriend felt displays like this were a waste, but they actually come by the display and take fish off of it and into the kitchen.\n\nStarting with the appetizer, I instantly went for the octopus (+$10), while my girlfriend had the scallop. I noticed a number of reviews had stated the octopus was extremely tender - mine was actually not tender. It wasn't tough at all either, or rubbery. I think the texture could be described as dense, meaty octopus. I think I'd liken it to eating cheese (which sounds gross, but bear with me here), where your teeth cut through it slowly. The octopus itself was very flavorful as well. Definitely the winner of the lunch, and probably the best I've ever had. The scallop was grilled well, and not waterlogged or milky. My girlfriend didn't talk much while eating it, so you know she was enjoying it (ha).\n\nFor our mains, my girlfriend had the lamb, and I had the grilled bass. The bass was simple, but expertly prepared. The capers were a welcome addition with a spot of acidity to balance out the olive oil, and I really didn't see many bones at all despite the waiter's warning. My girlfriend enjoyed her lamb, but didn't think it was the best she's ever had. She didn't touch the steak fries, but I loved them. This place makes some damn fine steak fries. Not mealy, but retains a sort of fluffiness that's not usually found in steak fries, with a crisp exterior.\n\nDessert was pretty forgettable, to be honest. The yogurt was a step above the supermarket greek yogurt, but nothing to fawn over. The fresh fruit plate was... a fresh fruit plate. Both were lighter options as a finish to a \"light\" meal.\n\nWe each made out at 33.13 before tax and tip, which we agreed was well worth the money for the quality of food you get here.

We thought it was good but figured dinner here would be out of reach.  Yesterday I get a call from him around 3 PM asking if I wanted to have dinner here with his uncle.  Both of us have a lot of really cool uncles who seem to visit Vegas often and treat us to nice dinners.  I would never turn this down!  Reservations were set for 8 which gave me plenty of time to run errands after work.\n\nWe arrived fashionably at 8:04 and were seated immediately.  Four of us dined without abandon.  We all had cocktails - I tasted the cucumber-based \"In the Know\" and the apple one, but opted for the \"Sticky Rice\" with tanqueray, plum preserves, and jasmine syrup.  It sounded me-ish and it was delicious.  We were given grilled bread and a fruity olive oil to start.  Then the ordering commenced.  The server said due to the east coast weather, they were limited on types of fish and oysters and were out of the octopus (gasp) and sardines.  Bummer!\n\nFirst, we opted for apps only.  Eric R. and I shared the Raw bar tasting, which normally has 4 types of fish but due to this shortage it had 3.  It included bigeye tuna with YUZU kosho!!!, salmon with fresno chile and shallot, and some white fish that ended up being quite excellent considering I do not often get white fish sashimi.  I also ordered 3 oysters from Washington state, and we got the grilled shrimp app with endive salad.  The other guests ordered the mushroom side as an app and so I tried abalone, trumpet, and shiitakes and they were great of course.  Eric R. also got taramasalata which was nothing like any I have had before - the roe was not visible, and Eric thought it tasted and looked like hummus (to me the taste was closer to taramasalata) but they did not give us anything to eat it with for probably 20 minutes - we had to ask for bread from 3 different people, and it was the least interesting thing to eat on the table.\n\nNext, we ordered Greek salads - everyone spotted the beautiful Canadian (hah) tomatoes near the bar and the salads are just tomatoes, feta, cucumber, red onion, olive, and green pepper - no lettuce.  Eric R. and I split one and I ended up with leftovers for today which I am eating now, yum!  We ordered the whole opakapaka for the table prepared simply with olive oil and lemon and had the server split it tableside.  It was delicate and tasty, and I could only eat half.  I tried the fish cheek which was cool.\n\nFor sides, we got chard, broccoli, roasted beets, and sweet onions.  I was the only beet eater so I got to take those home too.  The rest of the sides were okay.  No room for dessert!  Because I am local, I am fortunate enough to take the delicious extra food home which I am sure many tourists do not do.  This meal was delicious from start to finish which service pretty personable throughout.

First of all, you made me miss Christmas dinner/sit through 90 min show hungry and thought that I would be happy with free 2 glasses of wine? But I didn't need more comps. I told him that we owed what we ate and would gladly pay. All I wanted was for someone to take accountability and at least give us a sincere apology.

Their lunch menu, which is priced beautifully at $22.14, features a tasting of seafood that allows you to close your eyes and really visit the mediterranean, even if it's just for a couple hours. \n\nAPPETIZER:\nFor a starter, it was HIGHLY recommended to get the Grilled Octopus, which is composed of sashimi grade imported Mediterranean octopus, which has been charcoil broiled with what appears to be an amazing, fruity, olive oil. This dish DOES have a $10 supplement. Dishes with supplements are a tossup for me. Sometimes it's a win, while others can be a joke. This one is the former - WELL worth it. Amelinda L. joked that she could eat a whole plate of it and although I believed her, after I tried it, I began echoing her sentiment. Truly delicious. I think that what made it so delicious was really the quality of the seafood, and the preparation just made it shine. \n\nTHE MAIN:\nMy main course choice was also recommended to me - the Shrimp Saganaki with tomato and feta cous cous. The flavoring of the Shrimp was so flavorful and perfectly cooked, allowing for the tenderness of the protein to really compliment the flavors. The cous cous was simply bursting with that earthy, rustic flavor with the feta and tomato, and was an amazing compliment. I just wished there were more of it!\n\nDESSERT:\nLastly, I had The Real Greek Yogurt for the dessert. If you love true Greek yogurt - the thickly textured stuff, that's tart and makes your mouth pucker a bit -- then this is for you. A lot of people enjoy Fage and Oikos greek yogurt, but that's on the sweeter side. This is a little more tart but I love it. My recommendation for you if you prefer something on the sweeter side is to get the fresh fruit plate, which Amelinda L. got. It contained a really fresh mix of fruit that was beautifully prepared (with the exception of what looked like a peeled Cutie - just seemed like there could have been a little more effort there - ha!). Sharon L. got the greek yogurt like me and she found it too tart. \n\nDRINK: I ordered a jasmine tea, which was strong and allowed for two brews, which they kindly accomodated. \n\nThe service was top notch, and the environment simply amazing. There's a display of fresh fish on ice towards the kitchen, which was semi-open (but not loud at all) and the view from the windows were lovely. \n\nI'd recommend this as a great choice for locals and visitors alike.

And that is saying a lot. I have eaten at some of the best restaurants around. Ok, here is the absolutely no-risk lineup:  \n\nFirst, skip the table bread. It is nothing special and you do NOT want to get filled up with bread. \n\nSecond, order the Milos Special. Unbelievable. This easily serves 3-4 at the table. It is reminiscent of chips and dip BUT blessed by the Greek Gods. Savory fried zucchini and eggplant chisp with with tzatziki and a fried Greek cheese. You cannot stop eating it. Truly fantastic. \n\nThird, order the Greek Salad. Sounds fairly pedestrian. It is not. It is exquisite. I don't know how else to describe it. Las Vegas weekly calls it \"simple perfection\" and I cannot disagree. I promise you that you will rave about it. My wife and I split it because we have more menu items coming. \n\nFourth, order the lamb. People call us crazy when we do that. Milos is, after all, known for their remarkable seafood. And we have eaten widely and happily among the seafood selection until . . . blam, we tried the lamb one day. Heaven. Since that moment, we have never ordered another main entre. And everyone I have cajoled and begged into trying it has blessed my name forever more. It is the most succulent cut of meat that you can eat. Perfectly seasoned bliss. Every bite. It is impossible to oversell the thing.  \n\nFinally, if you have sat for awhile and have some room for dessert: I recommend \"The Real Greek Yogurt\" selection. It is not for everyone. It is a wonderful heavy and tart Greek Yogurt offset with honey and walnuts. The contrasting flavors is delicious to me. But not everyone is overcome like I am with it. And, honestly, none of the desserts on the same scale as the three items I recommend above. \n\nIn summary, I swear to you that if you order: (1) Milos Special; (2) Greek Salad and (3) Lamb, you will have one of the best dinners you have ever had in your life.

The food fantastic; fresh, simple and delicious.  The lunch menu is a great deal and the wine pairing ($16 for two half glasses, highly recommend) was very enjoyable.  We ordered the saganaki (fried cheese) off the meze menu (not on the regular lunch menu) - it was wonderful, deep fried I think and not soaked in grease like it can usually be, the lemon squeezed on top finished it perfectly, recommended.  For first courses we tried the meze dips and tomato salad, for mains the fish and shrimp, and for dessert the Greek yogurt (of course) - We would recommend all or any of that - it was all very good.\nOur waiter was wonderful, welcoming, knowledgeable, kind and attentive.\nThe letdown came in the timing which I'm not sure who to fault .... Kitchen or waiter.... But it was rushed and unprofessional.  When we first sat down (12:30 pm) our waiter asked if we had any time constraints, we told him no that we would like to have a leisurely lunch.  It should be noted the restaurant was not even 1/2 full the entire time we were there.  We ordered the saganaki and hesitated ordering the rest of the meal as we did not want to be rushed, but our waiter assured us he would not put our lunch order in until our appy was done, which he did oblige.  The problem came when we were finishing our first course our main arrived, and the service staff literally sweeped in moving our first course plates out of the way to make room for our mains.  So now we're put in a position where you have to decide if you want to finish your first course while your main gets cold or just start eating the main.  For this calibre of restaurant I found that extremely disappointing.  Furthermore I saw the same thing happen to at least 2 other tables around us, and they had the same bewildered look we did.... There's no way I can give even 4 stars when diners are faced with that sort of issue leaving you uncomfortable and rushed, it completely takes away from the rest of the what would have been wonderful lunch.

What we got was basically a Greek 'fish house', which for my vegetarian partner in cuisine crime, negated the point of going.  The idea that hummus and such was 'passe' took the Greek out of the Greek for her.  But putting that aside --\n\n-- why ditch a lovely restaurant in the Cosmo for being a fish house?  Simple:  they attempted to scam us.\n\nWe sat down at a table and we were not brought menus.  Instead a nice waiter type arrives and informs us of 'how things work'.

Is there ANYTHING ELSE on the menu besides fish?  Why yes, of course, but the waiter gave you the impression he'd rather not go there.  That you'd kind of be a loser to not be in a fish mood in this Greek fish 'emporium'.\n\nDo you feel that at the back of your neck yet?  That something seems off?  Let me give you another hint:  the waiter waxed poetic about how all their fish is flown in fresh.   At first this sounds impressive.  Until you remember you're in the Mojave Desert.

We were hungry and it was close to 7 so we decided to eat at Cosmo. He had never tried Milo's before so I told him he simply had to. Since we'd been running around doing errands we weren't exactly dressed up but I mean who really cares? It's Vegas. We walked into the restuarant and went to the hostesses and asked if we could get a table for 3. I apologized for not dressing up, saying how normally I did but we'd been running errands all day. She literally wrinkled her nose and stated that they were fully booked till 930. But if we wanted to wait we could. I mean, this bitch didn't even try to hide her look of disdain. Maybe it was the yoga pants and tank top, maybe it was because I had my son.

There were 6 different slots available before 930. I promptly booked the 730 slot then proceeded to call. When she answered I asked to speak to her supervisor. When he got on the phone I told him what happened and he assured me that there was no dress code and that they didn't discriminate. He was very nice and professional and apologized for her rotten attitude. When we walked back in at 720 they didn't even ask to see my reservation. She sat us promptly. We ordered drinks and went up to the fish market and picked our fish. I picked the sea bass and he picked the sole. Our son was looking at the fish horrified so I ordered him the filet since they didn't have chicken on the menu, I lied and told him it was chicken/steak lol. \n\nThe service was wonderful and we ordered the Milo's Special which is always a favorite.

I have been driving by this place for years and I finally decided that it was time to actually give it a shot.\n\n   This is a quaint little place, nothing fancy, just down to earth little eatery, with walk up counter ordering and sit down service.  What I really enjoyed was when I walked up to the counter you can see into the kitchen and it was actually really clean and you can watch as your food is prepared, always a plus for me.  So far this place is looking pretty good.  Picture menu above the counter was pretty informative with the exception of most of the items were not priced, which I thought was strange, but I got over it, heh.\n\n   Now to the important part, the food.  I ordered the classic Gyro sandwich and Dolmas (stuffed grape leaves).  The Gyro was actually pretty tasty and presented quite simply with kebab meat, Tzatziki sauce, lettuce, and raw white onion, wrapped in paper.  It also came with a side of fries, which were the standard frozen variety, so nothing special, but not bad at the same time.  The Dolmas were pretty good as well.  I think there were about six of them plated on a bed of lettuce, a couple slices of cucumber, a couple pieces of feta cheese and several olives.  Definitely not the best Dolmas I have ever had, but certainly not the worst either, but no complaints.\n\n   The value of this place is solid.  I got the Gyro, the Dolmas, and a soda for $13 and change.  It's definitely a place to grab a solid meal.  It's quick, it's affordable and it's conveniently located to me.

A generic white and blue sign at the end of a mostly vacated strip mall on an obscure street corner in the outskirts of what is somehow still considered \"Metro\" Phoenix that reads \"Chicago's Number One Gyro\" could easily be mistaken for a defunct insurance office or haphazard dry cleaners in this part of town. However, upon entering, it turns out to be quite the quaint establishment with adequate, close-knit seating on the inside and a small patio outside for those who wish to work on their tans while they eat. The small cafe atmosphere makes it a great stop for meeting friends or grabbing a quick bite on the run. The eatery is sparsely staffed, but the employees (i.e. owners?) are pleasant and happy to answer any questions you have about the food or direct you to items you might be interested in trying if you're the indecisive type like my girlfriend. \n\nThe menu features a decent selection of both Authentic Greek and Americanized-Greek favorites like Beef and Chicken Shish Kebobs, Souvlaki and a solid selection of Pita-based sandwiches, including the classic \"Gyros\" (pronounced \"Yee-Rose\") pita. Alongside these main entree offerings are a few oddballs like Philly Cheesesteaks, Spicy Beef Sandwiches and real Chicago-style Hot Dogs, which help justify the quirky name outside. Side dishes include great tasting standards like Hummus, French Fries and Salads, all in the $2-$4 range. A small selection of Greek pastries are also on display for dessert, but you may not get to them, as most entree portions, aside from the Pita sandwiches, are fairly generous. The Sandwiches come standard with a handful of French Fries and run an average of $5-$6, depending on the meat you choose. \n\nThe larger \"Plate\" combos come with a fresh Greek Salad and your choice of meat on a bed of their great Basmati Rice for around $8. Plates can run up to $12 if you wish to add additonal meat portions, which is actually an economical option for anyone who doesn't mind sharing. Grab a 3-meat plate, a side of Hummus and a couple drinks and you'll have a tasty, date-worthy meal in a cozy and casual diner for under $20 out-the-door!\n\nOverall, the quality of the ingredients was top-notch, the taste was excellent and there's enough selection on the menu to keep the taste buds interested throughout multiple visits.

Once we got our orders we headed back to the house to eat as there was no room in the dinning room at the restaurant. Anyways my first bite of this great Greek style sandwich was full of flavor. The creamy tzatziki mixed with the spiced flavor of the meat and was great. It was one of the better Greek items I have had in a while.

While it's a quick serve restaurant and I didn't plan on five star service, a mere \"hello\", \"thank you\" or a simple smile would have been nice.

The fixin's (romaine, tomato and onion) were crisp, cool and plentiful, but I didn't care for the rectangular strips of chicken at all. They didn't look, smell, have the texture of or even taste like chicken.

The texture of the falafel wasn't particularly great: the whole thing was fairly mushy.  There was no contrast between the fried exterior and the usually much softer interior.  The flavor profile, likewise, was not my favorite either.  The falafel tasted quite a bit like pumpkin bread due to the spice combinations they'd used.

Well, three places we went had long wait times. Discouraged, we were driving towards home when we saw that the posidon restaurant had finally opened up. Being a big fan of georges gyros and greek food in general, I had looked foward to this place opening since they had a sign up months ago. We pulled in and there were only two customers there, but the smell was great, like garlic and gyro meat. We were seated by a friendly waiter and received our menus, along with glasses of water. The water(which I care about) wasnt bad, like most valley places. It was definitely filtered water with unfiltered ice. \nMy husband still wanted breakfast food, and upon looking over the menu we noticed very good prices, extremely pocket friendly. We were hopeful but concerned that it might be too cheap.\nWe placed the order for the kids breakfast which was one egg,one pancake,one piece sausage,one slice bacon, pita triangles and one piece of ham for 2.95! great deal, especially for my 31/2 year old daughter and the pancake was about 6 inches across. Hubby decided on the greek style breakfast which was 3 eggs with onions tomatoes mushrooms gryo meat and sausage served with potatoes for 6.95. he substituted french fries for potatoes. I ordered the gyro combo with fries, for 6.95, which came with soup or salad. We also ordered spanokopita, orange juice and a coke. Everything was great and decently portioned. I was very happy with my gyro meat, it was just as good as georges, with maybe 5 less pieces, but they dont offer eveything else these guys have so thats in their favor. im comparing them to georges because they are very close to each other and georges has the best gyro in quantity and quality hands down in the valley. So big props to posidon for standing up to my loyalties. Its unquestionable that we will be going back, especially because they have so many more greek items to choose from. Im loving the prices and want to recommend people go there to help them stay afloat. They just opened a few weeks ago, after all. The pita was warm and yummy and the spanakopita im happy to report is done right! Ive been searching for this item all over the place since I was in 7th grade in nyc and I couldnt find the right balance of spinach onions cheese and sour, and now I found it, awesome. We ordered a side of 3 pancakes for hubby to try, and for the 2.70 , we expected little pancakes. They were a full plate size and had the smell of black bear pancakes without being as overly sweet. Turns out he was too full too even eat them. I apppreciated that the garnish of orange slices on hubby and my daughters plates were actually fat and edible, instead of just props. I will say that the lettuce under the spanakopita was unecessary though. I noticed that the feta on my greek salad (which was again another item one step above georges because it had more dressing and it was romaine, not iceberg), as well as on my hot crispy slightly thicker than burger king fries, was stronger than the feta ive been having everywhere and from costco etc. I was so happy because I remember feta from ny being like this. After we finished our food, we asked the waiter about the market next door, he said look throughout and if you see something you like I'll add it on your bill.(convienient!) So we went walking and it was bulk of a lot of import items as well as some deli offerings, it felt like a foreign store or their pantry sort of. We chatted with the owner, he told us he had an import business in losangeles and he distributes to restaurants. I could see why. I asked him about the feta and he told me it was a better quality and I could buy some if I wanted. I got a two pound block for $7 added on to the bill. On the way to pay our bill, he threw in several types of olives for hubby to taste, and on the way out my daughters whining led another waitress to offer her a \"russian tea cake\" type of cookie, which was nice.

Thank you, Ashley, you were right on the mark.\n\nIt was quiet in the restaurant late Sunday morning. The dining room is open and airy, with big windows opening onto what's probably the nicest view on this strip of Main Street. The building is freshly painted in traditional Greek blue and white, and the patio looks like it'll be a great place to relax when it's not 113 degrees.\n\nThe staff was very friendly. We met what seemed to be the owners (a husband and wife couple? she handled the dining room, and he was running the kitchen), plus a nice young woman at the counter with whom I chatted for a bit. They had several more staff in the place, as I could see when I peaked through a kitchen window to see someone cleaning the already-clean (and huge) kitchen and someone else making spanakopita.\n\nThe food was great! I ordered an inexpensive meat and eggs breakfast. The sausage was good, and the potatoes (made with green pepper and red onions) were excellent, although I prefer mine more crispy. I asked for poached eggs and they made them well, though one of the eggs seemed to get away from them in the water (I hear that swirling the water and having enough vinegar fixes that, but I've never been successful making poached eggs in water, so I can't complain). The meal also came with bread, and I opted for a traditional English muffin. They matched our orders correctly, and the food was all really good. Two big breakfasts with drinks: less than $11.00!\n\nThe meal was so inexpensive and I was pretty curious about the rest of the menu, so I ordered some Greek coffee half-way through breakfast. I probably had plenty of Greek coffee when I spent a month in Athens, but that was15 years ago and I couldn't remember what to expect. In any case, it's vary similar to Turkish coffee. That is, it's a single portion made by adding finely ground coffee and sugar to boiling water (rather than hot water passed through chunkier American-style grounds). I ordered mine medium (in sweetness), and it was fantastic. I stopped drinking coffee years ago but I used to love this form of coffee; I'll definitely come back for more. Note that it is supposed to have a layer of sludge at the bottom of the cup -- don't drink it, unless you really like the taste of the grounds. They also have frappe on the menu, which is a blended, foamy, sweetened iced Nescafe-style coffee common in Greek cuisine.\n\nWe hung out at the table for a while as I had coffee and worked on some paperwork. The waitress surprised us by bringing us a small plate of baklava. It was perfectly browned and crispy on the top and sweetened well (i.e., not too much, which I like). I didn't taste the filling (I'm allergic to nuts), but Brak said it was good.\n\nThe restaurant has a shop attached (with a very cool blue piano at the entrance), so we walked around a bit. They have a variety of canned and dried goods, including an aisle of spices. The real gems in the shop are the wide variety of cheeses (including a smooth goat cheese you won't find at Whole Foods or Sprouts) and the items in the frozen case. They have at least five different varieties of phyllo dough, ready to heat gyro meat, and several sizes (from individual to family) of traditional Greek dishes that look like they were made and packaged in the restaurant. I bought a single-portion of frozen meat Moussaka (they also have vegetarian) for $5.50. \n\nI also got a small portion of hot Avgolemeno soup (cream of chicken and rice flavored with lemon) from the restaurant to take home. I certainly didn't need it after a big breakfast and baklava, but it's a wonderful traditional soup that I haven't seen in years. I tasted it, and it was delicious.

He ordered a combo meal that came with spanikopita, hummus, and tabouli (my apologies for any misspellings). It came with a side of rice and a lemon chicken soup. The spanikopita was huge, flaky and delicious. The thick lemon chicken soup had a good flavor but an odd consistency due to the egg and rice in it. I'd definitely eat it again for the flavor but my husband thinks he'd pass. I had the chicken souvlaki sandwich combo that came with fries.

He said \"Greek sounds great\", and I thought so too. So, I pulled out my trusty Yelp Android app, and we picked Posidon because of all the amazing reviews.\n\nWe were so excited to try a new place close to home, and it smelled quite good when we walked in. The waitress informed us it was her birthday, and that service might be a bit \"slow\". No worries there, that was ok with us after a long day. \n\nWe ordered spanakopita as an appetizer, he ordered a gyro with no tomatoes and french fries, and I ordered the beef souvlaki sandwitch with Greek salad. \n\nLet me preface the food review with this: I LOVE food. I love going out to eat. I'm very forgiving of mistakes, and kind when I correct them. Out of my 56 Yelp reviews, only 4 have received 1 star, and all for a very legitimate reason. I really go out of my way to give places ample opportunities to correct my frustrations, and few places are lacking in their ability to make me happy. That said, on to the food. \n\nSpanakopita: It took awhile to come out, and it was not terribly appetizing to look at. The two pieces were drastically different in size, but that wasn't the worst part. The spanakopita was luke warm/cold, tasted like it came from the frozen food aisle or had been sitting out for weeks. It was bland, not at all flaky, and the texture was really weird. Oh, and the tzatziki sauce was the worst I've ever tasted, including the months past due grocery store kind that I kept in my fridge as a poor college student. The waitress didn't bother to come back and ask how it was.\n\nGyro with fries: The meat was flavorless, cold, and smothered in tomatoes (he specifically said to leave them out) and that terrible tzatziki sauce. The fries were cold and awful. HOW do you mess up fries???\n\nBeef souvlaki with salad: The beef was tougher than shoe leather, and the leather would have had more flavor. The tzatziki (yes, I'm saying it AGAIN just to emphasize) was TERRIBLE. Oh, and the salad. If you could even call it that. It came in a bowl with a fat blob of yucky dressing, close-to-gone onions & tomatoes, with 2 olives, no feta, and lettuce that looks like it had been trampled on by a herd of zebras.\n\nWe tasted each other's dinner to double check, talked quietly, and confirmed that it was the worst dinner (I told the waitress this in an apologetic tone) we'd ever had. The plates were thrown together like they didn't care, and the service was sub par.\n\nThe WORST Part: The waitress saw us not eating, came over and asked how dinner was. I politely said it was terrible, and started listing off our grievances. Then a woman, who was apparently the \"boss lady\" came over to see what was wrong. I've never been so insulted in my life. When my bf said that the gyro meat was cold and bland, she said \"well they cut it off the rotisserie and put it on the grill\". He politely told her that he knew that's how it worked, but that it wasn't hot. She said \"Well, that doesn't make any sense. We're known for the best gyros in town, and we have 4 & 5 star reviews on Yelp\". Ok so we're totally making all this up, then. *scoff* She said \"sorry\" and walked away. No offer to replace the food, or take a portion off our bill. \n\nSo we paid $22 for food we said was terrible, with nothing but a condescending apology to walk out of the door with. FYI, we paid for our food (we regret refusing to do so), and left all but 2 bites of each dinner on the table. \n\nI'd give the place another chance if the food were the only bad thing.

I opened the sandwich and there was plenty of meat despite the sandwich being surprisingly small, aprox. 4\".  The sandwiches only come in one size so the fact that it was so small detracted from the overall value.  The bread was not good.  In parts it was soggy and in other parts it was rubbery like they microwaved it first.  I picked up the sandwich and it fell apart from being so soggy.  All the toppings fell off.  I couldn't tell which peppers were the hot ones but I suppose they were part of an odd mix of finely minced carrots, onions and cauliflower in some sort of really oily dressing that added to the soggy mess.  Not good at all.  The sausage was not very flavorful and the beef didn't taste fresh.  \n\nMy husband talked to the guy who took our order to see if I could get a fresh piece of bread in order to reassemble my sandwich.

After about six bites a piece of lettuce started to moved and then a black bug crawled out of my salad.  I screamed with fear and disgust.  My boyfriend brought the plate right over to the hostess and all she said was sorry.  Then she came over to me and said that they wash the lettuce everyday and the only reason they would have a bug infestation was because it was hot outside and people coming in.  Then she said she would make me another plate.  Ummm hello if the lettuce is only washed once a day and people have to come in and out because it's a restaurant then why would the next salad be any different?  She didn't offer to reimburse us for our food or give us a voucher to come back.  I was so disgusted by the bug and the various excuses that we won't be going back.

I was in dire need of some food in my belly. Here is my review for the Tempe location (not sure if there are others...)\n\n~Fud/Drink~\nThe Greek food is exceptional considering its in a fast-to-plate setting. Right off the bat, flavors mix well and do not taste amateurish. They have enough unique items on the menu to give the gyro-happy crowd something to cheer about, as well as the adventurous ones who wants to try the Greek Fries, etc. The daily specials actually seem to be special, with lobster on the menu as well as other fish items, it just keeps the variety going. They have a lot of drink specials throughout the week, although I haven't taken advantage of them. I prefer to slip in for a quick pita then go off on my merry way.\n\n~Atmosphere/Service~\nGood vibes come from this pita place. They get their orders out fast to you so you can enjoy, its no thrills or frills. The bathroom is dank and nasty, its pretty obvious they skimp on other things and focus directly in on the food. I want to make it clear that I do not stay, so its really not important that some things are skimped on, as long as the food is bomb...which it is :-D If I were to stay, I would definitely do so in the bar, and I would suggest the same to you. More of an environment inside if you ask me. In all, its nothing like the usual My Big Fat Greek Restaurant. Service is fast and friendly, they are courteous and mindful of your time. Once again, no thrills, just good food and service.\n\n~Extras/Rating~\nThe plates are huge here, you really do not need to push the extras with a lot of the plates...you get a ton of food. They do have a lot of extras, though. Do not consider this place a dive, it looks kinda dive-ish inside when you walk in, but just toss that misnomer aside. Great place to grub out at with some friends. I give it a 4 out of 5 star rating for its low prices, quality of food to price(s) paid, specials/happy hour menu, and fast service by people with smiles on their faces.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "This was my third time at MBFGE.

We decided on the Mediterranean chicken and a gyro picado. Each pita comes with a side (Fries, soup, salad, or rice). We chose rice and soup as ours.\n\nThe gyro meat was tender, with well balanced flavors in the pita itself. There was a lot of meat and veggies inside, which made the pita a great deal since it also included a side. I loved that they had a unique twist on the classic gyro pita, adding jalapeno to the mix to add some spicy kick. The lentil soup I had was quite good. It had the right amount of spice, and was filling and hearty. The Mediterranean chicken pita was also very good, with tender, juicy chunks of chicken. The pitas themselves were soft, slightly grilled, and came with the option of regular or wheat. I tried both types, and they were both equally good. As for the side of rice, it was well seasoned, with a nice fluffy texture.\n\nFountain drinks are free-range, and there's also a tea station with several options of tea available. Sodas are Coca-Cola brand products. \n\nThe atmosphere had a nice modern feel, very unlike other Greek places I've been to where they have a slightly outdated look, accentuated by those cheesy \"GYROS\" posters that look like they're from the '70s and '80s, of a young lady brandishing a gyro.\n\nThis restaurant is definite gem of a find through Groupon.

Reminds me of the Greek restaurants I grew up on in NY. Large portions, fresh ingredients, great color and smell that you would like to see from an \"authentic\" Greek restaurant. Say hello to Yanni and get ready to feast! \n\nIn depth review: I typically do a large take-out order once a week from Yanni's. It never fails to \"wow\" me. Small family owned business in a strip mall on the busy corner of Maryland and Silverado Ranch Blvd (around the corner from Sushi Mon). There are about a dozen tables inside and two tables outside for people who want to \"dine in.\" Take out is prompt and they can have your freshly made order ready in under 15 minutes typically. \n\nMy recommendations are as follows:\n- The Lamb Gyro plate (plates come with large portions of meat on top of rice and a generous side salad, Pita bread and Tzatzikii sauce). \n- The Chicken Gyro Plate\n- The Chicken Club Sandwich\n- Amazing Gyros (they are large)\n- Garlic Feta Fries (my favorite and quite possibly the best \"side item\" on their menu)\n- Large and fresh salads\n\nI suggest you order extra Tzatziki sauce as it's homemade and delicious. The small container they give you is never enough. Only complaint would be that the small space gets smokey as the landlord has not properly vented the space yet. They claim it is being addressed. Front doors slide open and they typically vent out the room. \n\nAlso to the person who gave them a star below and said it was frozen \"Steak-Um\" meat - you are 100% wrong. Authentic Greek restaurants use a vertical rotisserie method of cooking Greek gyro meat. They thinly shave the flavored meat and it will resemble \"Steak-Um\" meat in appearance but I can assure you it will not taste like it. Yanni's cooks right in the open and you can see what they are doing. It's delicious! \n\nThis is a solid restaurant and I have no issue giving it a 5 Star Rating on Yelp. \n\nKeep up the good work Yanni and family.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "Super fresh, and really tasty.

We had been wanting to try My Greek Corner for a while and finally got the chance! So we placed our order at the counter and were given our number to head off and get a table. The food is brought out pretty promptly which is nice.\n\nOne thing you should know about My Greek Corner is that you get a whole lotta food with your orders!  Each of us ordered a platter and got the main dish, a choice of two sides and what we came to know as a ridiculously large side-salad with our meals. That's a lot of food for lunch. Next time we know better. ;)\n\nWe ordered the hummus appetizer because what's a Greek place without hummus? The hummus was a little thin, but creamy and served with soft hot pita chips. It was adequate...nothing spectacular and lacked in garlic and other seasoning to kick up the chick pea factor. \n\nWe all selected roasted veggies for one of our side dishes and The roasted veggies are not roasted...they are steamed. They were past al-dente but not so far past that you felt geriatric. And the veggies could use a little seasoning on them--the seasoning from the fries would have been perfect. \n\nThe ridiculously oversized Greek salad wasn't really anything special. It looked nice as it had fresh crisp romaine, red onion slices and large chunks of feta, but the flavor was a bit bland. Each person got 1 kalamata olive each on our salad which we grinned about. The salad really is a meal in and of itself though and could be scaled back by almost 3/4 to really be considered a side salad. \n\nMy son had the falafel platter which came with 5 good size falafels, a side of non-roasted veggies, french fries, and a Greek Salad. The falafels were tasty and not hard as rocks like you get expect in some places. The seasoned fries were not over-salty which was nice. The salad was just too much though as it's size is a meal in and of itself.\n\nMy friend had the spanikopita platter which came with 1 spinach and 1 cheese spanikopita but hers came with 2 cheese. She chose fries and roasted veggies and along came that way oversized Greek Salad. She liked the spanikopita but wanted to try both flavors. Oh well maybe next time.\n\nMy other friend and I enjoyed the Gyro platters. She had the traditional lamb, and I had chicken. We both had rice and roasted vegetables and again that oversized Greek Salad. The rice was very bland. They made it in chicken broth so it had a yellow color to it leading you to believe it might be saffron rice...but no...it's plain white rice cooked in chicken broth. And if you are going to advertise ROASTED veggies, use the proper cooking technique.  As to the Gyros...they were tasty. The meat was thicker than you would expect which was actually a good thing. The tzatziki sauce was thick and flavorful. And again, the pitas were fresh and hot. \n\nOverall, we liked My Greek Corner. It does have a drive thru, which is funny because you definitely can't eat very many of the menu offerings in the car. With a few tweaks, this place could definitely make it in the West Valley. People complain that it might be a bit expensive, but when you consider all the food you are getting for the price, it's actually quite reasonable and you certainly don't walk away feeling hungry! I definitely wouldn't consider this a fast food restaurant and I think people are mistaking it as such because it's housed in the former building where Fazoli's was. \n\nI will definitely go back to My Greek Corner because I can't make it out to Doobie's Grill in Mesa as often as I'd like and Mike's Greek and Italian doesn't cut the mustard at all.
