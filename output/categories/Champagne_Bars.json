The ambience is upscale with jazz music playing and a stellar former-bank dome overhead.  The  salads were nice.  The onion soup was terrific. The fish we had for dinner was cooked nicely.  Overall, the meal was very nice without killer prices.

I went there for a drink with friends whilst in Edinburgh. The drinks are quite expensive so wouldn't recommend going here all night. A round of drinks for 5 people (with one diet coke) was \u00a317...not the cheapest but I  sure there are more expensive places in Edinburgh.\n\nThe main reason we went here were for the Xmas decorations. They are just spectacular. I know it is only Oct but they are a must see whilst in Edinburgh. The whole place smelled of Xmas too, gorgeous cinammon smell everywhere...not too over powerful, was just right. \n\nIt is a mixed crowd, with people of all ages in there. Everyone was really friendly and people gave us a heads up that were leaving so could get their table. The place does need more chairs and tables. There were empty tables but no chairs as people took the chairs as big crowd sitting round one table...bit annoying.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "5 stars for the BEAUTIFUL Christmas decorations! Totally got us in the mood for the holiday season! \n\n3 stars for service- it was nice, but sloowwwwww. Our waitress actually forgot to bring the tea for our \"afternoon tea\"...

Even if you just pop in to see it, see it.  It's like Christmas threw up and frankly, even for a scrooge like me, it's great.  It smells lovely, there are decorations everywhere and the tree is huge and awesome.  \n\nBut for The Dome itself?  Give it a miss.  I've not eaten here but The Man says the food is abysmal.  After a recent visit, I can however attest to the service and quality of the drinks.\n\nWe came here to soak up Christmas after a recent jaunt in the markets.  The place was, as you would expect on a Friday after work, packed.  We managed to get ourselves a perch at the bar and ordered a bottle of house wine, which was priced at \u00a324.  \u00a324 for wine which would stretch for a fiver at Tesco.  I realise we're on George St but that's ridiculous.\nThe biggest kicker was the fact that the bottle, with about 1 glass left in it, was whisked away when we weren't looking.  \nWhen we realised what happened we waved someone down who happened to be the manager.  He disappeared for several minutes to return and inform us that none of the staff *said* they took a bottle with wine left in it but he brought us two glasses as an apology.  It was a nice gesture and was appreciated, though there was something about the way he worded it that sounded as though he didn't believe us but was going to humour us anyway.  \n\nIn any case, by that point we were done being shoved around by the increasing crowds and we left for more relaxed climes.  \n\nIn short - expensive drinks, poor beer selection, heaving, and a mixture of too-eager and slightly off-putting staff.  Come for Christmas but don't expect the experience to match the decoration.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Amazing cocktails.
