A replacement was stolen from another table.  My guy's chili, a side included with his entree, lacked a depth of flavor.

I'm generally able to find vegetarian menu items at most restaurants here, but it's wonderful to have a place where I can choose anything on the menu.\n\nHence, I was excited to read in the Isthmus that The Green Owl would be opening just a few blocks from my house. I went with some friends on the second day they were open. The style of the place is great - nice colors, modern lighting (the same lights I desperately want from Century House), and clean lines - without overdoing it. My husband thought the lighting was too bright for dinner, but I wasn't bothered by that. The waitstaff was very pleasant and unobtrusive.\n\nWhen I first became a vegetarian, I was uninterested in restaurants that made vegetarian versions of traditional omnivorous meals - not that many existed in 1992... Now, however, I enjoy them quite a bit. Many of the menu items are just that: eggplant meatballs, vegan schnitzel, Italian beef sandwich, while a few are meals that just happen to be vegetarian. If I ate meat, I would think that this place would get 3 stars. It's solidly good food, but not the way some of my favorite east-coast city vegetarian restaurants amaze me and my omnivorous companions (Horizons in Philadelphia, Dirt Candy or Pukk in New York). \n\nAs a vegetarian-with-somewhat-vegan-leanings stuck in this brat and dairy land of Wisconsin, however, The Green Owl gets a secure 4-star rating. I think my Italian Beef Sandwich was one of the best things our group ordered, but I also thought the jumbalaya, schnitzel, and bbq jackfruit were excellent choices. Definitely order the kale crisps as a sandwich side - they are delicious! I can't quite figure out what spices they use on them, but they made me very happy. I agree with the last review of this place that while the pate was good, the baguette could use improvement. In general, I would argue that stepping up the breads for the sandwiches would also make a significant improvement - they're good enough, but could be better. I am a fan of the drink selection.

Best of all, The Green Owl fits the bill as a go-to spot whenever you happen to be in town---it's casual, affordable and has a good-sized menu so you can try something new each time you stop by. About 80% of the menu is vegan and all vegan items are labeled. Green Owl also has rotating vegan dessert specials daily. If you're in Madison and you're vegan or vegetarian or just like good food, this place should be at the top of your list.\n\nThe space itself is lovely: bright; colorful; retro-mod with a bistro-bar ambience. The bar up front is a bit cramped and too close to the front door (a chilly spot in winter) but it'll be great in the summer. Green Owl has a good selection of unusual wines and beers.\n\nI do wish that Green Owl was a bit more casual and offered original coffee & tea drinks, so that the space could double-up as a coffee shop as well. I think it would draw people in and (hopefully) steal away customers from less veg-friendly places in that area. It would also save me the hassle of driving a mile down the road to the Williamson Street Co-op to pick up a fresh chai for my frequent trips to/fro Minneapolis to/fro Chicago.\n\nI first time I went I had a BBQ jackfruit sandwich with roasted potatoes ($8). The sandwich tasted good on a whole, but was not without flaws. For one thing, there wasn't enough jackfruit---it seemed like only a few small pieces. Secondly, I don't know if mixing coleslaw on the sandwich worked with the smoky-sweet flavor of the barbecue sauce. Lastly, the artisan bread was not toasted enough, and was too thick; I would have preferred a thinner, toasted whole wheat option. The roasted potatoes were a tasty side, though.\n\nI also had a slice of coconut creme pie ($6) for dessert. This was spectacular. It was oh-so-subtly sweet, with wonderfully airy \"creme\" and nice crispy-crumbly notes from shaved coconut and a great crust. \n\nThe second time I went to Green Owl I had the \"vegetarian Italian beef\" (which is vegan; $9). This sandwich was excellent and tasted just like Italian beef sandwiches, though with seitan. The bread got nicely soggy and wet and brought back many memories. I think the seitan could have been marinated more in the sauce, but it was a great-tasting meal and much better than the BBQ jackfruit sandwich. I got it with a side of kale crisps, which were also awesome, and not usually seen on menus. The portion size could have been slightly larger given the price, but this was definitely a high-grade meal and well-executed.\n\nFor dessert I had a slice of New York cheesecake ($6) which came topped with strawberries, whipped cream, caramel drizzle, and one fresh mint leaf. This cheesecake was wonderful and one of the best I've ever had. It was rich, but not too sweet, and the interplay of the caramel, strawberries, mint and whipped cream was divine.\n\nOn my third visit, I had the vegan schnitzel ($13) which comes with either a soup or salad. The soup was an amazing winter vegetable medley that was quite spicy (probably too much so for most people, but just perfect for me). The schnitzel itself was also spectacular---I've never had real schnitzel, but this was a breaded, meaty marvel covered in a savory mushroom stroganoff-style sauce. I enjoyed the garlic green beans and roasted red potatoes that also came with the dish. For dessert I got a chocolate mousse tart ($6) which came with raspberry sauce and soy whipped cream; this was delicious and the chocolate had a slightly minty flavor. Green Owl consistently does excellent desserts.\n\nFor the fourth visit I had their crabby cakes sandwich ($9) which was tasty on fluffy white bread. It seemed a bit small for the price tag, but it was still good. On a whole, I would recommend the Italian beef or the schnitzel over anything else (I have yet to try their jambalaya, however). I also had a slice of key lime cheesecake ($6) which was good, and had a nicely browned/baked top layer, though it wasn't as good as the New York cheesecake I'd had a couple months back.\n\nThe service is always friendly and helpful. On at least two separate occasions my server also got me samples of the other available vegan dessert of the day, which was a great way to help me decide which dessert to choose.\n\nEvery town should have an all-purpose veg. spot like this one.

For these items, there will be color added and fake flavors.\n\nAt the Green Owl, none of those products are used. Traditional tofu and seitan are marinated and served with house made sauces and dressings. Very rich and flavorful.

I honestly can't wait to go back and try other sandwiches there.\n\nThe only 2 reasons I only gave this place 3 stars, though, are:\n\n1. Price - $9 got me the sandwich and a side salad, no drink.  When the sandwich came out, I was pretty disappointed in the size of it.  Sure enough, even with the side salad and half of the soup I split with my husband, I wasn't full after my whole meal.  They need to make these portions bigger, give you more sides, or drop their prices.\n\n2. Service - the place was only half full, and there were 3 waitresses.  Ours was nice, nothing overly friendly or rude about her, just nice.  No one seated us right away, nor was there a sign saying if we should seat ourselves or wait to be seated, so my party of 4 just stood around trying to figure out what to do for about 3 minutes before someone even noticed we were there.  Once we were seated, we had enough time to look at the menu, and our waitress took our order.  The food didn't take too long to come out, but once we did have our food, I asked for more water and my husband asked for some hot sauce.

She then came over like she knew all along with the water, didn't apologize for the wait, and filled our glasses and dropped off the bottle of hot sauce (also after my husband was nearly done with his meal).  Lastly, it took her 20 minutes (I'm not kidding) from the time we finished her meal for her to clear our plates and get our checks to us, and that doesn't include running the cards and bringing back our receipts.  \n\nBasically, this is a delicious place for extremely good vegetarian and vegan food, and I'm ecstatic that Madison has this cafe here, but in the future I think I'll just order things to go instead of suffer through 2 hours of my life trying to just eat a quick meal (with nothing to drink).", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I am very sad that the Green Owl doesn't live here in Milwaukee.

Whereas Asian cultures, all with a high level of Buddhist influence, celebrate the many variations of tofu like Westerners celebrate cheese (there is popular franchise restaurants in China featuring Buddhist cuisine; all tofu, all the time), this place is expressly trying to make vegetation derived proteins and fibers resemble meat.\n\nIn that respect, you can expect your \"sloppy joe\" or \"fish sandwich\" to undergo a bit more processing than a meat-based equivalent, to achieve the same desired goal.  Kind of analogous to how much makeup a drag queen needs to put on, in comparison to someone who is female to begin with; in our case, well the flavor just depends on if you notice the eggplant's Adam's apple or not.\n\nMoney:\nAll that vegetable makeup doesn't come cheap!  The irony is never lost on the Engineer in me that even though there's a roughly 10:1 conversion of pounds vegetation to pounds of meat, you can end up paying so much more for the vegetable \"equivalent\" (debatable, see above.).\n\nAtmosphere:\nIf you're a vegetarian or vegan, you've probably already noticed that there tends to be a bit more malnourished rhetorical bravado within your demographic (skinny hipsters).  \nYou're going to get those here.  In fact, you will probably be seated next to one, and he will probably be having a very opinionated conversation with himself (that his \"friends\" are forced to listen while they wonder why they bothered to go to dinner with this guy anyway) about why the wine this place serves isn't as baseball-glove-flavoured as another vintage.  I'm almost exaggerating, but this guy ruined my appetite more than the food ever could.\n\nDesserts:\nThese babies deserve a separate section all their own.  Thankfully many desserts may use animal-based products, but at least they don't need to feature them.  In that respect, this place really shines for desserts.  Anything off of the dessert menu can stand in its own right, and there is no noticeable flavor nor texture difference between the vegetarian and vegan offerings.  They are also tastier and more unique than many offerings I've had at slightly more \"upscale\" foodie establishments in Madison.  Hell, I think this place may receive better reviews if it just became a completely vegan dessert shopp\u00e9.\n\nDirector's Cut:\nMy opinions of this location are tempered with the fact that I was a vegetarian for two short, hungry years, and I did it out of stubbornness for my best friend, who was one for most of her life, out of sheer love for animals (took me to a county fair, made me hug a piglet, told me to think about him whenever I wanted bacon).\nIn that respect, I disliked this place, seeing its menu offerings as an affront to my stubbornness.\n\nAt the same time, stubbornness can only last so long, and this place was absolutely amazing to my bestie, who's spent much, much longer than I have walking by every other brat and burger joint Madison has to offer.\n\nSo there you have it, take a look at the menu ahead of time, try not to be disappointed by the obvious, cross your fingers that you'll be pleasantly surprised, and if all else fails, jump straight to the dessert!", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 10, "useful": 9, "cool": 7}}, {"text": "Oooooo I love this place, I drive from White water at least once a month just to eat here.

Rampart in the Smith's shopping center, Thai Style is located on a near corner of a lot.  Go slow or you might miss it because the place is tiny.  Really, there might be just over a dozen tables available for dining in.  But that's ok because Thai Style has no problems with doing take-out for you.  If you do dine in though don't worry, the place is nicely appointed!  New tables, chairs, paint.  Good ambiance, especially when it's quiet.  I hear during lunch is when the crowd is probably the biggest.\n\nCame here with the wifey for a quiet dinner one night after we heard their second location opened up here near our side of town.  Really felt like the place was our own, there were only two other tables taken nearby, and on the counter was multiple orders ready for pickup.\n\nThe menu at Thai Style is fairly authentic feeling, with some dishes looking like they may have got a bit of an American touch.  We stuck with what we were hoping was simple and basic, but had a lot of flavor.\n\nI love noodles, but really wasn't feeling Pad Thai.  We instead opted for the Pad See-Eu - stir-fried thick flat rice noodles (almost like chow fun) with egg and Chinese broccoli, all in a sweet dark soy sauce.  This was delicious.  The rice noodles with the sweet soy sauce was heavenly, and was given good texture with the addition of the Chinese broccoli.  It makes perfect leftovers, great midnight snack in front of the TV while watching Breaking Bad reruns!\n\nWe also had the Fried Chicken over Fried Rice - marinated, fried chicken breasts over a bed of Thai Jasmine fried rice.  This was good as well.  I would have liked the chicken to be a bit more flavorful, and a bit of a thicker piece.  However, it was yummy with the Thai fried rice which had egg, garlic, onion, salt, and pepper.  The rice was seasoned easily but just right.  And the portion was huge, more than enough for two people to share.\n\nWe got out of Thai Style with full bellies and some leftover change.  The bill was not bad at all, our total for two entrees, tax, and tip was under $19.  That was a plus!  We will be back to try other dishes, I really am interested in their red and yellow curries.\n\nThai Style runs some amazing lunch specials too, for short of $7 you can get a choice of TWO (yep, two) entr\u00e9e options from a pretty big list, and each lunch special comes with soup, rice, and an egg roll.

I found a coupon in my junk/coupon drawer for this place, checked the Yelp reviews, saw that each of their three locations had 4 stars, and off we went.\n\nIt's much nicer than the previous occupant, a Hawaiian barbecue joint that we went to once and hated, and I think they took over the location next door, too.  The main room has just a few tables, making you think it's all about take-out, but the adjacent room is all tables, simply decorated with painted white bamboo trees and glass tile.  Very modern, yet somehow lacking a homey feeling.  It was attractive and comfortable, though.\n\nOur server, Mica, was great, and patiently explained some new dishes we'd never experienced before.  We shared a Tom Yum soup, ordered medium; it was spicier than our usual medium experience, but delicious.  The bowl was big enough to double as a hot tub, and the chicken was very tender.  By the time we had as much liquid as our expanding stomachs could take, it was time for our main courses.  And as usual, we ordered much more than we could eat, since the portions are large.  That's a good thing, because my favorite dinner is leftovers.\n\nI don't know if Three-Flavored Salmon is served in other Thai restaurants, but it is here, and it's a wonder.  A grilled salmon fillet is buried under a blanket of ground and well-seasoned chicken, decorated with two shrimp, all nestled into a very light sauce.  This dish isn't spicy at all, just different and delicious, and served with a good-sized molded mound of perfectly-cooked jasmine rice.  And not overly salted either - yay!!\n\nKnowing the Yellow Curry Pumpkin would last at home longer than the salmon, we each had just a small taste for Yelp review purposes only.  Yum, and yum again.  This dish had a nice kick, and it was interesting to eat pumpkin in an Asian restaurant.  We'd definitely order both dishes again, and at 8.95 each, they are a steal, especially the salmon.  On the other hand, these were both so good that we're looking forward to trying some of their other dishes.\n\nOh, and that coupon?  There were two:  one for a Thai iced coffee with $15 purchase and another for an appetizer with a $25 purchase.  Though we came close to the latter's limit, I couldn't see us stuffing our faces with even more food, so I opted for the Thai coffee.  The coffee took the sting out of not finding out in advance that they didn't have wine or beer.  But with the humongous calorie count of all that condensed milk, I could've had an appetizer.  After Mica brought the coffee, which I was slurping zestily, she returned and said the coupon expired in November.   I thought it was rather new, and hadn't looked at the small print.  But then I remembered our Australia sojourn in October and November.  Jeez, time flies when you're having fun.

There was just something wrong, like old meat or oil that had me repulsed.\nThe fish itself was light and flaky inside, but the coating was a soggy mess.

Our experience was less than stellar.  But I didn't update my review then.  On the second visit, I ordered the same salmon dish I had the first time, and it was so bad I had to send it back.  The waitress tried to explain that they use frozen salmon, and yada, yada.  Its replacement was just ordinary.  The other couple were split 50-50 in their opinions of their dishes.\n\nDuring our first visit we wanted to get more information about take-out, figuring that we'd be doing that on a regular basis.  We particularly wanted to know about the soup.  Our Tom Kha was fabulous, and it was such a big bowl that we couldn't imagine we'd get that much if we had it as take-out, but the waitress assured us it was a very big container.\n\nSo on this uncharacteristically rainy night, we opted for take-out from Noodle House.  My first disappointment was taking an ordinary Chinese restaurant-type plastic container out of the bag that was only three-quarters full.  It turned out not to matter:  the soup was so unbearably spicy that we couldn't finish it.  It also had half the amount of chicken that our dine-in portion had.  \n\nFour vegetable spring rolls were decent, but very greasy.  \n\nWe ordered our main dish, Pad Thai, as a chicken-beef-shrimp combination.  It had a \"generous\" helping of two rather small shrimp, chewy and flavorless beef, and some tender chicken.  This dish is usually very bland at other Thai restaurants, but this one was very spicy.  I didn't mind that, since it didn't cause smoke to come out of my ears like the soup did.  But the noodles were rubbery, and if it had chopped peanuts, there weren't enough to taste them.  A disappointment.\n\nI guess it was too good to be true, but we'll go back to the other Thai restaurants we used to go to before our hopes were raised by the opening of Thai-Style Noodle House, which is so much closer to our home.

We've spent some pretty good time together.  I've actually eaten here a few times but usually I get delivery to my job.\n\nThe pad see ew is absolutely delicious - the flat noodles are nice and well-cooked, tossed with a delicious sauce, chicken and plenty of vegetables (but not too many that you feel like you're getting stiffed).\n\nThe red curry I had when I was super-congested - I believe I ordered a 5 or a 6 (their spicy scale is 1-10) - and not only was it, too, tasty, but it also allowed me to breathe with its well-placed spiciness.\n\nThe pad thai is good and reminiscent of the pad se ew but I felt it lacked a little flavor as I really enjoy that in-your-face peanut sauce that, to me, is a staple of the pad thai dish.  It had a hint of a lemon flavor, which is the biggest reason I dislike the pad thai from Le Thai, but it wasn't enough to completely turn me off to the dish.  Or maybe I was starving that day.  I don't know, but it was gone pretty fast.\n\nEach time there's certainly been enough for two meals (I just happened to really be hungry on the pad thai day) and the prices are quite reasonable.

The food is pretty much the same at all locations with the two outside of Chinatown being newer and cleaner in appearance.  Thai Style is my favorite Thai spot outside of the pricier Lotus of Siam.  I think the options are a better value than say Archie's for the typical Thai fare, with some options you might not see at some of the more generic Thai restaurants. Some of my favorite dishes are the beef/pork jerky with this amazing sweet/salty/sour dipping sauce.  The Moo Tod (fried pork) over fried rice is also delicious, with the pork being fried with a hint of sweetness.  The pork comes over a heaping portion of fried rice.  It also comes with a bland soup...which I generally don't partake in...but I'm told it's a palette cleanser.   My new favorite find has been the Three Companion Pork, which comes with sticky rice, papaya salad, and either pork or chicken.  The papaya salad here is a refreshing option for the Las Vegas summer heat.  It's a blend of green papaya, tomatoes, green beans, and carrots sprinkled with peanuts.  It's a bit spicy even when I ordered it at a level 2 out of 10.  My nose was getting runny while eating it, but I kept going back for more until the dish was empty.  I like that Thai Style also offers duck as an option instead of just chicken/beef/pork.  The duck fried rice and duck pad see ew are delicious.  In the wintertime, I also enjoy the beef noodle soup.  The broth is a dark, thick broth with a variety of beef cuts and beef meat balls.

For the price the soups are a good value but everything else isn't because I don't feel that it's edible. The meats are always a weird texture, almost like they used canned meat or something like in the garlic pepper chicken, ginger chicken, even the fried chicken which has rave reviews was a weird orange and also soggy. How do you serve soggy fried chicken?? I've had more entrees and also ones with beef which weren't to my liking. The only things I have liked didn't have meat in them or had tofu. I'll still come here for the soups and basil fried rice, but nothing else.\n\nUPDATE:\nI ate here again with a friend and had the lunch special.

I received some random mixed veggie salad on the side and two pieces of fruit, as well as some orange paste for the \"fries.\" Being completely honest, I couldn't even identify what was on my plate with the exception of the two pieces of fruit. I really tried to be open-minded and started to eat what was on my plate but everything tasted \"off.\" Not a thing on my plate was edible. The flavors that were there were so strange, peculiar, and really hard to describe. I just know that they were terrible. I couldn't eat more than 4 bites before I had had enough. And trust me - this morning I was STARVING and I would much rather prefer to starve than eat here again.\n\nMaybe I'm the crazy one, but I don't think that an oven is necessarily a bad thing. Maybe Matt and I both ordered the wrong thing or should have ordered a (ridiculously priced) smoothie, but I can't believe that anyone in their right mind thinks that what was on my plate was flavorful and tasty. I can't believe I spent $13.88 on a plate of vegetable mush. As a vegan I'm used to eating new things that might not work in theory but this just did not work at all, and at least those questionable items were still edible and identifiable. I was so angry that I just cried instead upon leaving Go Raw and I know for a fact I will never be back.", "review_stars": 1, "review_votes": {"funny": 7, "useful": 8, "cool": 4}}, {"text": "Let me start by saying I that I sometimes choose to eat a vegetarian diet.  I sometimes consume meat, but try to keep it to a minimum, strictly because it's a healthier way to live -- not from any moral considerations.  When I do eat meat I try to avoid, if possible, meat that has been tainted with nitrates, antibiotics, and hormones.  I wish there were more restaurants in Las Vegas that catered specifically to vegans and vegetarians.  Many restaurants offer vegan and vegetarian options, but my Internet search turned up only one restaurant in town that does not serve meat at all -- the Go Raw Cafe.\n\nAfter greatly enjoying a vegetarian Thanksgiving with Tofurkey bought from Whole Foods, I wanted to continue my meatless streak at the Go Raw Cafe.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was a flyer that had been placed on every table advertising pressure acupuncture.  There was also a bulletin board and counter near the entrance covered with business cards and other flyers.  I wasn't wearing my glasses, but squinting I could make out that one of the flyers was promoting the healing power of crystals.  There was also a book nook that I browsed briefly while waiting for my order to arrive.  One book was all about The Lemonade Diet.  You get the gist.  Why is it that so many natural/health food restaurants and markets are in bed with pseudo-science, Eastern culture, and New Age mysticism? \n\nPerhaps it's the health food crowd's general mistrust of mainstream culture that results in a gratuitous openness to anything that seems to be a counter-culture alternative to the mainstream.  The irony is that whether the pedlar is selling cheese burgers, snake oil, or scientifically-unsound books touting fad diets, the profit-motive remains the same.  It is the stealthy hand of corporate culture that tries to tempt the health food crowd with non-mainstream offerings.  I think there must be marketing research which suggests that health food advocates are susceptible to buying anything that appears to be outside of mainstream culture, as long as it makes attractive claims to improve our physical and spiritual health.  It's pretty insulting, if you ask me.\n\nBut none of that is a critique of the Go Raw Cafe.  Just an observation.  On to the dining experience.\n\nOur waiter started by asking my dining partner and me if we had been there before.  When learning that we had not, he provided us with some luke-warm recommendations of a couple of things that he liked all right, and warned us about some other things that he didn't care for, but which some people apparently do like.  It almost seemed as if he were apologizing in advance for the menu.  Seeing as the Smoothies and Veggie Juices were in the range of $6 to $9 each, we just ordered a couple of waters with lemon to start with.  The tepid waiter brought our waters in small plastic glasses without ice.  My dining partner's lemon wedge was all skin and no pulp. \n\nWe decided to split the International Sampler and a half-order of the vegi-cotti.  I was looking forward to the hummus and garlic bread sticks that were part of the International Sampler.  But when our food arrived, I couldn't see or taste any hummus anywhere.  Maybe it was inside of the Mexi Wrap, or mixed in with the Pasta?  As for the garlic bread sticks, there were four of them, stuck upright into the pasta.  They were about the length of a finger with only half the girth.  They were crisp, barely flavored, and gone in six bites.\n\nThe pasta primavera that came with the vegi-cotti looked almost identical to the pasta that came with the International Sampler, but there was a very subtle difference in taste.  The taste of the food was unusual, but not unpleasant.  It was interesting, but not exciting.  \n\nI never had any hesitation or reluctance about eating the food because I knew it was healthy and wholesome.  But I eat healthy, wholesome meals all the time without having to sacrifice good taste and delicious flavors. One can eat healthy and also enjoy it. This food was merely edible.  It didn't taste like shit.  It wasn't repulsive.  But this is not high praise. \n\nThe menu was also overpriced given the moderate serving portions.  You don't get a lot of food for the price you pay.  Our meal came to $26, and we had no leftovers. \n\nThe best I can say about the Go Raw Cafe is that it serves healthy, edible food.

My husband and I entered the small cosy restaurant right next to the lake (sounds quaint and nice but the lake is actually pretty smelly) and we were surprised to see 4 tables (out of a total of about 7) with people. On a Tueday night. Vegas. Raw food place. Yes..I was intrigued. As we were having dinner, a few more tables got filled.\n\nThere was one waitress for the entire place. A very sweet young lady who was knowledgeable about the food and had some very good suggestions. \n\nOur order:\n\n1. We ordered the only cooked item in the store : their hot soup ($5.80 for a bowl). This was a simple blend of multiple vegetables in a thick stock with spices. We literally licked our bowls clean\n\n2. Cheeseburger with \"fries\" (about $10.50) - the burger patty is made out of beets, various vegetables and grains and was presented in between 2 pieces of sprouted bread, tomatoes, onions, homemade ketchup/mustard and of course a generous helping of fresh avocado and almond \"cheese\". I was floored at how flavorful the burger was. It was one of the top 5 veggie burgers I've had in my life. When the ingredients are presented to you on a Yelp review, they do not look appetizing. In fact, the burger itself looked pretty bad. But the food is mighty mighty tasty. The burger came with their raw fries. I'm not sure what they were made of (I think avocado and some breading) but these were pretty bad. I'd skip this next time\n\n3. The \"Manicotti.:\" I got the half order that was $8.88. If I were Chinese, this would be my lucky meal! I have to rave about the side \"pasta salad.\" This was made with slivered zuchinni/squash and various different veggetables and had such robust flavors of spices and garlic and marinara all over it. I didn't even miss not having spaghetti. This was just the best alternative to pasta I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. The Manicotti itself was also pretty good. \n\nOur meal came up to just under 30 dollars.\n\nI regret being so close-minded to not try this gem in Las Vegas nestled away in the Lakes area. To have the opportunity to eat clean, absolutely unprocessed food is hard to come by anywhere and although I don't believe I could follow this lifestyle (as unintrusive to nature as it may be) on a full-time basis, I think it does wonders to partake in a meal like this ever so often.

It is nestled right off the \"lake\" and you can admire many a large house from the seats inside. We arrived at about 11am, and the place was pretty quiet.

My first reaction to the sampler was how big it was. It is pricey for sure, but the I really expected the portions to be smaller after reading other Yelper reviews. Everything on the sampler was delicious. The hummus is the best I've ever had. I don't like runny hummus, and this is not. It has little chunks of chickpeas, has a nice strong garlic taste and the raw tahini flavor is nutty but not overpowering. I could have eaten a pound of the stuff. The Mexi-cali wraps were very flavorful and fresh. The guacamole was incredible. However, my favorite was the pasta. I don't like zucchini, but the pasta was so delicious. The sauce was beyond words. I wish I had bottles of the stuff. It was like a marinara salsa but was so full of flavor. \n\nThe veggie sushi was also delicious. It was jam packed with fresh veggies and some sort of flavorful paste. The seaweed was a bit chewy, but other than that it was very good. The ginger sauce was also very strong, but not overpowering. \n\nThe chocolate cheesecake was not made in house, but was good. It was a bit grainy, but tasted like cheese cake.

I witnessed the juice chef chop open a fresh young coconut for the juice in my smoothie, and collect a bunch of other fresh ingredients that he skillfully threw together into the blender to make my delicious bev. All good stuff, no nonsense fillers such as sugary juices and ice. Because there was no ice or anything like that, my smoothie came out a bit warmer than I expected a smoothie to be.

Please forgive me.\n\nSo, I must first state that I am not a vegetarian or vegan, but I am an open minded person ESPECIALLY when it comes to food. I frequently visit vegetarian/vegan-friendly restaurants--My favorite being VeggieGrill in LA. Today, my vegetarian friend and I decide to make a trip to Go Raw Cafe because 1. My friend is a vegetarian and we typically cater to his preference when dining and 2. It is Ash Wednesday when Catholics observe by not consuming meat. \n\nWe arrive at Go Raw Cafe pretty excited being that it was our first time. We even mention this to the woman behind the counter who didn't receive our enthusiasm as we thought. She simply tells us to take a seat at the tables and she'd be there shortly. To her, \"shortly\"  meant ten minutes.\n\nWe politely asked the waitress what she would recommend. We went with a few of her recommendations and ordered the Mexicali Pizza, the Neat Loaf and \"Fries,\" and a Tropical Smoothie. We were also served two glasses of water with about one ice cube in each glass. We asked for more ice which never came. \n\nSo... our food arrived. As soon as it was placed in front of us, we were somewhat satisfied. Presentation was pretty decent. The Mexicali Pizza looked very well put together, the Neat Loaf and \"Fries\" looked \"interesting\" and the smoothie was well, not worth the couple cents shy of $7.00. It was about the size of a small in most places. \n\nOnto the taste. The Mexicali Pizza tasted how it looked--decent. The buckwheat crust was just not what I imagined it to be. It was about the consistency of what you would imagine biting into a dog biscuit would be like. The toppings tasted very similar to a 7 layer dip which wasn't bad. The Neat Loaf was in my opinion, disgusting. We knew the second we took our fork to it, it wasn't going to be a great experience. The consistency was like that of poop. Kind of looked like it too to be honest. The \"fries\" were what I believe to be breaded avocados. I have never wanted to endulge in the greasy goodness of REAL fries ever in my life until after biting into those things.  \n\nI honestly try to make the best of every moment, and my friend and I were willing to order something else off the menu. When they waitress came, my friend had told her the Neat Loaf was not what it imagined it to be and asked about another item on the menu. I'm sure she took this as an insult, and she disregarded his question about the other item and asked \"do you want to box it up?\" My friend replied, \"Um, no, I don't think we're going to eat it later.\" She then says, \"then give it to your parents.\" Puzzled, he says, \"Um. No.\" Turned off and no longer interested in ordering something else, my friend reminds her of the ice she never brought us and she comes back with it ten minutes later. \n\nAfter all that, I asked for the check, paid the $40.00 tab (in which I did leave a tip that my friend said I shouldn't have based on our poor service), and we left in search of something to eat. We wished we had just gone to Yardhouse for their Gardein items.  \n\nI do not plan to return to Go Raw Cafe... Or maybe I shall call it \"NO Raw Cafe.\"\n\nNote: It is obvious that Go Raw Cafe caters mainly to their \"regulars.\" Sitting there for the time that we did, it was clear that we were not treated like their \"regular\" patrons were and not only felt ignored, but felt unwelcomed.

The place has a nice vibe, is clean and cheerfully decorated.  I perused their selection of supplements and also the raw foods available for purchase to take home while waiting for our order to come up.  (They also have a fairly large selection of books but I did not have a chance to look at those.)\n\nThe food was pretty good and it did come out quickly but the service left a lot to be desired.  There was neither silverware nor napkins at any of the tables--not a big deal but our server did not bring any out for us even once we were seated although she did bring us glasses of water with lemon slices.  \n\nWe decided to order the flax crackers with guacamole and salsa and share it as an appetizer.  The food arrived pretty soon after with some brightly colored melamine plates but--still no napkins or silverware, which was a bummer since of course chips 'n' salsa can be a bit messy.  The chips were crispy and had a good flavor and the salsa and guac were obviously fresh and brightly colored.  The guac had a good consistency with little bits of veggies in it and the salsa was chunky.  (We could have used a few more chips though.)\n\nMy father ordered a small salad and the cooked item of the day--a curried soup.  Mom ordered a portabello wrap, sis had the purple burrito with mex pate and I decided to try the mock salmon cakes.  Everything looked great and was beautifully presented on colorful dishes.  Our waitress did eventually bring us napkins and silver but she just plopped down four settings at the side of the table rather than handing them to us.  She never did take away our menus after we'd ordered so I finally moved them to an adjacent table.  I don't think she ever checked back with us to make sure our food was OK but she did eventually come back to refill our water glasses.  (The place was not busy, either--I think there was just one other customer there at the same time that we were.) \n\nI have to say I was disappointed with the \"salmon\"--perhaps I should have gone with my other choice which was the \"neat loaf.\"  The rest of my family seemed to enjoy their food well enough though. \n\nWe had a somewhat tight schedule so I'd inquired early on if their desserts could be ordered \"to go.\"  Our waitress said that they could; she said she would find out what the day's selections were and let us know what they had.  She said she thought they had \"pies\" but she never did get back to us on that.  At the end of our meal I got up myself , went to the kitchen and inquired about desserts which, as it turned out, did NOT include any pies.  They had several flavors of individually packaged cheesecakes, some commercial chocolate bars, and something billed as \"fudge\" that looked mostly like chunks of chocolate-tinged granola.\n\nWe decided to take three cheesecakes and some \"fudge\" to go.  As soon as we'd gotten up from the table our waitress came out to clear the table and as we were on our way out the door she thanked us for coming.  The cheesecakes were quite tasty.  The \"fudge\" was not bad but I really think it should be called something else--it really is nothing like fudge.  It has nuts, seeds, honey, and some cocoa in it but not particularly fudgey.\n\nOverall I would probably go there again to try some of the other items on the menu but I am interested in raw foods to begin with.  I don't know if my family liked the place well enough to want to go back.  The Go Raw Cafe gets points from me for the wide variety of menu selections, pleasing food presentation, and the speed in which we were served.

The food was really filling as others have mentioned so small portions are just what you need.\n\nDuring the meal, Bob mentioned that he felt like his sinuses were stopping up and we chalked it up to hayfever. We bought a few packaged things from the store to go. On the way back to the hotel, Bob macked on some cinnamon & raisin \"tortillas\" that smelled great but tasted like sand.  The really bad news is that Bob rediscovered a flaxseed allergy that he had only experienced once 10 years ago and had forgotten about,  that within 30 minutes had closed up his throat and made his neck swell up like he was storing nuts for the winter. A trip to the ER and 5.5 hours later, Bob was on the mend from various injections and IV drips (food allergies are nothing to f with as you may know) and we spent another hour finding a CVS pharm that was open and getting prescriptions filled.

We all loved all three plates, although my son didn't like the crust of the pizza.  It's raw vegan flatbread, and even though my husband and I loved it because it has a wonderful nutty flavor that compliments  the fresh toppings, my son prefers a  traditional pizza crust..

Firstly, we couldnt find the place, as there is no banner that says Go-Raw. They have large signs that say VEGAN! Now, I figured out that there is no way there would be 2 vegan cafes in a strip mall - so we went in, turns out it was the place. It is certainly surprising \nthat there is one such place in Vegas - which is the town of buffets, steak, sinful food and wastage. \n\nAmbiance: it was somewhat boring. Looked more like a homeopathic clinic or bookstore than a lunch place. The lighting was un-flattering, furniture was boring, decor was average. \nFood - Certainly a lot of variety - but perhaps that is the problem here. They had american, Mexican, Italian  and Mediterranean dishes and it is really difficult to come up with so many good combinations, especially if you are planning to Go RAW!  I am comparing with other organic, vegan and raw places, so I am setting my expectations right. I tried the lasagna, and it was horrible. They told me the pasta was made out of Zucchini, I thought it would be something cool and unique - to my disappointment, zucchini was the pasta. The sauce was average and so was the salad. We also tried their beet burger, but the bread (which must have been made out of almond meal or something) was really dry and chewy. The Mediterranean platter has some kind of wraps made of collard greens (sucked), hummus and a cold salad. The hummus tasted, but again - I've had better. \n\nThe portions are really huge and so are the prices. When you are eating raw food, the truth is that you wont eat a whole lot - the food energizes you quickly and is leafy and cold so you just dont over-eat. It is a good thing, but its also not food that you want to take away and eat later when it is colder and stale. This place needs to really reduce the amount of dishes on the menu, focus on few good salads and sandwiches and make them really well and tasty. \nService - The waitress didn't seem to care that much, kinda typical vegas attitude.

The chef told me that not only was it vegan, but she makes it herself.  She was explaining how she couldn't make it some days if the weather wasn't cooperative, and so on and so forth.  In any case, it was SO good.  I told her she could easily sell it commercially; she smiled and said she could never make enough at once to make it commercially.  Damn shame.  She'd be a bazillionaire.  And that's just from the amount I'd buy from her.  \n\nOh, and did I mention that the fries were baked?  They did not taste baked.

Despite its very bland description, there are so many complements it deserves! First of all, you know when you're eating a wrap & its hard to take bites without pieces of lettuce, meat, or other veggies escaping because they are too long? How about chopped lettuce (no yucky iceberg pieces) mixed with cheese, lightly covered in ranch & cubed grilled chicken tossed in buffalo sauce- all cozy in a wheat wrap. Very easy to eat, without excess food particles falling out! I also loved the fact that it was served with baked chips.

The chicken panini was bland and I couldn't taste any of the pesto that was supposed to be in the sandwich. The other sandwich was decent. Both came with a side salad with a tasty vinaigrette dressing.\n\nWhile the sandwiches were solid, if unspectacular, the best reason to visit Red Velvet Cafe is to taste their red velvet cake.

Turns out it's a Pizza.....come on, enough with the goofy names already, just call it a Pizza and call it a day!  A lot of stuff looked good and I was surprised at the number of items available for Carnivores....I ended up ordering their Fire Fries (Baked Fries topped with Hot Sauce, Pico de Gallo, Mozzarella & Cheddar Cheese $7) and a Chicken Panini (w/Buffalo Mozzarella, Tomato, Basil with Pesto $7.95).  The server asked if I wanted the Vegan Cheese on the Fire Fries....I passed and wanted the full monty.\n\nTo wash it down, I had some Iced Tea ($2.50)....which was awesome BTW.\n\nThe service was a bit slow.  It took some time for the waiter to take our order and the table next to us had to stop a busperson to get their order taken too.  It was 11:30 am and the lunch rush hadn't started yet, so I don't know what the issue was.  Anyway, it wasn't too bad but was borderline annoying.....another few minutes and it would have cost them a Star.\n\nOur food came out after a short wait and I was surprised to see how HUGE the Fire Fries were!  I thought this was suppose to be a \"healthy\" restaurant?!  LOL  For a minute I thought I was in Claim Jumper!  The Fries look too good, so I attacked them first.  The top layer of Fire Fries were awesome....baked well and had good flavor.  However.....the middle and bottom portion of the Fries were undercooked and semi-raw, not good.  Also, the cook didn't spread the ingredients throughout the dish.....the Hot Sauce and Pico de Gallo was only in one corner of the dish, buried under the top layer of Cheese.  The other 3/4 of the dish was only melted Cheese and the Fries.  This was a damn shame because the portion with all of the ingredients was awesome!  The rest of it was just so/so.  He/she needs a lesson in making a consistent dish.\n\nThe Chicken Panini was next.....after I took one bite I realized I made a big mistake.  The combination of Fire Fries and the Chicken Panini wasn't good.  The sharp, spicy flavor of the Fire Fries overwhelmed my taste buds so when I ate my Chicken Panini it tasted bland.  This is not the restaurant's fault, but mine.  So my review of the Panini is incomplete.  The side Salad with Balsamic Vinaigrette was awesome though.  \n\nAnother note....the Panini came with Whole Grain Bread as a default....I wasn't given an option for any other type of Bread, but saw other people with Panini's with what appeared to be White Bread....wish I had the choice.\n\nOverall, this place has a lot of potential.  That's what made it so difficult for me to rate it....the 1/4 of the Fries that had all of the ingredients and were cooked thoroughly tasted awesome but the raw Potatoes in the middle was a turn off.

They were terrible, too much cheese and soggy/drenched in tabasco (or some sort of thin liquidy hot sauce). I got a zucchini and veg chick'n dish that was entirely too bland. I asked our waiter if I could get some soy sauce and he never came back. My boyfriend got the ham and cheese panini, neither of us liked it either. \n\nWhen we were getting ready to leave we asked a woman standing behind the dessert display case if we could get the last apple pie (they were mini) to go. She then informed our waiter that we wanted an apple pie and we saw him carry it away, knowing that he was going to heat it up and put it on a plate. Surely, he did just that. So we had to tell him that it was TO GO, so he transferred it into a plastic container (PAY ATTENTION) and we left. \n\nNo one checked up on us, the waiter was annoying, none of the employees communicated to each other while we were there, the food was gross, the atmosphere was off and it was too expensive.

I was visiting Vegas just last week and on our second to last day there we had google searched vegan friendly restaurants in the area and came up with the Red Velvet. We went based on the good reviews of the food to try out our luck and were pleasantly surprised. The food was in fact absolutely amazing. I have never had a vegan dish that was that health consciously filling. The desserts were something to die for and I couldn't believe that the cakes were all under 200 calories AND vegan. NOW, HERE'S THE PROBLEM.... I would've loved to been able to write that and end it on a happy note however an issue occurred that was VERY off-putting for me as a customer. The very next day we found and ate at the Red Velvet we went back to grab food to go for our trip back home, I had also bought almost $100 worth of cakes to take back to my friends and family to try (some vegans some not), you know, to wow them with the news of the good food. I am not the kind of person to excessively worry about how well people are doing their jobs because with how many encounters we have with other businesses as consumers today, that's just too much worry. With that being said, I guess my fault was in the fact that I didn't check our bags to make sure everything was in there. I had only realized that when we got home 2 days later. When I called the restaurant and spoke with the manager he told me he'd look into it and get back to me. Now normally, I would take that as \"you're bugging me, I don't have time for this sh*t, so I'll pretend I care to get you off the phone.\" But because I had such an initial pleasant experience there, I assumed for the best. Not getting a phone call back, I called back the next day and spoke with the manager again who told me their \"records and inventory\" match and they didn't have any extra food left. I told him I understood but I had basically paid $13 (6.50 each cake) for something I didn't even receive, and continued to ask him how he planned on rectifying this. Longer story short, this manager who originally came off as if he gave a crap basically told me I'm not gonna do the right thing which would have been to just refund me my money and move on. Instead he kept stuttering and ended up hanging up on me.\n\n\nNow I'm not sure what day and age this man got his so-called \"business experience\" through or at, but a word to the wise when you go here for anything. Check your food be it to-go or ordering in and make sure you're gonna eat the food you order because chances are if this  guy did this to me for a simple to-go order he'll be a tight ass even if you found a dead rat under your panini, or simply didn't like the food. Most restaurants are smart enough to hold onto customers, NOT PUSH THEM AWAY! Especially the enthusiastic ones who like me live in another state and are your marketing tools! Word of mouth is a very powerful thing now a days, but that doesn't just go for the positive things people have to say about businesses like this, it goes for the NEGATIVE AS WELL!!!", "review_stars": 1, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Came for lunch with Elnino F. and Angela H. I'm down for healthy eating so I've been curious to give this spot a try. \n\nI ordered the Chicken Hummus Wrappini ($9.99) with the vegan \"chicken\" (I was curious!) and regular mozzarella cheese. It also had lettuce and tomato in a chipotle tortilla. The \"chicken\" and hummus part was decent, however there was a huge amount of lettuce in there in comparison to chicken, hummus or cheese and for $10, I was hoping I could get at least a even spread of topping and not get a bunch of cheap filler iceburg lettuce. At least pour on the hummus for some nice flavor in it but it was sparse and not evenly spread. After I ate the spot with the hummus it was bland and dry....It was frustrating to get a bite of promise of something good and then bite into bleak nothingness. It comes with a side and I chose salad. What I found odd was that my lettuce didn't look dressed so I moved it around and saw a few leaves were, but not enough to say it was \"dressed\". It's like they dressed one salad for someone, had a few left and poured it onto my plate and then forgot to dress up another batch and just threw it on my plate. I got vinaigrette after asking but sparse dressing, sparse hummus- is this supposed to make it uber healthy to not add so much sauce or are they just sauce nazis? Give me flavor! No flavor is unhealthy to my state of being! \n\nI traded a half wrap with Elnino and since his buffalo wrap came with a side sauce, it was better since I can pour on some flavor. \n\nI heard though desserts were shining. I know Red Velvet is the namesake, but since Elnino got that, I decided to get a comfort favorite of mine- chocolate chip banana bread pudding ($6.50). I was really curious how this was gonna be moist and tasty without the milk aspect of most puddings. At first it kinda tasted like it had some rum in it which was odd, but it was doable. Then I got to a banana chunk and stopped eating- the rummy flavor was made because the banana had gone bad and fermented my cake. \n\nElninos warm red velvet was surprisingly good and the service was fairly nice and kept with the ice tea, but I left disappointed. I had a bit of a hope a good spot for veggies exist and after thinking about it this weekend and thinking of all the glowing things people have said to me, I'm rather upset to have paid $24 for that. That can get 2 delicious vegan entrees at my favorite Thai spot around town. \n\nI'm far from being a vegetarian but I know good flavorful food and this didn't make me want more. I'm from LA and I loved the vegetarian fare at a lot of the vegan spots about town. I loved it that I was a regular at Real Food Daily because it was creative and tasty. I was hoping and wishing that RVC  be my no brainer healthy meal spot but not even sure I want to go back- ever.\n\nI can't give it more than a 2 when taste and value isn't present and makes me wonder how long they let pastries sit around if bananas were allowed to go rank. \n\nMaybe if you're vegan and don't have much food choices then this place would be okay to go to but I think you're better off going to a vegan friendly Asian place or getting sandwiches from Whole Foods.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 6, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "When I lived in Summerlin I use to go here after hiking at Red Rock on the weekends.

Don't expect the texture of fried fries.\nThe fries were quite uneven in the way that they were cut, so some of them were overcooked, others were undercooked. This is easily remedied when the fries are cut evenly.\n\n+ The taco salad was very good. Very big and very filling. My husband ate half-ish of it at lunch and my son finished it for an after-pool snack. Everyone liked it a lot.\n\n+ The portion of guacamole is enormous and the guacamole is quite good. They don't give you enough chips, though.\n\n+ I had a chicken, spinach, mushroom paninni, which was very very very good. Even as take-out it was warm and melty and yummy.

My galpal and I ordered chicken provolone panini which came with a side of either salad or chips. We sticked with the greens. In a while, our dishes came in a big serving plate and mind you, the salad sauce was really good - balsamic vinegar and olive oil (at least that's what my friend said it was) $7.95 for an order that big is verrrry reasonable. \n\nATMOSPHERE: The atmosphere was contemporary and club music was playing in the pipe-ins. We were expecting a more ambient vibe. RVC felt more like a restaurant than a cafe seeing as we actually had waiters - It should practically be called Red Velvet restaurant. \n\nSERVICE: It could really do with more impovement on this part. When we got in, we sat down on some tables like we'd always do at a cafe. There were no barristas, some of the customers seemed to have a menu but we weren't given one so I went up to the food counter and asked for a menu. Our waiter seemed a bit hesitant, we'd think he's new but as far as recommending food selections or anything, we didn't get any. \n\nIn the end, go there for the food. Don't expect to be able to read a book, bring in a laptop or do your homework at RVC's settings which encourages a more social atmosphere.

(please, take a seat)\n\nLet me start off with the obligatory \"I'm not a vegetarian/vegan\" statement that I think should accompany reviews of places that cater to these unfortunate souls (kidding!)\n\nBeen here thrice.  First time was a year and a half ago or so, and I tried the Chicken, Artichoke and Spinach Panini with Vegan cheese (I'm lactose intolerant :( ).   This was my first time trying Vegan cheese.    What do they say about the first time?  Awkward?  Painful?  \"They\" were right.   I have successfully avoided vegan cheese since, and though the rest of the ingredients were fine, I avoided RVC in a \"guilt by association\" sort of reasoning.\n\nFinally getting the courage to go back, I tried their Taco Salad last week based on all the positive Yelp reviews it seems to garner.   Well I'm happy to say they are much deserved.  First, it's HUGE.  I only ate half and am convinced it could successfully feed a family of vegans for a week.   The baked(?) taco shell was the highlight, and within it contained a ton of rice, lettuce, chunks of chicken (vegans can substitute for a lot of of non-meat meats), and salsa (no cheese for me, vegan or otherwise).  I thought the taste of all the ingredients was spot on and I definitely didn't walk away hungry.  \n\nWent there again for lunch today and went with the Chicken Burger (hold the cheese) with Baked Fries.    I'm officially in love with this place (statute of limitations on Vegan Cheese infractions has run out).   The Chicken Burger was almost exactly like the Chicken Sandwiches you can get at Wendys, McDonalds, etc except that it actually had flavor and was made with fresh ingredients.   The Baked Fries still had the same great taste of fried french fries and to me the texture wasn't off-putting in the least.   For $7.95 I thought the meal was a steal.\n\nAll three of these experiences were getting take-out for lunch, and the service was friendly enough and I've never had to wait more than a few minutes before my food was ready (they usually say 20 minutes when I call it in and I do as I'm told).  \n\nI was close to giving this place 5 stars based on the last two experiences, but I think I just spontaneously decided to reserve 5 star reviews for places that provide me with a life altering experience (and places that have never served me Vegan Cheese)", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 2, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "I was really looking forward to eat at this place, I order tuna wrap to go.

I never write reviews but I must say I was appalled when the last time I went in to order my red velvet cupcake, I saw them put the plastic container with the cake into the microwave. Plastic #6, the most toxic and extremely dangerous to heat in the microwave. I am 7 months pregnant. Other than being INCREDIBLY carcinogenic,  this method of heating food is potentially harmful to developing fetuses. I had been going in 3 x's per week for the last month and a half or so, to satisfy my one pregnancy craving: SWEETS.  Also, I had asked prior to make sure they did not heat the cake in plastic and I was told \"no\". We had also asked the owner what was in the red velvet cake (or at least what was not in the cake), being that certain sweeteners are contraindicated in pregnancy. We were told she could not disclose specific ingredients and the employees told us conflicting things regarding what was not in the cake, so we were already leery. The cake did taste pretty good for being \"low calorie\" so I am bummed I won't be able to enjoy it anymore. It's a lot of trouble for a cake, yes, but where the problem lies is all of the health claims are obliterated by the toxic and carcinogenic result of microwaving it in dangerous plastic.

YUM!)\n\nEntrees run about $7, for a healthy-sized serving of homemade, mostly organic food.  (Read: you will be pleasantly full, but not stuffed.)  I think this service would be great for vegans who were staying on the strip and had a microwave and fridge/freezer in their room.  Or anyone really.  Eating out healthy in Vegas isn't necessarily an easy thing, especially for vegans and vegetarians who are visiting! This food is tasty and filling without having the overbearing fat and salt of restaurant food.\n\nMy dishes took about 10 min to heat up in my home and work microwaves except for the lasagna which took about 30 min in my oven.  I really liked everything except for the lasagna; it was very filling but pretty bland, overwhelmed by whole wheat noodles.  The peanut noodles were delish - probably my fave- but the mac n cheez was damn good too.  I would order the noodles, mac, curry, and dumplings again for sure! \n\nThe ginger pear bread was perfect- great banana bread-like texture, just sweet enough, with delicious chunks of pear! My dog agreed with me, as she stole half of it off my kitchen table! (and yes, I ate the rest, it was that good.)\n\nThey are now offering Holiday baskets that sound like a great deal: bread, cupcakes, cookies, and candy (hello, vegan peanut butter cups!!) for only $25.  Someone on my holiday list is definitely getting one of these, and I might have to get one for myself.\n\nI highly recommend trying them out! There is a $5 delivery charge, so I would suggest ordering lots of stuff to make it worth your while.  They keep in the freezer for over a month, so you'll have time to use it up.

I like other good groups, like dairy or carbohydrates. But if I went into a restaurant free of them, I think I could probably manage for one meal without getting too upset. I feel like because people notice it is veggie, for some reason they have a predisposition toward seeing this as the sole reason for its faults. So I think maybe people need to realise a vegetarian restaurant can be crap for reasons other than its lacking animal.\n\nAs its stands I don't think David Bann is crap (the restaurant, not the man, he might be crap for all I know). There are plenty of vegetarian restaurants I don't like regardless of being veggie, but I do like Bann. My first and only gripe really is that its a touch more expensive than Edinburgh average.

But re-reading (thankfully something I didn't do before else I might never have returned) reminded me that service and food is something that David Bann is inconsistent with. \n\nNow, this time, I had tomato and basil soup with smoked mushroom ravioli. Oh, sweet lord, I almost turned to religion in my ecstasy over the common tomato soup, because DB has it down pat - I've never tasted such a refreshing, taste-bomb of a bowl. when you add the ravioli to the mix, the heady smoky flavour (think Belhaven smokery, if you know it... if not, well, it's really strong in the smoky department) of the mushroom made it a powerful companion. \n\nThe Silent Reviewer's roasted veg on brioche was... dull by comparison, and there was no way we could see a way to make it sound more exciting than it was. Every bite he took, the envy on his face grew, with a hint of regret for not going with the same as me. \n\nFor the mains, I had the rice pancake with spiced-up chickpeas, cauliflower and cashews (all the c's really did sound inspiring). What I thought was going to be relatively light turned out to be a dense heavy stodgy pancake with a clumsily spiced stuffed - it was alright, but to be honest, it wasn't well executed or a memorable dish.\n\nThe Silent Reviewer had the chili filo tart stuffed with butter and kidney beans. My honest reaction from the description on the menu (and not one I often say unless it revolves around something like macaroni cheese)... it sounded like something I would make at home, and don't take that as some indicator that I am some sort of gastronomic superstar, because I really am not. And it tasted like it was... another dish of forgettable value - for me the best bit was the swede chunky chips - they were delicious, but the SR just looked depressed. \n\nWe finished up sharing the lemon and raspberry posset (which I had the last time... amazeballs again) and the vanilla and orange cheesecake. Once I slowed down enough, I realised that the cheesecake was absolutely fabulous in a rather muted way. \n\nNow, when I say muted, it is because throughout the meal, I had felt more and more rushed. Several times we had to turn the waitress away as we were asked yet again for drinks and menu orders. When ordering the soup we were warned it would take ten mins to prepare. Ten mins? I would assume it would take ten mins for my starter to be prepped anyway, why should that be seen as slow? But that was only a precursor to what happened next. Main course turned up almost as soon as our starters were cleared. Dessert order taken and promptly arrived within minutes. I literally had to pick up my spoon to make like I was still eating in order to keep the overeager staff at bay (this was where I stubbornly slowed down and realised, actually my dessert was pretty good) as I caught out of the corner of my eye the waitress charging towards our table again. I felt rushed, that I ate too fast and ultimately didn't really enjoy the experience. Except for the soup - everything is forgiven for that. \n\nBy the time we were back in the car, it had just turned 9pm. We were seated for 7:30pm - and in that time had knocked back a 3 course meal. I had barely reached half a glass of wine by dessert (seriously, that would normally be a bottle and me eyeing up the liqueur menu).

It's quite polished and clear cut.\n\nBeing vegetarian, and having been recently diagnosed with coeliacs,  I have been having quite a bit of trouble finding restaurants which cater for me, and don't let me feel like I am missing out. The staff here have reserved a few menus where they point out which items are gluten free, onion free, and garlic free. \n\nI was surprised to see quite a few options available from me, even from the pudding menu! The chocolate souffle and whiskey pannacotta stood out in particular.I was debating whether to get a starter and a pudding, or just a maincourse, though in the end settled for the latter. Tanja J's ravioli in a tomato and basil soup looked amazing, though the thai broccoli and tofu fritters which most people on the table looked a little dry? They were also quite small portions, so perhaps not suitable as full meals, unlike Tanja's ravioli. I personally was tempted by the polenta topped with courgettes, sweet potato and goats cheese. To keep us occupied whilst waiting to order, the waitress brought us gluten free oatcakes (I could eat these!), and homemade bread. Though very Scottish, it would perhaps be nice if they could offer gluten free bread, be it homemade, or simply toasted genius bread.

Koftas usually come in a much thicker sauce, though here the koftas only have a light drizzling of sauce. I'm not against fusion food, and I realize this was a Scottish take on the dish, but the lack of sauce made them a little dry, and as others said, they weren't too spicy. I am being quite critical, as this was quite an expensive meal (\u00a311.90) considering the ingredients involved. If priced at around \u00a36, this could be an excellent meal. I was pretty jealous looking at the dishes of those a  few heads down the table, who had ordered the mushroom bake with goats cheese and roasted winter vegetables. That looked truly divine, and well worth the price. I must admit I had high expectations for this place, as it has so many consistently positive reviews and has a good reputation amongst vegetarians in Edinburgh.\n\nOverall it was a good restaurant, which caters well for dietary requirements, people seemed more or less happy with what they got, but I am not sure whether the prices reflect the food. \u00a35.60 for a pannacotta? I realize David Bann has aspirations to be a michelin star vegetarian chef of sorts, but what I had wasn't THAT good. I just can't work out why they don't offer any Lunch deals... I think there is just so much good food in Edinburgh, and I have been well and truly spoiled with amazing vegetarian food. Kalpna is less pretentious, more friendly, more affordable, and offers much tastier food.  As is orb cafe, a raw food restaurant... Though this may not be to everyone's taste, it definitely wins in terms of innovation.\n\nI feel kind of wrong, giving this 3 stars, when it has such consistently high reviews, but I just couldn't justify giving it 4 when comparing it to other restaurants in town. Maybe had I tried something else, I would have had a better impression of the place?", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I had very high hopes for David Bann after reading many glowing reviews on Yelp. Claims that you won't even notice the meat isn't there, that it's the best vegetarian food in the City, and that it's fine dining veggie-style.\n\nThe restaurant itself is very nice inside: a small entrance opens to a very big back room. It was full on a Tuesday night which was a promising sign. The waitresses were very friendly, and they also kindly supplied us with two menus that had all the gluten-free options marked.\n\nThe Aubergine and Chickpea koftas I ordered came with coriander rice, a coconut sauce and a pineapple chutney. Sounds delicious. Whilst I do eat meat, I love vegetarian food and try to eat a proper serving of 5 vegetables a day. So vegeterian food doesn't scare me, quite the opposite - and I was really looking forward to try the best vegetarian food Edinburgh has to offer.\n\nThe koftas arrived as 5 'falafel' sized balls on a plate, next to a neat dome of rice and one salad leaf with what appeared to be some cucumber and yellow pepper on it. There was some sauce drizzled on the koftas.\n\nThey turned out to be quite dry. And I used all the sauce to give them moisture by the 3rd kofta. None left for the 4th and 5th, and nothing to go with the very bland, underseasoned rice. Only when I had finished I commented the pineapple chutney was missing. To which a fellow diner replied it was on top of the salad. Oh, the yellow chunks that look like raw yellow pepper were pineapple, and in fact, a chutney? Hmm.\n\nI have to say I was disappointed with this meal. It came to \u00a311.50 for this course. Given that I can get a meat course for \u00a312 in neighbouring Old Town restaurants to a much higher standard, this felt very steep indeed. I would go so far to say I've had better koftas bought from a supermarket. I'm not one to judge quickly or harshly, and I like to see the best in every situation - but this meal did not live up to the hype this restaurant has garnered over years of serving the vegetarian Edinburgh population.\n\nOthers seemed more satisfied with their meals. But it really felt like nothing extraordinary for me at all. 5 koftas, dry, on an plate with a little sauce and some bland rice, with one lettuce leaf and a disguised chutney that didn't even look or taste like chutney - it was really just pickled pineapple.\n\nI have been told it can be better. But it really didn't impress me enough to try again, and I know I can get better vegetarian dishes in other restaurants in the city. A shame, really, and perhaps I ordered the dud-dish that night.\n\nI can imagine it's still a lovely spot for graduation parties, birthdays, or a special somewhere to take a vegetarian loved-one.

Most of us had heard great things about David Bann and were desperate to try it and although I've given it 4*, it is closer to a 3.5* but we can't do 1/2 stars.\n\nSo what I liked: \n\nI've been in a fair few vegetarian and vegan restaurants around the world whilst travelling and they all seem to have that hippy, patchouli oil feel to them so it was nice to come somewhere that was more upmarket - wooden floors, candles, lovely simple decor. \n\nThere is a separate Gluten Free menu and there is plenty of choice. I was particularly impressed by the desserts. I didn't partake this time but there was plenty of temptation beyond ice-cream or sorbets so that would sway me to return. GF oatcakes as a starter is a nice touch - so many places offer gf options but no bread or oatcakes and tucking in and breaking bread is such a ritual when eating out, so its nice not being the odd one out.\n\nMenu's sounded tempting and I did struggle to decide between a few options (again - choice is good) and as it has been a hellish month at work, then the large glass of red tempranillo I ordered was delish - lovely, warming and smooth.\n\nI probably opted for the wrong starter. I had the Thai Fritters which were ok but I didn't like the banana relish which came with it and it meant they were too similar to my main which was the aubergine and chickpea koftas. The koftas were nice and tasty enough but I did notice varying amounts of sauce on everyone's plate (mines was limited) so I ate them with raita mostly. I just noticed that Jenny has called this coconut sauce and it was meant to be this, but I am certain it was raita on my plate and I liked this. I would have liked the pineapple chutney to have been separated from the raita (raita dumped on top) so I could get all the different flavours. I was ok with the rice compared to Jenny L but I do like rice plain and I'm not a huge coriander fan so I was glad this wasn't the overwhelming flavour.\n\nService was good - staff appeared well organised (little grid used when taking orders so they knew what food went where).\n\nSo what I didn't like:\n\nDavid Bann has a high end reputation. I was thinking Mark Greenaway but pure veggies. This is not the case. This was disappointing.\n\nIt is expensive for what you get - my food was ok but I wasn't wowed. If I describe things as nice then its ok, not mind blowing and nice doesn't justify this price tag. \n\nA few pounds cheaper and it might be ok but it may be a case of paying for the old town location.\n\nI actually thought the presentation was quite basic so although the restaurant was visually appealing, the food wasn't as much. Also the one dish that did look appealing was the mushroom loaf Menno had and that was the one dish that did look like a meaty Sunday roast (with lots of sauce!)...\n\nI have a friend who is vegetarian who does come here, so I would maybe go again, if only to ditch the starters and try the desserts. I'm sure he'd for once like a menu on one of our nights out where he can chose anything from it, not be restricted to one or two items.

It was delish! Not the type of gnocchi I was expecting, they were fried rather than boiled, but v tasty nevertheless. They were served on a bed of baby leaves and beetroot which had some kind of sweet and salty glaze to them. Drool... The smoked cheese cubes sprinkled over the top gave the dish another dimension. Different textures and different taste sensations. Can't believe I'm waxing lyrical over a salad!!! \n\nFor main I opted for the chickpea koftas which was served with coriander rice, a curry sauce and a cucumber and raita salad. I ate every bit! The koftas were soft with a nutty type texture. The sauce not overpowering but really complimented the dish well. Not a scrap was left on my plate! \n\nI did fully intend to have a dessert but between the fennel seed roll at the beginning and the 2 courses I honestly couldn't have managed a dessert (well actually I could have probably squeezed one in but I didn't want my fellow yelpers thinking I'm a greedy cow!). \n\nThe service was great, the waitress really attentive and friendly and she didn't seem irritated by the fact a few of us has to pay separately as we were leaving earlier.

I did think it was a little on the pricey side, but if it was superior quality then it could be worth it, so I had high expectations.\n\nAs I definitely wanted a dessert, I decided I would just have a starter and no main.  I was also trying not to spend too much.  I was disappointed with my Thai fritters of smoked tofu and broccoli with peas, fresh ginger, green chilli, lime leaf, lemongrass, sesame and coriander, served with fresh banana chutney and plum dressing.  Firstly I was expecting fritters would be flat...well, fritters!  Not round balls like they were. I certainly couldn't detect the lime leaf, lemongrass, ginger or coriander which are flavours that I really like.  Along with the other ingredients, these were overpowered by the smokiness of the tofu, although to be fair, I'm not a fan of anything smoked.  The was a hint of heat from the herbs and spices, but again I couldn't pick the flavours.

We didn't get to order any food until twenty minutes in, and then we waited 35 minutes for the food to come out!  If the place were busy I would understand, but there was only two other tables in.  When we finally asked about the food we were told that two of the dishes took a long time to prepare, but no one informed us of this when we ordered- we're in for lunch, we don't have the time to wait 35 minutes for food after waiting twenty to order a pitcher of water!  The food came out and I had serious order envy.  My colleague had a beetroot and blue cheese something that looked and tasted amazing.  My veggies and noodles were... underwhelming.

He told me he just wanted to take a chance and do something that he was passionate about with the pay off being spreading the love to the individual patrons and his community.  From my perspective, they're food artists and if you're going to change the world, it will start by inspiring people to begin on the inside.  Food artists sharing their creation with whoever they can.\n\nWe were served the carefully prepared potato soup, which was a touch spicy with VIBRANT spread of flavors.  Some soups are hella one note.  This was a perfect start.  \nThen the hummus trio (we asked for all veggies vs chips) they obliged without question and hooked us up with a spread that was crisp and colorful.  All hummusessesss (hummisi? lol) were divine.  Not crazy garlicky like Pita Jungle, and creamy but textural.  Most fresh made hummus we've had is very oily.  In fact usually topped with oil to boot.  We purposely saved some so that we could crush it later tonight.  Stoked for that second round! \nMy angel side kick had the VegHead sandwich.  It ended up being the star of the show in retrospect.  The ingredients were so insanely fresh that it makes me think a little less of Wholefoods right now.  Is that possible?   Best way to describe it is \"full\".  The veggies taste full.. not dull.. like its all there somehow.  Something about the hummus in this entree and the onions and greens almost reminded us of a Tuna fish sandwich (which as vegetarian we haven't been able to enjoy in way too long.)  Obviously not a fishy flavor but that same vibe in terms of fulfillment and an after taste that we're still smiling about.  Yep we trieddd.. I mean struggled to save a little of this too so we could experience it later.   We did this because we live out in the west valley and only get down here once a month. \nOk so my entree was the Protein Quinoa Bowl.  Epic.  The ingredient spread is exactly the Eat to Live balance that your body knows exactly what to do with.  Ie. nothing gets stored as fat, you feel energized and satisfied but not sleepy and useless.  I actually got crafty and ate it in the same bite as some hummus.  Something about that combo just gives you the WTF eye roll when something is perfect.  \nWe preceded the meal with iced americanos (good) and then Sean hand made me a pour over of a local organic coffee (great) that was smooth and had a sneaky undertone of Amaretto.  So Fun@!  Local organic coffee has been super tough to find for us so this was a nice surprise. \n\nThings people have said on Yelp: :Not FAST food\".  I.e. - they had to wait for their food.  Our response because we've tried to make organic fresh at home, is it takes a good amount of prep when it's done at the time you're about to eat (vs. pre-prepped).\n\nLastly.. we always chuckle over the craziness of living in a society where you have to pay extra for non-poisioned (ie Organic)  food.  Wholefoods/Trader Joes .. etc.    But there is salvation.

I also appreciate how kind she was about it. I have seen posts from owners from other restaurants bashing customers for having an opinon. Its refreshing to see an owner who does the exact opposite. Knowing now that the microwaves are used only to boil water I feel better knowing that what I ate was not cooked in the microwave. I will definaly be back to try out all of your other breakfast dishes!     4/26/11\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI came in here really wanting to love this place. I am always looking for more vegan places to eat because my ultimate goal is to go completely vegan sometime in the near future. We came in at around 8:30 on Saturday morning. That is one thing I have to say about their Saturday hours. Everywhere except their Facebook page says they open at 11 on Saturdays, and even the sign outside of the store says they open at 11, but they actually open at 8 on Saturdays. We might have been the first people in there because of this. And nobody came in after us until about 9:15. Maybe people are confused about the hours? I don't know. But from the reviews on this place I expected it to be jumping. I know every time I go to Pomegranate Cafe this early its packed. So maybe update your website and sign out front? Just a suggestion. \n\nAnyways, so we walked in and ordered. I got the vegan eggs benedict, and my husband got the tofu scramble and one of the smoothies. So we sit down and wait for our food to come out. Now I don't want to be picky, but this is one of the things I notice when I walk into a place. Its small, yes. That doesn't bother me. It just didn't feel clean to me. Most of the tables had stuff all over them and weren't cleaned right. There was dust all over everything. And a giant dead mosquito watched me pretty much my entire breakfast from the window where he was caught in a spiders web. For a place this size, there really shouldn't be any reason why it was a dirty as it was. Maybe that doesn't bother some people, but I was put off by all of the dust. \n\nThe other thing I noticed that really bugged me, is how many times I heard them open and close the microwave. Aren't restaurants supposed to use pots and pans? I don't think I heard the sound of a pot clanging one time. And I have stopped going to restaurants in the past because I found out they use microwaves. If I want to use a microwave, I'll go home and cook myself. I didn't come here to pay ten dollars for breakfast, for it to be made entirely in the microwave. Honestly, I would rather wait an hour for breakfast so it can be made on the stove, than to have it done in ten minutes out of a microwave. \n\nSo after about 15 to 20 minutes our food comes out. It is a lot more than I thought it was going to be. I had two pieces of toast with four pieces of tofu bacon, then topped with two tofu \"eggs\" with avocado and garlic aoli. It was served with a salad and fresh fruit. The salad was a little odd for breakfast, but it tasted good. I liked the dressing and sunflower seeds. I really liked the eggs benedict. It had a good flavor and even for as much food as it was I ate everything on my plate. My husband also liked his scrambled tofu which came with toast and jam, fresh fruit and two pieces of tofu bacon. For ten dollars you really do get what you pay for. \n\nI really want to come back here because I did like the food, however I don't know that I will knowing how much they do use the microwave. Maybe some people don't care about that, but I do. Perhaps, I will just have to come back and try their raw options.

The salad was big and also very fresh, loved the tangy/sweet dressing - with a proper serving size of about 2 Tbsp THANK YOU!  (hate having a nice salad dripping with 1/3 cup of gooey dressing)  \n\nI thought both items had a nice amount of flavor and the veggies tasted like they'd spent a good amount of time in the earth as they should. I finished off with a Cliffs of Dover fruit juice blend, was a little sweeter than I expected but that was just fine with my sweet tooth.  $15 total for my lunch, and I was full & satisfied for the entire afternoon.\n\nMy new friend went with the falafel burger and it looked so good, nice and moist and she loved the sauce.  Another customer asked her what it was because it looked so tasty.  I'd just made falafel the day before or I'd have gone with it - oh well, next time.  The other burgers sound great too!\n\nI noticed some reviews commenting about 24C being out of different things, as they were when I went.  With a varied daily menu with fresh ingredients its hard to anticipate so I don't fault them for that.  \n\nI'll definitely be back again.

Nutritionally conscious Arizonans should consider themselves lucky to have an establishment like this which provides foods sourced locally, ethically, organically, and most importantly for me, THAT TASTE OH SO GOOD. The food here is just straight blissful---whether you're a meat-eater, vegetarian, vegan, raw-curious, any of the above--they really make an effort to appeal to all of the palates, I noticed. The tastes and colors are so vibrant and every dish I had was done with care and craftsmanship. Everything came together on the dishes; nothing seemed to clash--a sign that there is a good deal of culinary ingenuity behind the restaurant concept. I oftentimes wonder why people even need meat or dairy when vegan food can be made to taste this irresistible. So far I have had the Juevos Rancheros, the Smoked Bacon BLT, their house veggie burger, and a special of the day, an enchilada dish. I honestly don't understand any of the negative reviews; they seem trifling and unsubstantial. Recognize the overarching reality that you are getting some of the very best quality nutrition possible prepared sooo yummily. To me, that's all that matters.

To make matters worse (but actually better), breakfast was served all day, so between the lunch, specials, juices, smoothies, baked goods, and breakfast... the selection seemed virtually endless. Our cashier/server was polite and incredibly patient as we asked a large number of unnecessary questions, frantically attempting to rationalize our menu-oriented decisions. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes had passed, I was still torn between the french toast and the BLT, so we agreed to order the french toast as an appetizer for the table. Thank the flying spaghetti monster we did. This may win the 'best classic french toast that ever was' award, vegan or not. It tastes like a cross between brioche and challah (butter bread and egg bread?), so I'm rather befuddled in regards to how they achieved that consistency, sans butter or eggs. Whatever, it's probably best I just stuff my mouth full of fresh fruit and warm, maple-y french toast and don't ask questions, anyway.\n\nThe BLT ended up being satisfactory, but from what I read online, I was expecting more. I don't remember tasting onions, avocado, cucumber, or aioli, so if it was there somewhere... I missed it. My friend disliked her tofu breakfast burrito, and I found it somewhat bland myself, but we brought it home and my boyfriend ate the entire thing in five minutes flat. However, quinoa tabooli was delicious, as was the tikka masala we received after our meal (thanks, Sasha, you rock!). Ethnic food is definitely a go at 24 Carrots.\n\nFor dessert, we shared a chocolate cake doughnut. It didn't stay together like a real cake doughnut, but it was much better than one... more like a ring of dense, chocolate cake. We also had the pleasure of trying an experimental raw cheesecake. It tasted a lot like chia seed-y, vanilla bean panna cotta with a bottom layer of delicious crust. Needless to say, everyone loved it (thanks, Daniel, you rock!) We also may have donated a dollar to charity in exchange for a mini chocolate cupcake. All worth it.\n\nOn the whole, unless you LOVE tofu, I recommend the sweet breakfast options. The one thing that's disappointing about this menu is that the entire savory selection of breakfast is tofu-based. However, with options like homemade granola, french toast, and maca oatmeal, I think I'll survive.

I've watched this place grow from having a small handful of smoothies, juices, and teas to having a full fledged menu offering breakfast, lunch, dinner, and everything in between while keeping the original drink menu and even expanding on it. What a perfect example of a local business success story!\n\nI cannot speak for the food as I have yet to try any of it, but I can attest that no matter what you get for a smoothie, you cannot go wrong. My personal favorite is the Peachy Keene with a scoop of whey protein added in (which you can do for any smoothie for $1 extra). The uniquely amazing thing about how they prepare their smoothies is that they use frozen fruits, which eliminates the need for ice or ice cream to make the drink cold and in turn makes it much more flavorful. They're always thick, and you always get some leftover fruit on the bottom that didn't quite get mixed in with the rest very well, but hey at least you have a bit of a snack!\n\nLike others have pointed out, this place has a very laid back atmosphere so don't come here if you are in a big hurry.

The lady making our juice didn't look like she had a clue how to make the juice in the proper portions, tossing veggies and fruits in there like an experiment! It took her 3 times to get it right with her wasting time running back and forth to the back to grab more veggies. Not only does this NOT make sense, but it's a HUGE waste of time.

The texture of the \"chicken\" was kind of like a mix between fish and chicken, and was tender on the inside. The pieces were nicely seasoned and had a nice outer crunch from the deep-frying. The \"chicken\" nuggets were placed on a bed of romaine, with a slice of carrot and cucumber.

But the latter is my ultimate body-loving goal - at least 80% of the time! But you're not reading this to hear about my culinary goals.\n\nThis month, the S.O. and me have dubbed December 2009 - Vegetarian Month. Sadly, it had only been two days and I was already craving meat for dinner so I made my 3rd visit to Loving Hut - Glendale.\n\nFirst off, let's discuss the Location: I now (temporarily) reside in Glendale and this location is a pain in the @$$ even for me. Sheesh! It's near nothing of importance and if I were these brilliant enterprisers, I would search for a more convenient location for the veg-loving crowd.\n\nNow, onto the Food and Service! The reason I gave this place 4 stars follows:\n\n1) Phoenix, the sweet, customer service-oriented server\n\n2) The Mongolian Wonder dish at a mere $7.25. If you try nothing else here, eat this dish, people! Trying to convert an Ominivore?  Feed 'em this and don't tell them it's not meat. If I could learn how to convert soy protein (which I try not to eat too much of due to it's estrogen-mimicking...), I would never touch red meat again without even a second thought. I don't know what's in the \"homemade spices\", but this meal is a brilliant substitute for the real thing. Have it with the steamed rice. I usually find white, steamed rice boring, but in this case, you don't want any flavors competing with this masterpiece. Oddly, though, it doesn't come with the rice but it's only an additional $1.50.\n\n3) The simple message of doing our part to save the planet just by changing our diet works for me, even if only part-time. The decor is minimalistic and effective.\n\n4) The water served before your meal is infused with orange and totally changes how i feel about restaurant water. I pass on straight-from-the-tap-water. Shut up! I know I'm a bit snobbish.\n\n5) The Golden wontons are a yummy sub to the cream cheese-filled crab angels one usually gets at Asian-style restaurants. The orange joy is yummy but a bit pricey at $3.25 as is the Mumbai Spirit Chai.\n\n6) There are a few products for sale should you wanna try and replicate something tasty you've had there. I've had no such luck but bought the products anyway. The Veggie \"chicken\" are ok. \n\nWhy I don't give Loving Hut 5 stars:\n\n1) Location. Union Hills and 35th Ave.  Please MOVE!\n\n2) The hours. I sometimes \"forget\" to eat and once made a concentrated trek way over to their location to try it for the first time only to find it closed. Arghh...There is a  2 hour time frame between 3 and 5 when they are closed.\n\n3) Soy - Do your own research, but too much soy is just not healthy, yet it is in nearly every dish on the menu. Then the question is whether or not the soy is organic. Cause if it ain't, it's probably GMO (Genetically-Modified Organisms), and you don't wanna go there. I'll have to ask about that next time. \n\n4) Not gonna go into detail but the whole \"Supreme Master\" thing kind of has a cult-like feel to it. But no one's trying to make me join anything, so I don't dwell.\n\n5) I was very unimpressed on my 1st visit but decided to try again. The fried rice was dry and not very flavorful. And their \"Golden Beauty\" which is a much less flavorful and less salty version of The International Vegetarian House's Lemongrass \"chicken\", tasted very...soy-ee.\n\n6) I'm not into the \"Go-up-to-the-counter-and-place-your-order-then-I'll-bring-your-food-to-you\" thing. I believe in full serve at a restaurant, especially if you're expecting me to tip.\n\n7) It's a chain. Who knew?\n\nBottom line: If you're looking for a new vegetarian restaurant to try and you have time on your hands to make the hike to the most inconvenient location on the planet (heh, heh...I'm such an exaggerator), then try this place at least once. And if you're craving beef, go for the Mongolian Wonder dish. You won't be disappointed.\n\n(Later in) December 2009 update: Oh my! The Hawaiian burger is absolutely divine. I LOVE IT!\n\nAlso, I received a message from Loving Hut regarding this review. They wanted me to know that they are NOT-FOR-PROFIT, the location is family-owned and that the main goal of the restaurant is to promote \"compassion\".

I understand people who are not vegan come here, some enjoy it, some don't. What I don't get is people spending half their review talking about how much they love meat, dairy, dead things that used to have a mother, etc :-). It makes you look like more of a jackass because you are lauding it at a restaurant that is explaining why to go Vegan all over the walls and TV!! Yes, I am a Vegan, but don't tell me I don't \"understand\", I was an omnivore for 28 years who used to eat lots of all kinds of meat, cheese, dairy and NEVER ever considered going Vegan - that argument doesn't fly with me. If you are interested there is a wealth of information out there so get educated. It's a process for most(like me) but a rewarding one and you might just surprise yourself. I am always willing to talk to anyone about my \"experience\" as what most of society would call me \" a non traditional vegan\".\n\nAnyone still reading? Ok good, now onto Loving Hut. This review is really more of a 3-3.5 review but since it's a new vegan place in Phoenix metro it gets a 4 in my book. I think they could do much better in a better location, CenPho anyone? That being said, I work close by and this section of N Phx seems like anti-vegan land. So the fact that I have a 100% vegan place to go for lunch in this area is a bonus for me, although I am constantly going there alone since none of my coworkers would ever set foot in such a place(see \"jackass\" comment above).\n\nMost of the food here is decent, the eggplant and tofu is a good dish with a side of brown rice. The BBQ sandwich is also very good. I enjoy most of their apps as well, I had the Hawaiian burger once and wasn't that impressed - I make a better veggie burger at home(probably healthier too). Don't mistake this for health food, but its better then your standard meal at the local Chili's. Let's face it, people don't go out to be as healthy as possible, everything in moderation though(well not EVERYTHING).\n\nThe staff is always very friendly and the prices seem reasonable on most of the dishes. I would rather create a Vegan meal at home then drive here for dinner, but for lunch when I need it, it works and I enjoy it. I hope they stay around and in business, I wouldn't be heartbroken though if they moved to an area where a vegan establishment might do better.\n\nPS. They changed the names on the menu since they opened, I am not sure what prompted it but its a good change. I don't like any vegan places that includes the animal they are trying to imitate. Vegan food can stand on its own, soy, wheat, etc protein can stand on its own. It has its own flavor, texturee and benefits it doesnt need(nor should be) compared to something else. I get that calling something soy \"chicken\" helps with getting people to transition to the diet but call it what it is, soy meat, wheat meat, nut milk, nut meat etc. Animal by products don't have a monopoly on the word \"meat\" or \"milk\" or \"cheese'.

I always used to end up travelling to one of those east valley restaurants in such occasions. \n\nWhen we entered the establishment the welcome was awesome. Although we had gone so close to the closing hours the staff did not show any signs of it. They patiently explained their menu, and recommended some of the finest selections. All of us were hungry and ended up ordering most them: BBQ Rolls, Chow Mein, Seaweed Ocean, SAVE-PLANET Curry, steamed rice, Silky Flan, Banana Fritters, and the Mumbai Spirit (Tea). They complimented us with a soup that we had left out. It was an awesome dinner and a great start for the New Year. My family loved all of the items we ordered and most importantly the warm eastern hospitality that we had missed for many years.  \n\nI am sure you will enjoy this place irrespective of your normal food habits or favorites.  Even vegetarians might be surprised to find many vegetarian versions of the western cuisine.  The food price is good; a couple can get a full meal dinner within $30. The place is clean, bright and the aura gives you a soothing feeling. It might be a nice surprise for east valley residents to find such a nice eatery located in the west valley.\n\nI can't wait to go back there again just to try the next set of items from their exotic vegan menu.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "One word: AWESOME.

The only thing I'm really unhappy about is the fact that they're closed on Sundays, which is probably the most convenient day for me to visit.  Also, they charge an extra $1.50 if you want rice.  I realize a lot of people waste rice when it's automatically included with a dish, but I think charging an extra $1.50 is a bit ridiculous considering the actual cost of rice (I know because I make it all the time at home).  I think that they should provide rice at no extra charge but only include it if the customer requests it, or if nothing else, lower the charge for rice to perhaps 50 cents.\n\nOn my first visit, I tried their Fabulous Pho.  Overall, it was quite good, although I wish that they had served the noodles on the side because when the soup was served, the noodles were overly soft by that point.  Even so, it was tasty, with tofu, slices of vegan \"beef\" and \"tripe\" with the typical side serving of lime and bean sprouts that is traditionally served with pho.  I can't remember if there was any vegan fish cake in it or not.  I had their Sunny Forest drink, which was refreshing.  My friend ordered the Golden Wontons, Sweet and Sour Divine, and Orange Joy.  She enjoyed all of her selections, but was flipping with joy over the Sweet and Sour Divine, which is a \"chicken\" type dish.  I tried a bite of hers and the sauce perfectly seasoned - the \"chicken\" was very yummy as well.  I'm not even usually a fan of sweet and sour dishes but even I was impressed with this one.\n\nOn the second visit, I ordered the Spicy Cha Cha, Ice Mumbai Spirit, and also took some cheesecake and Mongolian Wonder to save for lunch the next day.  Despite the extra charge for rice, I'm glad I ordered the brown rice this time because the Spicy Cha Cha was indeed quite spicy for my mild-mannered taste buds.  Breaded mock shrimp were served on a bed of lettuce that had a spicy ground \"meat\" and veggie garnish.  Very delicious and something that I'd definitely order again.  I didn't care for the Ice Mumbai Spirit, though, as it tasted like I was inhaling the beauty section at Whole Foods.  It had a very perfumed flavor that was hard for me to stomach, but then again, I've been spoiled by Rishi chai tea.\n\nThe next day, I ate my Mongolian Wonder and cheesecake.  The cheesecake was quite good, with a little drizzle of raspberry (or strawberry?) sauce on top.  I prefer my cheesecake crusts to have a higher graham cracker percentage but I still really enjoyed.  The Mongolian Wonder was nicely seasoned and very tender, without being overwhelmed by the onions, although I wished I had ordered some rice (or remembered to make some at home) to go with it since it was a tad salty.\n\nThe staff are quite friendly.  A complimentary light soup is brought out prior to your meal.  Although the videos playing (that many have mentioned) are a little silly, the screens are set on a low volume and easy to tune out.\n\nOverall, I'm quite pleased with The Loving Hut and will be sure to visit as often as my budget allows it.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 3, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "Went back here for lunch today.

Disappointed, I actually asked whether they could put it on after reading some of the reviews on here, just to have a bit of a laugh. On it came. It's not that bad - there was some Asian woman getting laughs from an audience, evidently the opening act for the Supreme Master himself. It all comes from California, apparently - why doesn't this surprise me? We chuckled for a bit (mainly at how rapidly the subtitles and other stuff were flashing on the screen, almost like Max Headroom blipverts) then turned to our food. I got the pho with their Golden Rolls, the boss got a bowl of curry with a side of brown rice served in the traditional way (bowl up and over). All it needed was a hershey's chocolate kiss on the top and it would have looked just like a tit. Anyway. The pho was actually pretty good - they made a fine job out of cloning standard pho dac biet, even to the extent of having some gristly stuff that simulated tripe. The \"meat\" was pretty good - I too was really surprised that it looked and tasted so close to regular meat. The boss liked his stuff as well. A touch on the expensive side (veggie stuff should be just a little cheaper than eight bucks a pop, which is what some of their entrees cost) but on the whole it's pretty tasty stuff. And the people in there are sort of amusing. I ordered my pho and the guy goes \"whoa, that'll taste really good\".. I told him I usually went for the dac biet and he was like.. \"yeah yeah, this is just as good.. except.. BETTER.\" I said that I was expecting to become a supreme master after eating it or else I was going to be asking for my money back. The little old server lady was very nice; she saw me eating rolls with my fingers and dropped off some chopsticks for me so I didn't get ketchupy paws.

It seems to be gaining in popularity too - had about five or six tables with patrons today, despite the Supreme Master telly droning on in the background. It actually reminds me of the \"a new life awaits you in the off-world colonies!\" stuff from Blade Runner. Today's programming showed some kangaroos jumping around and happily munching grass, along with someone blathering on about how studies have shown that they play an important ecological role in blah blah blah. Anyway! Foodwise, I got my (now favourite) Golden Rolls, and decided to try something different with the Chow Mein. The latter was good, but I probably wouldn't order it again since I liked other dishes better. Next time I think I'll give the Hawaiian Burger a go. I definitely recommend the Golden Rolls - the dipping sauce is great as well.\n\nIf you eat there rather than take away you'll get a little bowl of soup - their version of miso, I guess, with carrot, green onion, celery (yeuch) and tofu bits.\n\nCame away feeling satisfied but not grossed out - typical of vegetarian meals.

They barely gave me any soup in it and they gave me a hard time about it.\n\nBottom line is that they need to be better at providing what the customer wants and less about penny pinching, as it is very annoying and it does not make me want to go back.\n\nChanging up the menu by offering unique, limited time dish specials would also greatly improve the place, as much of the menu seems to be very similar (the same flavored soy protein is in just about everything).\n\nHoping they can improve...", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 6, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Unfortunately I will no longer be recommending Loving Hut.

Bordering on a complete rip-off.\n\nI got my usual Golden Vermicelli with a side of the Golden Rolls since I really like those (the GV comes with two rolls already). With tax, minus any drink and minus the $1 tip that I felt obliged to add since there was a tip section on the docket, the total was $13.12. I already mentioned that they've hiked their prices from the outdated menu that I got a few months ago, but I took another look at what I got and I'm not impressed at all with the value for money.\n\nLet's break it down. Shredded lettuce, shredded carrots, a half teaspoon of ground peanut with half as much again of finely chopped fried onion, a good amount of noodles (maybe even 20c worth), and a container of extremely watered down liquid - maybe 100 parts water to 1 part sweet and sour sauce? It's not a dip and not a sauce, just something to wet down the noodles with. Maybe 2 slices of julienned cucumber, and their soy protein. Took a photo. Compare today's pic with the first one I took of the same dish. There's even less soy protein now, barely enough for two mouthfuls, and a couple of fried rolls the length and width of my extended middle finger. I'm not sure how expensive soy protein itself is but thirteen spondooliks for that is twice as much as it is worth in terms of raw ingredients, far as I'm concerned.\n\nThe place is still clean. The service is still okay. Servers and counter folk are still very polite. Still conveniently located near my work. Still has Super Master on the telly. Still has a posterboard near the counter with bizarre letters and postcards from people verbally flagellating their pudendae about how awesome the place is, and the food is still tasty. Just woefully, WOEFULLY overpriced. This same syndrome exists at Tandoori Times II. I'd eat there AND here three times as often if only they delivered an amount of their food which matches the exorbitant prices they charge.\n\nAm I all about quantity over quality? Hell no. We're talking about a guy who paid over fourteen bucks for a small cube of fois gras on a 2\" square bit of bread w/apricot compote, spent the next thirty minutes drooling over it and the next two years daydreaming about it. We're talking about a guy who just ate mostly lettuce and noodles and got charged twice the price of a lunch almost anywhere else in the local area, except for places like Claim Jumper or Olive Garden. Do I think 2 stars are appropriate a rating? Yelp classifies that as \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" So, yes.\n\nEven if you're a vegetarian, avoid this place. Save your cash. Go to Safeway. Buy a pack of noodles for a buck. Buy a whole lettuce for a buck. Buy carrots for.. you get the general idea. Buy some frozen edamame, mash it all up, squirt a bit of soy and worcester on it, form it into mint-patty-shaped discs and grill. I'm betting that'll be the same nutrition/protein and color as what their stuff is. Just pass on dining at this joint like I will be.\n\nI thought about posting this review for a while. The tipping point was the tiny gnat that I noticed on a piece of lettuce and would have eaten had I not been hunched close over the meal in my cubicle. Could have flown into the container, through the plastic bag etc, on the way out to the car, on the way back to the office, on the way INTO the office from the car. Or could have landed during food prep. I spent the next five minutes visually analysing the rest of the food before realising that there could be more gnats in the fried rolls where I'd have no hope of noticing them.

i love loving hut. the two of us had been very afraid that when we came here we were going to experience something along the lines of tina fey's romantic encounter in baby mama, where they confusingly [try to] eat a yeast ball. it was not so. their menu items are confusingly meatlike in texture, although i have no idea how close the flavours are to meat. \n\nhere are individual dish reviews:\narigato sushi: these sushi rolls are good, although there is better vegetable sushi to be found elsewhere. they taste strongly of the pickles, mostly.\nspring rolls: i enjoy the spring rolls a lot, most likely due to the use of jicama. the leek is too strong for me (which is not very bizarre, for someone who hates onions).\np\u00e2t\u00e9 chaud: although i have never had meat p\u00e2t\u00e9, i somehow doubt this competes very well with it. it was mostly puff pastry and very little filling.\ngolden nuggets: these are very perfect for anyone craving something small and crispy with a token flavour. it would not constitute a meal, which is why they are listed in the appetizer section- these are minuscule.\nhawaiian burger: i love pineapple + it is so hard to go wrong with a burger, in my opinion, so this is a pretty easy success. sometimes the paddies restaurants offer are disgusting (boca, yuck), but this one seems to be made in house. their french fries are thankfully crisp and not dried out or soggy.\nbbq baguette: a bit on the minimalistic side, the flavours here are all good and well, and the bbq soy protein tastes good but sometimes has questionably unsettling texture when eaten alone (e.g. if it falls out of your baguette). the sandwich filling to baguette ratio is maybe 1:3- not very meaty.\nbbq vermicelli: i am not a peanut fan (and this is topped with peanuts), but those are negligible and can be pushed aside. i would definitely recommend this, as this is the first item that my partner ordered when we ate here that long, long time ago. the only difficulty we had was using the chopsticks to handle everything at once. the vermicelli was good when we ate it and not over/undercooked. we have ordered this many times.\nspicy cha cha: this is essentially the vegan version of fried shrimp. this is the first thing i ate when i came here on account of the first two things i attempted to order being out of stock. it is really impressive that they even have those strange red stripes on their pseudo shrimp, which has a bit of a spongey consistency (that is visible if examined). the flavour is well composed and cohesive throughout. when it comes to spice, if you are a gringo, you probably do not want this, although i think for most people it is very mild.\ncarrot cake: this cake is wonderful and has a very nice combination of sweet flavours; it is especially good with a coffee drink on the side, or soy milk.\nbanana cake: this cake is a little more dry than their carrot cake, but otherwise since i am not as fond of banana flavoured things that are not bananas, my opinion of this dish is pretty heavily biased.\nbanana fritters: if you like banana fritters, there is no reason not to get these. these are good. they are not spectacular but are very far from terrible. this has real bananas in it obviously so it is not influenced by that bias.\npink lady: my partner orders this every single time we come here. she loves it to an amount i could never quantify. sometimes toward the bottom of the glass it begins to taste mostly like flowers, which is cool if you are THAT kind of vegan.\nsunny forest: it is a perfect combination of orange and mint. sometimes i wish they would put a little more sparkling water in it. this is my drink of choice, and i will order it every time i come here. \norange joy: because i love orange juice, i automatically think that this is good. the cranberry juice adds a nice bit of tartness in combination.\nhappy go lucky: hey, if you like lemon and lime together with a subtle hint of rose, this is probably for you! i think it is kind of boring compared to their other drinks, which are a little stronger, with more body.\nice mumbai spirit: i have only had this once; this is a good iced chai. if i remember correctly, it was slightly less sweet than the chai you get from most coffee shops, but all of the spice flavour is there.\n\nenjoy!

Great, thats what a lunch special usualy includes...small orders of a few different items.  Nope, when i called back to order this special, i was told I was to choose one of the 3, not that i get all 3.  So I ordered the Blissful Fried Rice. When I went in to pick it up, it was ready and thats always a plus to not have to wait on an order that was called in 20 minutes prior.  I then ordered a Mumbai Spirit, or hot chai, and my total came to $10, and I left $1 tip.  When the cashier made my drink she poured a pre-made chai mix into a steaming pot, steamed it for a solid 4 seconds and poured it into what looked like it should be a childs cup, or water cup at any other place.  When she handed me the drink it felt like there was nothing in the cup but foam, and the paper it was made out of.  I opened it up to find that my childs size cup was only filled half way, and i asked her if I could have her fill the cup as I paid $3 for this drink. She told me thats how much you get if you eat in, therefor thats how much i get it if i take it to go.\n\nSo to round out my LAST experience at The Loving Hut, I paid $6 for a small container of rice with some bits of carrots, peas, tofu, and cilantro. I would say this order cost them a solid $0.75 to make, and my pre-made 3 1/2 sips of chai that was steamed to a foamy perfection, was maybe $0.40 because of the waste of paper cup.\n\n I REALLY wanted to be able to love this place and eat here often, as there are next to no vegetarian or vegan places around, but for the price I will happily go somewhere else like Mellow Mushroom, who have a few tofu, tempeh, and veggie items, and be able to pay the same prices for food that is delicous.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I am not a vegetarian but I enjoy vegetarian/vegan food on occasion.

We ordered the spicy cha cha and BBQ baguette. The spicy cha cha was veggie-based protein with sliced and diced bell peppers, tomatoes, some onions, and lettuce. It had a good kalamari-like texture with a crispy outside and a chewy (but not frustratingly so) inside. And the bell peppers gave it a good complimentary heat.\n\nThe BBQ baguette was essentially a Vietnamese banh mi imitation except they added a couple of untraditional things like a lil tomato slice, mushrooms, and a generous slathering of \"veganaise\" (some kind of vegan sauce?). And yes, while it was delicious, it can't stand up to a real Vietnamese banh mi sandwich. However, I did very much appreciate the presence of pickled carrots and daikon which makes it much more authentic.\n\nI had one of their specialty drinks: the sunny forest, a concoction of orange juice, zesty flower petals, mint, and sparkling water. But somehow, the citrus is completely drowned out by an overpowering sweetness, as if they dumped several spoonfuls of sugar into the mix. Not very appetizing.\n\nSo why 3 stars if the food is good? The price. There's no way I can justify the prices here. The portions are criminally small. A small plate of food will average $6-8.

Past the exhibit is the main room- covered in graffiti, painting and miss-matched furniture- where food and drinks are served. The food is cheap and reasonably tasty, though not exceptional. My nachos were pretty good, costing \u00a33. Although non-alcoholic drinks are served, you may also bring your own booze, making the Forest Cafe a cheap option for a night out. The staff are friendly, in fact most are volunteers who choose to work to earn their keep in the rooms above.\n\nAt night bands play on a stage in the main room and the place livens up. Worth a visit if only to see some of the weird and wonderful clientele, don't feel intimidated by the piercings; grab a bongo and get involved!", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Okay so the Forest Cafe is another place that has been reviewed a million times, but I feel I might still be able to offer some kind of valuable opinion.\n\nFirst off any faults I have with the Forest Cafe are nothing to do with it being vegetarian or vegan cafe. Again I feel like so many of the complaints about vegetarian places seem to confuse the fact that a place can be crap, like crap service and or crap cleanliness or crap food, regardless of it being vegetarian. In fact if the Forest Cafe did serve animal then its faults would be worse, for reasons we will come to. But for whats it's worth I don't agree with the fundamentalist view that  has been aired that animals were \"put on Earth\" to be eaten by humans (and I think most scientists would agree). I appreciate it's vegetarian/vegan stance, if nothing else its one more place vegetarians can go without having to worry about what's in their food. And as I have alluded to in other reviews, I'm sure meat eaters can still appreciate the occasional meat free dish in principal. Thus I don't find the fact that the Forest is vegetarian/vegan in itself to be a valid criticism (and suggesting vegetarianism is synonymous with hippyism is also ridiculous).\n\nANYWAY if you hadn't guessed from my ramblings already the Forest is a vegetarian cafe, as well as a meeting spot and venue. It's also volunteer run. As others have mentioned there is a sort of  \"hippy\", New Age aesthetic, although both those words are pretty meaningless.\n\nSo what are my problems with the Forest? My first is hygiene. Whilst the food can be just fine, and it's cheap too, the number of times I have been served dishes that have been lying out for too long, or the tables haven't been wiped in a long while. Can you see my point about meat now? The toilets have also been less than appealing on certain occasions in the past.\n\nThese are the sorts of things that bother me. I love that the Forest is volunteer run, I love that it's very liberal and relaxed about most, but those things need not be synonymous with disorganisation and uncleanliness. If anything that just furthers a stereotype that pervades some of these other reviews. My only other complaint is that whilst the Forest can be, as I have mentioned, a wonderfully open and easy going place where anyone can voice their opinion, it can contradictorily be a bit cliquey. I have found that some nights, during discussions and meetings, there are certain well known individuals who drown out and mock dissenting voices. It is the New Age eco dogmatic view in particular which seems to prevail without as much criticism as its deserves. Having said this, the Forest remains largely unhierarchal. And at how many other cafes can you even attend meeting and voice such opinions on how they are run in the first place?\n\nThe one thing I love and respect about the Forest is that you can go in and spend as much time as you like in there without buying a thing. How many places let you do that? I was recently thrown out of a pub after fifteen minutes of not buying anything while I was waiting for someone, and I was one of only three people in there! I like the Forest's stance on just being a place to \"hang\" if you so choose.\n\nSo whilst the Forest has so many great things going for it, there is room for improvement. Those anarchists and communitarians that use the Forest as a meeting place, should especially mind their own proclamations of unhierarchal social organisation, and its compatibility with order and effectiveness. The Forest needs to be a little more ordered and effective!", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I suppose its appropriate that the reviews of the Forest are often political and people focused.

All of their menu items taste great and are also very appealing visually.  They use a lot of fresh ingredients and everything is fruit and acai based.

I haven't tried many of their smoothies, but they all sound great.

The staff is always super nice and warm towards anyone who comes through the doors, even when they are crazy busy.  They are really good at accommodating phone orders and do a good job in paying attention to large orders, like when our whole office decides to call in at once.  Their gift cards are a great little treat to give and receive.   \n\nI only have two reasons for it not getting a perfect five stars: \n\n1. Since they opened the Tempe location and have updated their menus, you get quite a bit less acai blended goodness per bowl and they have instead added a lot of \"fluff\" to the top in the way of extra granola and fresh toppings.  Personally, I liked it better before when they offered more substance than just a scoop of granola and a few banana slices.  \n\n2.  I think it's a little pricey for what you get.  A medium sized bowl averages around $8 .  These are all items that can be easily re-created at home for a fraction, but, I guess you pay for convenience and a clean kitchen. \n\nDefinitely a place I know I will go back to time and time again though.

We were excited to have a healthy smoothie alternative to Jamba close by.  My first thought walking in was that they didn't have the ingredients listed for the smoothies up on the menu board.  I found a paper menu but that didn't have them either.  I don't need a nutritional breakdown, but all the other smoothie places at least tell you what type of fruit, juice, if there's ice or yogurt, etc.  We asked about several smoothies and they listed the ingredients for us.  We chose our three and then waited.  And waited.  And waited.  I found it strange that they make their smoothies in the back room where you can't see them.  I like how Jamba, Inta Juice, Juice it Up, and most other smoothie shops all make theirs out front so you can see the ingredients and the progress.  There was no one ahead of us in line so it was strange that it took so long.  After 10-15 minutes, they brought them out.\n\nWe left and as we all started drinking them, the taste was okay.  I've had many acai smoothies from different places and made them at home and I noticed that the distinct acai flavor was not there.  But since I had a green smoothie, I figured it might have been the veggies disguising it.  But I couldn't really taste those either.  I did however taste LOTS of banana.  They did not list banana when we asked them about the smoothies so I was not happy about that since I don't like banana and would have left that out.  We were already about 10 minutes into our next errand by the time I asked the kids about theirs.  They both said they tasted like banana rather than the flavor they ordered and sure enough, it was a mild fruit flavor with lots of banana taste.  We weren't told about the banana in the kids' smoothies either.  It actually made me wonder what else they added that they didn't tell me about.\n\nI drank mine and the kids drank most of theirs, mostly because we were hungry and paid so much for them.  My large which was smaller than the medium at all the other smoothie places, was $8 and the kids mediums which might be the same as a small (16 oz) at other smoothie places were almost $6 each.  \n\nWe wanted to love this place because we are fans of healthy smoothies and frequent many different smoothies shops around Arizona and California but between the cost, the slow service, and the just-okay taste, we probably won't be back.

Just a few tables that gives you the coziness that accompanies soup. The menu was a little difficult to read though, as it was scribbled in a grey-ish chalk that blended with the erase marks from previous days. \n\nAfter deciphering the menu we decided that everything sounded delicious. We asked to try the Roasted Butternut Squash before ordering it, and were less than thrilled. There was absolutely no flavor to it. I love making butternut squash at home and dressing it up with spices, so I guess I expected a little more. It was bland and grainy. Pass.\n\nThe hubby decided he wasn't hungry so just my father and I ordered soup. I decided on a cup of Cannelini with Kale and my father went with a bowl of Chicken Rice. From here, let's just say the only nice thing about the meal was that it was served hot and fast - go figure, it's a soup restaurant. Both of the soups were, again, bland and absolutely flavorless. The kale was chewy and the broth left a god-awful aftertaste in my mouth. My father's soup was a little better, but still horribly bland. We had to salt and pepper it, which just made it taste like, well, salt and pepper. Both soups were served with small slices of bread and cold butter that was impossible to spread. I enjoyed the bread more than the soup, sadly. \n\nWe ate what we could quickly and asked for the check. $20 for one cup and bowl of soup, with tip included.

A frittata, very small and actually strange as if it might have been cooked in the microwave, need I say more.  Two bowls of soup, one was a bean with kale, unfortunately the beans were not thoroughly cooked and the flavor was not allowed to develop.  The other a red pepper concoction, that another diner suggested, was one dimensional and needed copious amounts of help sprinkled with some love.  \nWhen paying these boutique prices one expects and should get a better quality, culinary creation.  These soups needed proper development and herbal infusions that the kitchen obviously lacks.

The yogurt-based dipping sauce, however, was incredible and really enhanced the dish, although it too was mildly spiced. \n\n3) Vegan combo - We got the chickpeas, red lentils, eggplant, collard greens, and split peas combo, which is technically for one but was definitely enough for the both of us. They are all delicious although, again, not as spicy as I was hoping for (again, tastebuds and sinuses may be at fault). My two favorites were the split peas and collards. The eggplant was not as soft as I like (I only liked eggplant if it is mushy, personal preference), and the red lentils were too sweet. The best part, of course, was the injera on top of which the food was served, when the flavors have soaked into the little pockets. \n\n4) Raw desserts: Persian Cashew Custard and Raw Banana Ice Cream. I'm not a dessert person but Daniel definitely loved them. The texture of the custard was great, very creamy, and I think it had a touch of saffron. The banana ice cream basically tasted like cold banana to me, with a raw chocolate syrup that I really loved. \n\nThe service, by the way, rocked! Marly was so attentive and nice, coming up to us often and ready to answer any question. Admittedly, there were not many other people, but I noticed her giving that same degree of attention to a woman who was clearly a regular. I will definitely be back sometime in the next 3 weeks that I'm stuck here in Tempe, to enjoy the excellent food, ambience, and company.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Be warned: this place hasn't updated their store hours. My girlfriend and I went on a Sunday looking for one last place to eat before I would have to leave Arizona and the store sign said they weren't open until 12pm, when in fact, they actually opened at 11am. We only found out of their actual business hours by calling the restaurant and by then we had spent almost an hour waiting at a Del Taco across the street eating $.57 tacos. Agh. \n\nGetting into the restaurant, surprisingly, was the least pleasant aspect of the trip. Once we were inside, we were greeted by Marley, one of the waitresses. She was extremely nice and did a great job of making us feel welcomed and was very attentive to possible dietary restrictions - such as veganism(she pointed out which dishes had yogurt in them and provided possible alternatives). \n\nMy girlfriend and I, despite already being half satiated from Del Taco, were enticed enough by the menu selection to go ahead and order more than a full meal. We got:\n\n1. Potato and Collard Sambussas - The skin was thinner than most sambussas I've had(which isn't a bad thing - in fact, I enjoyed it very much) which, as a result, gave the sambussa a very nice crispy outer layer. The filling was on the milder side but went very well with the spiced yogurt sauce that was provided for dipping. \n\n2. Vegetable Combo/Platter -\n - Eggplant - It's a bit tangy and some bites didn't taste like eggplant\n - Red Lentils - Surprisingly sweet - I definitely enjoyed it\n - Yellow Split Peas - This dish was also more on the sweet side - enjoyable\n - Collard Greens - Not bad but not great - more spices please!\n - Spiced Chickpeas - Probably the most spiced dish we got which is a good thing\n\nMy main complaint is that the dishes were far too mild for my taste. I wish they had more spice! \n\nThe restaurant, on certain days of the week(only two, I think Wednesday and Sunday?), offers a special raw foods menu. Like most raw foods, it's definitely on the pricey side and portions take a noticeable cut. We got two desserts:\n\nBanana Ice Cream Sundae - The ice cream was nice and refreshing - not overly sweet though at times I felt like we were just eating mashed up frozen banana. The raw chocolate sauce was the real star. It has a very distinct nutty taste that chocolate syrup normally doesn't have. I can see how it is probably a hate-it-or-love-it kind of thing but I absolutely enjoyed the sauce. \n\nChai Custard - This was my favorite dish here. Too bad I didn't have enough room to finish it. The texture was incredibly smooth and provided wonderful tactile sensations to my tongue as I ate it. No one spice was overpowering and I could taste all the different spices in the custard(cardamom, chai, cinnamon). Definitely a must try.  \n\nThe prices for the food were decent. It was $8.95 for the vegetarian platter which came with a good amount of injera - we definitely left stuffed. The raw foods, on the other hand, are much pricier. The custard itself was $7 - almost the cost of the entire vegetarian platter. \n\nThis restaurant would be great for people with low tolerance to spicy food, but for me, I prefer a lot more kick in my food.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 3, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "On Sunday and Monday they have a Raw menu and I highly suggest you give it a try.

Getting off track...I prefer the Blue Nile Cafe for three reasons: Kay Seer Salad (beet salad), Shuro Watt (ground chickpeas with spices) and the House Iced Tea. \n\nThe Kay Seer Salad is perfect - I have tried to recreate it, but can never get the perfect blend of beet, spice, and citrus tang.

It looks like mush, but you can never trust the appearance of the food to describe how it will taste. Just stick your nose over it and you'll be convinced. (Is that a hint of cinnamon? Maybe nutmeg? It's heaven, whatever it is.) I always, ALWAYS get the Shuro Watt when I eat here. ALWAYS.\n\nAnd there is nothing that compliments a meal better than a perfect cup of tea.

Maybe a year or two.  I remembered thinking that this place was not very good flavor wise compared to Cafe Lalibela so I have been going there instead.  However, I had a coupon and was craving Ethiopian food, so my husband and I thought to give this place another try.   So glad we did.  I'm not sure if there is a new cook in the kitchen, if it is under different management,  or if my memory just isn't that great, but things seemed a bit different from what I had remembered..and definitely for the better.   For example, they now seem to have a raw food menu, which I don't recall them having back in the days and their regular menu seems more extensive than before, allbeit a little confusing sometimes.  For example, the non-vegan entrees come with your choice of two veggie sides (from the vegan menu) but that is not stated on the menu.  Nor is it stated on the menu that the veggie sides one chooses from for their meals are listed under vegan entrees since these  \"sides\" may also be served as entrees.  It makes sense, but all this is not readily apparent when you just look at the menu.  \n\nThe food was excellent.  My husband and I both got the Blue Nile Messob, which is a combination plate that includes a half portion each of beef tebbs and chicken doro wat, and three full portions of any veggie side.  My husband had the tikil gomen (cabbage and potatoes), a lentil side I can't recall the name of, and one other side which I also forgot.   (I was too engrossed in my meal to pay attention to his).  LOL.  I had the gomen wat (collard greens), begerden (eggplant), and duba (yellow squash).  Each side was not only full of flavor, but also had their own distinct taste and texture.  My husband commented on how he preferred Blue Nile to Lalibella, because at Lalibella a comparable dish would have sides that kind of run together in flavor and texture.  I think I would agree with him to a certain extent.  Not necessarily in flavor, but definitely in texture.  The veggies and such at Lalibella are, I believe, put through a food processor and so the natural texture of each veggie is lost.  But at Blue Nile, the veggies are instead chopped into small pieces.  A small difference, but it does change the experience of the food.  \n\nWith the coupon (20% off) we spent about $26 including 2 non-alcoholic drinks and a 20+% tip.  \n\nI can't say whether or not Blue Nile is better than Lalibella.  They both seem to have their pros and cons, which don't necessarily have to do with the food's flavor, but more so personal preferences on texture, price (Blue Nile is a bit pricier than Lalibella), and types of offerings (Blue Nile seems to have a more extensive menu than Lalibella).\n\nOpen 7 days a week from 11 am - 10 pm.\nLunch specials on week days from 11 am - 3 pm.\nSundays and Mondays they serve raw and organic food, as well as their regular menu.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "We come here a lot for lunch.

Green. Green is open on Mondays! (BUT NOT SUNDAYS) And til 9! Its 7:15-lets get our asses movin'!\n\nSmack inbetween major traffic lights (thus hard to cross), we found a full parking lot and an empty bike rack...sweeeet. Just about every table was full with a pretty diverse crowd-mostly hip, but everyone was real casual and didn't have their Scottsdale poker face on. I was confused when we first walked in-do we get seated? I stared and smiled at one woman who I thought was a waitress-but then she sat down. Whoops. A tad awkward, no? Went to the counter and greeted with beautiful lil menus-they have a LOT of stuff. AND I CAN EAT ALL OF IT.\n\nI am a lactose-intolerant vegetarian. But not vegan. But a vegan diet is the healthiest one for me, obvi. My mind was blown away. Even at vegetarian places I still have half the menu eliminated due to dairy. Only at the Angelika Kitchen in NYC Village am I this over-whelmed. And while Green may not be as healthy-who really cares when its THIS GOOD? I was so overwhelmed I just went for the Argentian sandwich-fake beef strips with hot sauce and fake cheese added WITH a choice of sides for 6.50? That is VALUE. I opted for the fountain soda (their unsweetened iced tea is a good deal), but I saw they have Virgils' Root Beer, the best root beer on earth after Stewarts-and will totally get that next time. \n\nWe sat down in the somewhat dimly lit room-it is kind of industrial feeling, but not hippy at all-but not overly chic at all. Reminds me of a cross b/w Orange Table and Lux in terms of ambiance with the casualness and hottie factor of Pita Jungle. There were multi-coloured car doors lined up on the far wall of the restaurant and the noise level was cordial. We got our Crab Cream Puffs first-ooooooommmmyyyygoooood. For like 3 something, I was in a very special place. I didnt even know you could do that with tofutti cream cheese! Amazing with a sweet tangy sauce. Our food came pretty quickly and I got to have my thyme fries with a side of Vegannaise. My sandwich was HUGE and for no other ways to describe it as BANGIN. I miss Philly Cheese Steaks-and this is my happy replacement! \n\nThe owner ended up talking to us and I asked about the soy ice cream-they were out of cones which made me inexplicibly sad. He said they do Soy-namis, which are their version of Dairy Queen's Blizzards where they made a thick shake with goodies added in. I walked back up to the counter and had trouble figuring out what I could possibly add to my stomach so I didn't keel over in a food coma off my bike on the way home. I went for the super sweet and did like a sundae in a cup with newmans chocolate oreo things and chocolate sauce with cherries. It was amazing. It was like 3.50 and it was too much for us 2 to share...but that doesn't mean we didn't finish it.\n\nI can't believe it took me this long to come here-the atmosphere, options and the cheapness of the food shocked me.

The hot-wing po'boy, however, seemed to have stolen ALL of the flavour and spice from the Texas. *Very* hot (I enjoy heat, so it was fine for me, but I caution more sensitive buds), and too greasy for my taste.\n\nBut the pizza was the BIG misfire. I had heard good things about the type of vegan cheese they use, so I definitely wanted to try that while we were in town. My mistake. I just have to face it. I am NOT into the melty-cheese thing (all of you dairy-dos are rolling your eyes...yes, I get it, the big 'duh' for the vegan girl). Horrible texture, taste and ALL too much of it. (Omni-mum agreed). Even scraping it off, the taste lingered. The sauce was nice, but the mushrooms and onions, again, were too oily, and the veggeroni was just store-bought yuck. (I was hoping for some home-made-less-processed seitan or something). The crust was just a thin flat-bread, which I do not like for pizza. The sauce was tasty...but too thinly spread (and affected by the yuck cheese).\n\n +1 star for free fresh fruit substitute:: Seriously, how many times do you have to give a kidney in order to get some fruit or veggies subbed for a side? Thank you, Green, for being reasonable.\n\nSo, do the math and you have 4 stars. Seriously, the Tsoynamis did all of the work on that one. I am tempted to advise Green to just shut down the food side and roll out the Tsoynamis non-stop. However, my mum really liked the fries. \n\nNext time we are in Phoenix, we will definitely go to Green again, but only for Tsoynamis...and maybe fries.

The fries are brittle and tasteless; the chili is pretty good, but could use more spice. The chicken parmesan is too chewy for my liking. I find that the sauces are generally pretty good, but have a hard time with some of the food's textures - the wings are a great example of this. Overall, Green has a vast selection as far as different food types go - great for veteran vegans who don't find a lot of dining options in the Phoenix metro area - but ultimately, to conserve costs, uses low-grade material in many of their dishes.

While it's still not food that I would go out of my way for, I appreciate the level of quality Green offers. \n\nI decided to take an adventurous route and try the original \"g\" spicy po-boy. I consider this adventurous because the idea of mock chicken doesn't sit well with me. The real thing tastes better and the health differential is open to debate. The sandwich was decent but small. It's only a po-boy in spirit. If you've ever been to New Orleans and had a po-boy, you'd know that they are obnoxiously oversized and stuffed with lettuce, tomato, and your choice of fish or meat. What saves this sandwich is the sauce. It's perfectly hot and the tofu absorbs all of its wonderful flavor. I like that Green uses mixed greens instead of iceberg lettuce. It may take away the crunchiness, but I like the taste much better. Green also goes light on the mayo, which I appreciate. The thyme fires are really good. They're thin and crispy, and the herb really enhances the flavor. They give you a lot of fries, which makes up for the sandwich being a little undersized, but I'd rather have more sandwich than fries. \n\nSince heaven forbid I be strong enough to pass up on sweets, I also tried a peanut butter chocolate bar. Not bad. But certainly not worth its $3 asking price. It reminds me of a store-bought peanut butter rice crispy treat. I recommend only having this if you are a strict vegan. \n\nThe restaurant is exactly what you'd expect it to look like. It's dark and artsy in a hipster bohemian style that you'd find in New York's West Village. It's semi-service. Order at the counter, wait at the table, and someone brings you your food. Green may want to look into assigning their customers a number, or a pager, to place on the table. Even though I was taking my order to go, I'm not a big fan of someone walking around and yelling names (way too fast food for me). They also may want to put their menus out near the front the place.

I ordered a veggie burger (of course), my wife got a meatball po' boy, and my daughter got a rice bowl of some type.  There were also some appetizers such as egg(less) rolls, and their chili fries.\n\nChili fries--I looked forward with great anticipation to these, and it looks like I expected too much.  What passes for \"chili fries\" here are shoestring potatoes lightly sprinkled with thyme (not bad in themselves) which are then covered with a concoction of what appears to be Morningstar Farms veggie crumbles mixed with tomato sauce and one or two spices which I couldn't identify.  It was really not all that good.  It tasted like someone was trying to doctor up veggie crumbles and really didn't know how.  I'll say this much--it wasn't \"chili\" in any capacity that I would recognize.\n\nIn terms of the burger, I think that, at least at first, they did a good job of masking the blandness of the the red bean patty at the center.  The presentation and appearance was pretty nice.  However, by the time I took my last few bites, I was needing to wash it down with my Diet Coke.  Again, it was a not very successful attempt to make a meatless food attractive, hip, and tasty.  You can do it if you know how.  I'm not sure if the folks in the kitchen at Green really have a handle on it.\n\nMy wife's po'boy was a similar story.  Again, looked like Morningstar Farms meatless meatballs.  They put them in a bun with \"mum's sauce\" and soy cheese.  I tried a bite.  Tasted like a meatless meatball coated in ketchup on a bun.\n\nThe egg(less) rolls were. . .okay.  Again, there was something missing in the flavor.\n\nThe atmosphere was \"hip\" and cool.  The bathrooms were actually really neat looking.  Service was friendly and helpful.  The food was eh.  Don't be fooled into thinking that because they put up this big presentation and say with fanfare \"WE'RE VEGAN!\" means that the food here is good.  It's really mediocre and the only thing preventing it from being one star in my opinion is the work that they put into decor, atmosphere, and service.

The predominant flavors are salt and oil.   Much of the stuff reminds of foods I would make at home with prepackaged ingredients (especially when tipsy), and it's not the quality you would expect from a highly rated restaurant.\n \nI enjoy pigging out on salty fats as much as the next person (just check out my blood pressure), but I expect more interesting flavors, textures, menu offerings from a vegan restaurant.  And...no beer to wash down the grease?  No!!\n\nHowever, if you want to have a good vegan 'greasy spoon' moment, there's slim pickings around here.  So I have been here several times, and have concluded that the best things on the menus are the fries, buffalo chicken, and salads.\n\nSTARTERS\n\nChili Fries - Mushy, greasy, soggy.  The sauce tasted sweet and somewhat ketchupy, with rubbery soy crumbles.  So salty my mouth burned.  I still finished the plate, though.\n\nCrab puffs - Again, a bit greasy, but that's to be expected.  You can't really *not* enjoy the taste of salt and grease.\n\nSamosas - Dry/crumbly inside and not as flavorful as I had hoped for.  Nothing that could compete with an Indian restaurant's offerings.\n\nHummus - I found the hummus bland and the pita dippers almost institutional.  One item on the menu that isn't soaked in grease, and it's flavorless - really illustrates how much Green relies on salt/fat to season.\n\nEggless rolls - Nothing special.  You could get these anywhere.\n\nENTREES\n\nRanchero salad - I enjoyed the vegan ranch dressing and the combo of chicken texture with the salad greens.  The buffalo wings had a good meatiness and an excellent sweetish vinegary sauce.  Not a healthy salad at all, but tasty.\n\nMeatball po-boy - I ate the whole thing, but it isn't remarkable.  Plain white sub bread (perhaps a bit stale), standard tomato sauce, and what seemed like premade (not house-made) soy meatballs.  Similar to a bag of Veggie Patch or Nathans.  A generous smear of vegan cheese.\n\nMexicali Burger - Ew.  I couldn't finish this.  The patty was bland, mushy, wet, and had the consistency of pre-chewed bread bits.  No thanks.  Perhaps if they cooked it longer and crisped the outside, it would be better.  The \"nacho cheese\" sauce was just as offensive.\n\nGreen Burger - I tried a bite of my dining companion's.  Soggy again, and she did not finish hers either.  Please, Green - change the burger recipe and preparation.

There is free wifi, a booshelf will all sorts of great reading, and the staff is always super friendly.\n\nAnother great thing about Green is the vegan market. They have all sorts of great vegan foods and books for you to spoil yourself with. It's the only place I know of where you can find Teese, Food for Lovers Queso and Soy Curls. As an aside, I highly recommend Soy Curls as a healthy replacement to the meat in your fajitas or cheesesteaks.\n\nAnother thing you absolutely must check out is their annual ThanksLIVING festival on Thanksgiving.

I was very excited when I saw the website for Green...it really looked intriguing. \n\nWe've been fortunate to have been able to dine in a lot of really, really, good vegan establishments, so we have pretty high expectations. The days when \"vegan\" meant \"bland,\" \"underseasoned,\" \"hippy\" cuisine are long past, or so we thought. I guess there are still some places out there that are stuck in the 70s...definitely Green fits that description.\n\nI was a bit taken aback, after looking at the website and reading about \"Chef Damon's\" vision, to find myself in a tiny hole in the wall waiting in line for counter service, though I could have gotten past that had the food been stellar. I was further taken aback to discover that the place apparently doesn't have a liquor license...the only drink alternatives were bottled and cannned sodas from the cooler and a couple of fruity iced teas.\n\nStill, if the food had been good...\n\nI ordered something that isn't on the on-line menu. It was described as blackened faux chicken in a grilled pita with lettuce, tomato, and tahini. My husband ordered the Argentine Po'Boy with Thyme Fries. We also ordered some samosas to share. We both, reluctantly, grabbed bottled drinks from the cooler.\n\nAlmost immediately after we'd sat down, my sandwich and the order of samosas came out of the kitchen. We waited for a bit, thinking that surely my husband's sandwich would be along shortly, but after several minutes of waiting, tucked into the samosas. They were OK...not bad; nothing to write home about. To be honest, they tasted as if they'd come out of a freezer box. Any Indian restaurant can do them better, and if you don't absolutely have to be dairy free, that's where I'd recommend you go, if samosas are what you're craving.\n\nThe samosas consumed, we sat, and sat some more. My husband finally urged me to get started on my sandwich, which was rapidly cooling, and we both tried a bite of the faux chicken. It was, I have to say, really unpleasant. There was no sign of any blackening seasonings having been used...no sign of any seasoning at all, really. It had an oddly fishy taste to it (too much seaweed in the kombu, maybe?), and was much tougher than most chicken analogs. The pita (which was actually flatbread) didn't appear to have been grilled at all...it was dried out to the point of being crunchy, and there were no grill marks on it at all. The only real flavor in the sandwich (other than the odd, fishy, taste of the analog) came from the tahini. I finally gave up on the whole thing as not being worth the effort of chewing.\n\nMy husband's sandwich finally came out, well after I'd given up on mine. I took a bite of the faux beef, and it was OK. It reminded me of the faux beef strips you can buy at Trader Joes. The fries that came with were nicely crispy (shoestring style), but there was not even a hint of thyme about them. They'd do best to just call them \"French Fries\" and have done with it.\n\nMy take? If you're a vegetarian, you'd do better to eat at Lalibela. If you're a vegan...well, this place will keep you alive, but you'll pay more than it's worth and, if you're familiar with really good vegan cuisine, you won't be happy with it.

We were nice to offer part of our table to another couple that was looking for a seat, but I guess our table was tiny. Luckily it planted a seed and another couple offered them a place at their table that was bigger.  \nBesides the seating and the wait for the food, there was so much that we wanted to try! The spicy edamame was great! I ordered the Curry noodles, they were nice and a great portion! My boyfriend ordered the fake CHicken Parm Sandwich... he liked it and had no complaints.

Living in the city of healthy, organic, locally grown, vegan, gluten free, gmo free, certified rabbit food (aka San Francisco)... I've been to a few of these types of restaurants.  This place has all the healthy entrees one could want without the \"flair\" of a pretentious hipster taking your order.  Best of all everything on the menu looks good.  They simply make things that people like without trying to \"reinvent the wheel\" with some sort crazy food combination/fusion.  I always enjoy eating at a place without having to read some detailed instructions from the chef on how the proper way of eating it should be for the best flavor. (Yes, it's happened)\n\nSince I'm not entirely used to Arizona's 6 degrees hotter than hell heat I have gotten the tsoynamis and their peanut butter and chocolate crack bar.  It's the perfect fix for that sweet tooth craving that I get from time to time, or in this case three or four times this week.  I'm coming back tomorrow for lunch with my beautiful wife and I'm going for the buffalo \"wings\" because they've been calling me day and night.  This place is worth the 673 mile drive and the only bad thing I can say about it is that once I leave this weekend I'm going to crave this place.

I don't go to green when I want to have a salad or cold sandwich because I can make that at home.  This place serves delicious comfort food.  By comfort, I don't mean greasy or fattening, but don't go here if you're calorie conscious.  This is a great place to take friends and family who are not vegan or vegetarian because the food tastes so \"normal.\"  Green has the best mock chicken and mock beef I have ever had anywhere in the country (so far).\n\nAll of the sandwiches/burgers are to die for.  The thyme fries are great but if you want to keep it on the healthier side, go for the tahini coleslaw as a side option--it may be my favorite dish at Green.\n\nBefore I was vegan--more than five years ago--I didn't care for chicken wings but after years of watching other people scarf tens at a time, I grew a desire for them.  I have ordered them in bulk and meat lovers cannot taste the difference.  They are delicious and served with cucumber ranch and veggies.  I think I misspoke when I said the tahini slaw was my fave because I think this one might be it.\n\nI've had the samosas and couldn't tell you anything good (or bad) about them.  They just left me with no impression.\n\nThe bowls are good but simple.  I feel like I can get similar dishes at other places so I would rather have something more exciting.  But if you're in the mood for something like that with the delicious mock meats, go for one of these. \n\nI usually go to Green for its specials, which are posted on Facebook. They've been some of my favorite dishes and are usually delicious! \n\nI have yet to try a dessert because I'm always full when I leave but make sure to try one of the tsoynamis.  They are light and a perfect end to a great meal.  I always get the almond oy vey and substitute the chocolate with bananas.

No such thing. This place was full, busy, and still churning out food like it never had been slow to begin with. That is a great start in my books.\n\nWe (I dragged my fella in tow for this stop) headed up to the counter and grabbed a menu and looked through what to get. When the line moved up and it was our turn we ordered, paid, and took a number to place on a table of our choosing. The staff was pleasant, although fairly quiet, but they moved us along politely and we waited.\n\nWhile waiting for the food, we bought beverages which you can either grab from their fridge, or choose from 4 refillable drinks. We choose the refillable drinks and chugged away.\n\nGreen Tea (strong, deep flavor), Lemonade (mild lemon taste, not a ton of sugar), Limeade with Ginger (lime was a good taste, could not taste ginger), and I believe it is called Virmto (a medium weight beverage tasting like cherries, weirdly addicting, you should have a taste)\n\nThey bring our food and it was filling and just enough for lunch.\n\nSpicy Buffalo \"Wings\" ($5.00)\nFor those that don't like spice this was not too bad. It had more components of vinegar to the spice than actual heat. The \"wings\" were great soy chicken substitutes and I did not miss actual chicken in this. If the tartness of these is too much then go ahead and dunk them in the Vegan Cucumber Ranch that comes with it. It was some yummy ranch!\n\nArtichoke Chicken Salad ($6.00/$9/00)\nWe ended up getting the small salad and that was plenty for him and I to split. There was a Lemon-Tahini dressing that brightened up the greens very well, the salad leaves were dark & crisp, big pieces of artichoke strewn throughout the salad, and again the soy chicken was fantastic. You can tell it is fake with further inspection, regardless it still tastes fantastic (this was also prepared differently than the wings, it was a longer flat pieces where the wings were more like clusters of soy chicken).  \n\nSecret BBQ Chicken Sandwich ($8.50)\nThe chicken is prepared the same way in this sandwich as it was in the salad. The BBQ sauce had a tiny (I mean tiny) kick to it and was slightly messy to eat. Prepare for a burger stance with this one (elbows kicked out, looming over the sandwich aggressively). The Tahini Cole-Slaw was good, but had a lot of tahini and peanuts which overpowered the cabbage for me. The downside to the sandwich was the bun. The bun was a plain burger bun that was slightly stale and not that flavorable. The dryness of the bun against the sticky bbq sauce made a consistency that liked to get stuck in my mouth. Not the classiest thing to fix in front of other people, mind you.\n\nWith eating this food there were people that continued to come and go from the building non stop. The atmosphere is a bit hipster (staff was polite, but other guests really liked themselves and it was obvious) though I saw many suits, parents, and bros hanging out. Good melting pot!\n\nOverall I think this place had great food, cheap prices, manageable crowds, and I could go back easily to try more items.

These soy-based ice creams are light, so Green serves you a very large amount with each order. They have a lot of different every-day flavors, as well as some seasonal ones on a board that they have. I highly recommend the \"Kissed by a rose\" flavor (rose, chocolate, strawberries) if that is up on the seasonal board.\n\n3. Ambiance- Green is such a cute place to come grab lunch or a light snack.

It's nice to have a completely vegan restaurant--I don't have to worry about what I can/cannot eat on the menu! Also, the food tastes like vegetarian food. This could be confusing to meat-eaters, so let me explain; a lot of vegetarian options at places that serve meat are cooked like you would cook meat, therefore the taste is different. It's nice not to be overloaded with spices or sauce just because it's all veggie food.\n\n2. The atmosphere is comfortable. Sometimes the music is a little loud, but it's definitely not as bad as a lot of other places around The Valley.\n\n3. Take Out! This is one of my favorite places to grab food after roller derby practice! It's quick, healthy, and filling.\n\n4. I have a lot of friends that eat meat. Not one of them has said anything negative about the food here. Plus, the people here don't look down on meat-eaters. One of my biggest pet-peeves is when vegetarian extremists think lowly of people that eat meat--you're giving a bad name to us other vegetarians! Calm down!\n\n 5. It's affordable. Yes! Affordable vegetarian food! Amazing, right?!\n\n6. Have a Tsoynami. No, really. Trust me.\n\nPersonally, I think the food tastes better at this location than the 7th Street location.

The counter girl was incredible grumpy, rude, and cold but we left a generous tip anyway being that my boyfriend also works in food service. Upon receiving our wings baskets we were disappointed to find that what is normally a heaping pile of wings was not so heaping; in fact we received only 5 wings each. We asked the staff about it and the girl disinterestedly told us the wings are done by weight so some might be larger and some smaller. I find it hard to believe they've always done it this way since there was a HUGE difference between the amount of wings we've received in the past and the amount we received then. My boyfriend became irritated and the poor service we received because he works in a very high end restaurant where, should any guest complain about anything, the kitchen would be sending them out loads of free food to make up for the experience.

Beware - it's a small space, so if you are going on a weekend, I would call for reservations. \nThe restaurant, located next to the India Plaza on Apache Blvd., is really inviting - it's decorated with bright colors, nice, thick tables and contemporary lights and wall hangings. It has quite a different feel than most Indian restaurants in the Valley. It has fun, upbeat music playing too, although I think it could have been turned down a  *little* to make it easier to talk.\nI loved the menu, because it is quite varied, offering the 'usual' suspects as well as some different items like Goan fish curry, bitter melon curry, goat curries, and gobi manchurian. AND, it also serves chaat. \nMy husband and I, however, decided to stick with the more typical offerings for the night. He got the \"La Jawab Kadahi Gosht\" which was lamb pieces and veggies in a spicy yogurt sauce. It was seasoned really well and delicious. I ordered the malai kofta, which was also delicious and seasoned just perfectly.

We all know the Indian restaurants are terrible in Phoenix in general so the ones that are pretty good deserve higher than normal grades.   Don't get me wrong, my expectations were exceeded when I dined at \"The\" Dhaba.\n\nGuru palace is still better and in regards to food, I would say Royal Taj is slightly better but The Dhaba is a strong 3rd place.  And in terms of the overall total package, I would rank The Dhaba the 2nd best Indian restaurant in the city. \n\nThe ambience reminds me of the contemporary small joints you see in NYC or SF.  The restaurant is narrow yet not claustrophobic. The style is contemporary with nice mood lighting to give it a comfortable 'lounge\" like feel to it.  They have the standard flat screen television with Bollywood playing. There are two servers.  There is a non-Indian server and an Indian server.  Luckily we got the Indian server because the other one just seemed a little strange like the reviewer below said.  I thought the service was pretty good. No, our waiter didn't exchange pleasantries or talk to us but he was efficient. Water was continuously replenished in our cups which was a nice change for an Indian restaurant.   A big hit with me were the plates and cutlery.  They were all metal including the cups which provides an additional authentic feel of dining in India. The water especially tastes cooler when it's served in a metal cup.  And just to avoid confusing people, there are two parts to Dhaba. They have a fast-food like chaat place which is next door to its restaurant component. We dined at the restaurant. \n\nThe food: The food was well prepared. The texture especially was captured right. The chicken tikka masala was creamy and not runny. The quality of the chicken included thick chunks of white chicken breast. The saag paneer had a nice smooth pureed consistency but it wasn't runny.  My favorite aspect was the naan which had amlost a paratha texture to it with flaky layers yet it was baked and crunchy on the outside but wasn't burned. The rice wasn't dry or overcooked like you receive at most Indian restaurants.  In terms of heat, it was perfect. It wasn't too hot or mild. I though they really nailed it there. So what was missing? Flavor.. the food didn't lack flavor but it did lack that addictive quality that makes you want to come back by yourself and just chow down when you just got finished working out for 2 hours. Oh, don't get me wrong, food was tasty and far better than 90% of the Indian restaurants in the valley including some vaunted favorites like Dehli Palace in Tempe, India Palace on 35th and Bell, Tandoori Times and Maharaj Palace to name a few.  The malai kofta was arguably the best in the city  The only weak dish was the saag paneer; yes they got the texture right but it was a bit plain and it could have used more spice.  \n\nSomething that deserves mention was the chaat. We ordered the samosa chaat.  The chaat actually contained normal amounts of samosa as opposed to one small piece of samosa and just tons of sauce. The samosa and the chole were very well prepared and it wasn't drowned in sauce. It was also fairly big and it was more than enough to feed two people.\n\nOther things worth mentioning: we had two white guys playing the sitar and tabla, talk about ironic but the fact is they were really good sothere was a live music component.  The place was also packed and there were people waiting outside to enter which I have never seen at an Indian rest. in the valley  so something is working. Finally, the food was priced fairly. We ordered 3 dishes, 2 naan, 1 rice, 1 appetizer and two soft drinks for $44...not bad for an Indian restaurant..the same would have cost us about $10-$15 at another Indian restaurant. \n\nThis place is worth taking a date to or  a group of friends as it's ambience is hip enough that if you don't like the food, your friends won't think you took them to some cheap restaurant.  In other words, it's a good place to take people who have never eaten Indian food.  My recommendation is that you arrive before 7:30 because after that, the place gets packed.  If you go before 7, the crowd is mostly non-Indians and the date crowd.  After 7, you have large groups of Indian families dining and so the waiting line can be extensive and the tables can get packed.  \n\nMy only criticism (if there is one) is the lack of enough of waiters and the length of time it took to bring the food out. We ordered our food at 7:05 and didn't receive it until 7:40 and the place wasn't busy at the time.

Indian spices are way more than just chili and you can not add / subtract spices like Chili sauce since spices are added during the process of cooking and not on top as garnishing... \n\nIn short, \"Mild, Medium or Spicy\" is like asking what kind of a football player do you want for your team \" fast, faster or fastest \" .. well, quarterback position needs a fast player, tight ends could be faster but wide receivers need to be the fastest... but you can not f* switch and play the game !\n\nAll right... about the restaurant... my opinion is that if you wish to have real Indian food, you have to go to cities other than Phoenix (or even better, go to India... !)... I have been to some Indian restaurants in Houston, Washington DC, New York, San Diego, New Jersey and a few more places and all places have much better Indian restaurants than in our Valley... but if it comes to sticking to the choices we have around, I would rank \"The\" Dhaba as the most \"close to actual\" Indian food that you have get...  Jewel of the crown ranks probably the second... but overall, all Indian restaurants around here are good for some particular things on the Menu and worse for others...  Dhaba comes to being better for almost everything on the menu... Chicken tikka masala (butter chicken) related dishes are very good, all lamb dishes are nice and authenticated... vegetarian options are awfully limited compared to what it should be considering its an Indian restaurant... ( common restaurants in India have at least 40 more vegetarian items on their menu, no kidding !)\n\nBut overall I am very pleased with the range of quality here at The Dhaba.. garlic Naan's are way too good to resist... tea (complimentary) is very close to what people in India drink... almost all non-vegetarian dishes and paneer tikka masala or mixed vegetables are tasty... (somebody wrote about salads and I would like to remind that salads are not Indian because other green vegetables are very common in regular diets)...\n\nand yeah... if you like Indian music, they have live music these days on the weekends, I guess... and though I have never been there for the music, I bet that would be cool....", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "After dining here a couple of more times, I would have to give this restaurant 3.5 stars.

The flavor was also lacking.

FYI, Indians from India (my parents) call all white dudes \"Americans\" as if we are not Americans but I thought would throw some humor your way in case you were already bored reading the typical \"The spiciness wasn't there\" review\n\nIn terms of the menu, I don't think Dhaba knows how it's trying to position itself. Are they a chaat house, a classic Indian restaurant, a fusion Indian restaurant....and that is the problem with this place, it's  a smorgasboard...a jack of all trades yet a master of none.  And that's exactly felt in the cuisine. The samosa chaat was amazing, the other chaat....bleh!  The chicken tikka masa was very good but the certainly not crave-worthy meaning  it lacked the\"Hey I'm dying for some great chicken tikka masala, let me order this to go\" quality. It's really hit or miss with their dishes as some are completely amateur like their chicken tikka(not the curry but the grilled version) which tasted like chicken cooked on a Forman grill and was then allowed to cool to room temperature and served on a plate...not exactly appetizing. Their daal was really good but their saag was okay.\n\nAnd to Wendi below, we don't eat salads.  Indian people created salads for you guys.

If the guy is listening to Pink Floyd, that means the dial is moving even further away on the authentic meter. What's next, are they going to start offerring hooka and child's chicken finger and fries plate?\nDon't get me wrong, Dhaba is one of the few Indian restaurants in Phoenix that I will actually dine at since most are terrible and that's not me being critical. Phoenix is a great place for bad Indian restaurants to thirve since the population is clueless when it comes to Indian food and you could seriously serve up some ground beef with curry and give it a name and they would think it's a legitimate and authentic dish...and this goes for the white dudes living in London who comes on these forums and tells us they know great Indian food when they give places like India Gate 5 stars....but I digress. Okay so if you are not an Indian food snob and want to break out of your routine of eating at Black Angus, this is a good place to start.

You see when I order and eat, I'm pretty much a total top. While I am open to suggestion, I have a good idea of what I want and how I want it. During my visit, not only was I flipped but I didn't have much say in the matter. Please don't get me wrong, our server was friendly however, every time when one of us ordered something, he would tell us that he would order something better for us to enjoy. For me, I was dead set on ordering several wraps and rolls called Sada Bahar, what I ended up with was far from what I originally envisioned. While I did get my way with a few appetizers, I have to say not only was I pleased with his domineering ordering selections, but would eagerly let him order again for me.\n\nStreet food called chaat, is to Indian cooking as dim sum is to Chinese. Usually a small plate with around 3 servings varying in preparation, and with enough variety to make a meal out of. Starting with the Amritsri Samosa Chaat ($6); these are a deep fried triangular dumpling filled with a mixture of potatoes, onions and chili, served with a spicy yogurt sauce. Perfectly crunchy and not a drop of oil, just breaking into one of them was a delight as the fragerent steam escaped, it was aromatherapy Indian style.\n\nAmbala Tiki Chaat ($6) was more of a composed small plate. A couple of potato pancakes, layered with garbanzo beans, onions, and garnished with fresh mint & tamarind chutney and yogurt. The flavor components with Indian cooking are generally very complex, this plate was a great example of complexity and harmony. Each bite had varying degrees of spicy and sweet then a slightly sour finish from the chutney.\n\nComplexity doesn't quite work like with the Kolkata Pani Puri ($6). These are round hollows, fried crisp and served with a watery mixture of tamarind, chili and potatoes. The idea is to spoon in some of the mixture into each puri, then pop into your mouth. While the texture was nice, the flavors just never came together and ended up just tasting weird.\n\nThis is the part where he took over and assured us what he was ordering was going to be quite good. As the dishes came out we weren't quite sure what was what, so we just dug in. Eventually we got clarity and just continued to share, family style.\n\nArriving on a sizzling iron skillet covered with peppers and onions, the Chicken Tikka Kabob ($11) was not only a dramatic presentation coming from the kitchen, but the colors were vivid and bright. Large pieces of boneless/skinless chicken breast are rubbed with spices then grilled, resulting in a beautiful yellow color. The chicken was tender and moist yet had a slight smokiness that added another welcome dimension.\n\nServed in a large basket were piles of hot freshly baked naan ($3 per order). The thick and tender bread was a welcome site since I was wanting a wrap to begin with. Plain, garlic and chili each flavor welcomes dipping, wrapping and scooping of sauces and meats.\n\nLoving yogurt, the creamy tang of the Kashmiri Chicken Tikka Masala ($10) was a welcome surprise. This is where the naan really came into play by making good use of the tender pieces of chicken and yogurt sauce. Sopping up as much of the delicious sauce as I could, interactivity is just part of the experience.\n\nWith so many different spices and spiciness, the Mango Lassi ($3) was as welcome as the rain. Yogurt and water mixed with sugar and mango was cooling and refreshing. With the addition of a fruit puree on the inside of the glass, made this version different than others Ive tried, though the effect was still the same.\n\nAt the end of the meal we were brought out a bowl of rice pudding with a scoop of pistachio ice cream. While the sliced dates and papaya were pretty to look at, none of the flavors made much sense together. Complaining aside, this did arrive complimentary. Who knows, maybe for being a good sports?\n\nWe were also brought out another off menu item, it was a thick, flaky and buttery paratha. Similar to a flour tortilla, this particular version was filled with pureed cherry and sprinkled with anise seeds. After only one taste we were hooked. The group of us made short order of the warm tender layers. You might have to ask for this one to be made special. Our server actually told us how soldiers in the hills of Afghanistan, would make these since it didn't take to many ingredients or tools. He stared blankly out the window as he told the story, perhaps of his own personal experience building make shift clay ovens?\n\nAlright, so sometimes letting go can be a hard thing to do.

Well... the place was overrun by a table of about 20... so the service was slow and they ran out of chai, only having enough to give us like half of one glass.

The meat was super tender and the curry was great. They also had good basmati rice and garlic naan.

First- and I love this, because I'm lazy- you can make your reservation on Yelp.  Literally three clicks and I had a reservation for four at seven.  Sure enough, our table was ready and waiting for us- and I watched several other parties of various sizes show up and wait at least fifteen minutes to be seated, so I was feeling smug before our lhassi was even on the table.  \n\nService is a little patchy (we had to request water twice, and flag down a waitress for our check) but the food is so dang good I don't even care.  Order whatever you want off the amazing, huge menu- it will be good.  I promise.  My relatives had never had Indian before (I know, I don't get it either) so I steered them toward the traditional favorite chicken tikka masala.  We requested it mild and I think our server translated that, correctly, to \"for old white people.\"  The relatives loved it, and I looooved my kafta, and the fact that when you say, \"I want it spicy!\"  the kitchen makes it spicy!    \n\nThe portions are very generous, which means lots of amazing leftovers to sit in your fridge and get even more spicy depth and flavor over the next day or two.  And the rice pudding- deeelish!  The only thing that I wouldn't rave about was the Masala chai tea, and that's just because I like my chai blend with a little more punch, and this had quite a bit of milk in it.  \n\nThe ambiance is lovely and perfect for a romantic evening, a place to take your folks when they're visiting and you want to prove you're All Grown Up, or an upscale but not crazy-expensive girls' night out.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "We came with a large group and service was sloooow.

They could stand to provide a sharper knife with this item. I was here with my wife and mother-in-law and we all really enjoyed the Nawabi Murg Tikke (marinated chicken cooked in the tandoor).\n\nOverall they serve great tasting food and India themed d\u00e9cor. The restaurant dining area echoed on the inside, which made for an interesting experience. We could literally hear what our neighbors were talking about. While they did have music it could have been a bit louder, felt like we could hear every conversation from all the surrounding tables. and I expect that this could have been overcome with ambiance level music or some interior curtains.\n\nAt one of the shops, we met an interesting and awesome guy behind the counter, my guess is that he's the owner.

Unfortunately it didn't taste like they had done anything to spice it up.\n\nLast, the rice pudding was... ok. However, they apparently leave whole cardamon seeds in there, and I happen to bite full on into one thinking it was one of the nuts in the pudding.\nMy wife had some ice-cream desert that tasted like a Mango Lassie, but it was so rock solid and in a dish that just didn't work. Trying to dig pieces of the ice-cream off ended with the entire puck (that's about what it looked like) flying out of the small bowl they put it in.\n\nOn the plus side, the Garlic Naan was fabulous... in fact we got a second order of it... \n\nAnyhow, I doubt I'll come back here again, especially if I can find a much better Indian place closer to Chandler...", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Mouthwatering and ethnic!!!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "This is by far the best Indian restaurant I have been to in the valley.

Their staff pays attention to the water level of your cup and ensures it is filled. That's an A+ :)\n\nThis time around I tried papadum which is a  starter. It looks like a tortilla but the texture is a light tortilla chip made of lentil powder, rice powder and some different spices. You can practically eat these non-stop! \n\nFavorites/Chicken/Tandoors/Bread/Dessert:\n- Rahon dal tarka which is yellow lentils mixed with different herbs and spices. You can eat this with their saffron cumin rice. \n- Gudaspuri Mutter Paneer which is blended mix of peas and cheese along with the dhaba herbs and spices. Great for trying to fulfill the veggie part of your daily food intake! ;) palak paneer (spinach and cheese) is also good. \n- Gazab Ka Kadahi Murgh which is a BBQ boneless chicken marinated in a spicy yogurt. This is my new favorite dish because it's baked in their clay oven. Once cooked then its marinated in the yogurt sauce and mixed with onions, bell peppers and tomato to create a wonderful sauce. \n- Tandoori Murgh (chicken) cooked in the clay oven paired with onions and a squeeze of lemon. \n- Pani Puri which is small finger foods. \"Street food\"  Little chip-like texture cups filled with potatoes and chick peas. Pour the mint water in the filled cups and add an optional taramind sauce or mint sauce. \n- Garlic Naan is hands down my favorite garlic naan I have tasted!! If you're wanting garlic naan then come here to eat it. It's soft  ,airy, fluffy with the right amount of crispness on the edges and amount of garlic shavings on top! \n- Ras Malai (sweet condensed milk cheese circular chunks) homemade dessert. Think of fresh mozzarella cheese texture. Really soft clean texture mixed in with the condensed milk cream sauce. \n- Halwa which is a Carrot fudge (sweet cooked carrot shavings boiled in condensed milk mixed with hints of pistachios, cashews, and golden raisins. Really innovative for a homemade dessert! \n\nOverall I loved this place because I can always select new dishes as well as favorite dishes to eat and I can always expect great friendly service from their staff.

She did not apologize or even ask what she could get me. She stood there and stared at me. I placed my order and she walked off.

I absolutely HATE when people knock a new restaurant for bad service.

I'd like to preface this by saying there are a few nice, competent, friendly servers there (they're both brunette women - try to sit in their section), but the majority of the servers are just bad. I doubt many of their servers have prior serving experience as many of them only perform one task at a time. Let me explain. We (a group of two) arrived at the same time as the table next to us. The server greeted them, took their drink order, put it in and WAITED AT THE BAR for the drinks to be made before giving them their drinks and making his way over to us. You don't have to be a career server to know that this is a massive waste of time. The restaurant was absolutely empty - dude had two tables - yet he managed to simulate the experience of dining at an overcrowded and understaffed restaurant.\n\nIn addition to the bad service, the food has gotten worse. The vegan carne asada was so ridiculously good the first time I ate at C.A.S.A., but it seems to get drier, blander, and smaller every time we come.

We indulged in sandwiches such as The Fidel, and their amazing OG Burger ... until today. This is their first day of a new menu consisting mostly of burritos. Our lunch party was shocked. Our favorite selections were now gone, and in its place were several burrito choices. My choice was the #11 Chinese Buffet. A burrito with fried rice, spring rolls, and orange fried chicken. Sounds glorious right? The rice did not taste good, and there was too much of it. The orange chicken was good, but I was set off by the spring roles that remind me of the sort you find at the grocery store. The rest of my party of 6 were not impressed by their selections either. The only approval was a co-worker who selected the BBQ chicken with coleslaw and macaroni and cheese. This, is possibly the only edible thing on the menu. \n\nHad they taken contents of the old menu, and put them in burrito form, it may have been acceptable. The Fidel in a burrito?

I opted for both flavors of the vegan gelato. The guy working the counter was really nice. He told us they rotate the flavors about once a month, so they always have something different. The flavors I got this day were pistachio and amaretto chocolate. Both were really good. And I have had REAL gelato before. Like the kind in Italy. And these were just as good. I wont say better because nothing beats Italian gelato, but these were definitely the best vegan gelato I have ever had. I went back a couple of days later and they had a third flavor of gelato out, spicy chocolate. It was definitely spicy. There is no way I could ever eat an entire cup of it. But it was good for a couple bites. I am excited to go back in a few weeks to see what new flavors they have.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Went to check out this new treat place and was completely impressed.....I was like \"Oh hell ya, vegan gelato!!!!\"\n\nFrank helped us out, offering us samples and letting us know what he puts in the gelatos to make them.

I would also recommend their rice bowls as well, so delish (specifically the veggie bowl & bangkok bowl). Also, if you are a fellow tofu fan, you MUST sub tofu in your dish. They grill the tofu, and it is oh so good!

The wraps here are generously filled and could satiate some of the biggest appetites, including my own. \n\nThe Buffalo 66 ($7.25) encompasses everything that you love about eating chicken wings, my favorite. Were talking thick juicy pieces of grilled chicken, shredded carrots, celery and spicy wing sauce all wrapped up in a herb flavored tortilla. One of the things I enjoy most about this wrap is the contrast between the heat from the sauce and the cooling effect of the dressing, spot on in every bite. \n\nOne of the wraps I was most excited about was also the most disappointing I tried. Ordering the Clubster ($7.25) is supposed to get you turkey, ham, bacon, provolone cheese, corn bread stuffing, tomatoes, and lettuce dressed in tomato vinaigrette all wrapped with a wheat tortilla. The problem here was that there were no hints of smoky bacon or savory turkey, just a bland mix of ham, veggies and stuffing. Tearing my wrap open, neither of the two were present as far as I could tell. I'm not writing this one off yet, next time Ill ask them to double check their ingredients. \n\nFor the lighter appetite, I use that term loosely, you could order one of their massive salads.

My husband and I have ordered to-go twice and both times our meals were flavorful, fresh, and super tasty, and the orders were accurate.

I've been pulling myself back here every few months for the last several years, and I've seen employees come and go, the menu change drastically, etc. But this past visit may truly have to be my last. Giving me a totally unrecognizable wrap from the one that I ordered, with a single, finger-nail sized piece of browned avocado, lettuce that literally SMELLED, dressing/tomatoes/onions that I didn't order, and super stale chips.

The seafood really made this dish good though because the noodles and the gravy sauce were just a little disappointing to me.  The noodles weren't as flavorful as the best rad na noodles that I've had.  They also weren't thick, but instead wide and flat.  The gravy sauce was nothing special in particular.

Your orifices will thank you in the morning. And she won't be saying, sorry, lips are aflame, and not from kissing you, either!\n\nThis is located in the Sahara Pavilion on one of the center islands across from Lotus. So pack heat if you plan on exiting late at night. Just kidding, but you may have to fling your number six heat leftovers in some bums' face. See, honey, six isn't so bad after all. \n\nReally folks, this is a rock solid authentic place that serves genuine Thai food. We ordered all the basic Thai dishes. Just to check them out. Because if you can't do up a good Pad Thai, or even a good egg roll, you aren't going to do anything exotic good anyhow. \n\nWord of note, when you enter, ask for a seat on the right hand side. Trust me. But try and stay away from the front wall. Too hot. And don't throw the 15 pound wooden menu. Keep it handy in case a fight breaks out, that way you don't have to find a bottle, you can brain someone with a menu. Makes for a better story as well. \n\nService can be a bit slow to get started, but when you get the appetizers rolling, Oh La La. This is a great place that charges correctly for appetizers. They aren't the $8.95 for two egg roll kind of place. They actually charge a reasonable amount for all their dishes. \n\nWhen we generously dipped our egg rolls into the Horseradish mustard, we both experienced the wave of intense heat that a napalm victim must feel at first. Luckily, I saved my expression until after she took her first bite. I wish I had a camera for the look of searing pain that crossed her eyes. Which was only slightly more intense than the look she then shot me. But I was too busy draining my Sapporo to bother. \n\nOK, so we're Thai lightweights. What Can I say?! \n\nWhat I will say is that the Egg Drop soup was a thick bowl of eggy goodness. Next time, I'll order a half gallon. The Tom Kha Kai was a rich, oily bowl of balanced textures and seasoning. And the soups  were generously portioned. \n\nThe Pad Thai was cut and seasoned to perfection. Noodles not too long, peanuts not too big. With just enough Chicken. It did look a bit yellow though. Strange I came up with that, but Hey, food is a visual experience as well. \n\nThe Curry Duck was delightful, if not too heated. Next time I'll listen to my dear wife. Just like the last time we ate Thai and I said I'd remember then, too. The duck was superb, just enough fattiness to combat the curry. They put in pineapple, my wife hates warm pineapple, but she recognized how well the sweetness balanced off the dish extremely well. This dish was our favorite of the night.\n\nLast thoughts: Be cautious of heat at authentic places. Start safe.

It was pretty good.  Ground chicken with a variety of spices that included mint and fresh red chili (hence the name).  We ordered it mild and BOY was it mild.  I would recommend medium heat. The waitress said mild is about a 4 out of 10 in the heat scale...However, it didn't taste spicy at all.  Wasn't a bad portion either.  It left enough room for two desserts.\n\nWe ordered the banana steeped in hot sweet coconut milk.  Oh how it reminded me of the Vietnamese desserts I had as a child...It made me feel like I was a kid again.  Warm, soothing, rich coconut milk drowned the chunks of firm bananas.  The texture of the bananas were spot on.  It still held it shape and was not at all mushy in texture.  This dessert packed sooo much flavor!  I recommend sipping the coconut milk little by little.  It is REALLY sweet so I feel that's the best way to eat it.  Slow...to SAVOR the wonderful flavors  :)\n\nI ordered the coconut ice cream with sticky rice...and it was absolutely amazing!  The sticky rice was very warm and with the cold ice cream sitting on top of it, it resembled a thai version of warm brownies with ice cream.  Anyways, here's the kicker...the coconut ice cream is HOUSE-made!  Technically, it's not ice cream.  The base is simply coconut milk and fresh coconut water, so the consistency is more icey (kinda reminds me of a sorbet, but not as refined).  I happened to like that it had those larger icicles because it cut through the decadent sticky rice pretty well, very refreshing.  The coconut milk \"sorbet\" had thinly sliced fresh coconut and jackfruit.  I would come back just for this dessert alone.\n\nMinus one star because upon entering the restaurant, they had a board with their specials of the day written on it which included Mango with Sticky Rice.  However, when I ordered it, they said that they weren't serving any because the mangoes they had were not sweet/ripe enough yet.  So, I would suggest not putting something on the specials board when it's not available to order.  But I can't complain too much.

The restaurant did have a table set up for our reservation when we arrived, so that was a good start. The ambiance of the restaurant is relaxing and the noise level while we were there was perfect. In fact, I think we were probably the loudest out of the whole place.\n\nService - It was all over the place. We had two people taking our orders and I think that is where things got weird. We had a friend who came, but needed to leave early so she ordered her food before the rest of our part had even arrived AND she ordered it to go. Somehow between our two servers that was turned into \"She wants an order of shrimp chow mein AND an order of shrimp chow mein TO GO\". Luckily we were able to nip this mistake before it actually happened. And although our servers were attentive, the service was S-L-O-W. As in plates of food came out one or two at a time and there was big chunks of wait time in between people's food arriving. It's one of my biggest pet peeves when a restaurant cannot get a whole party's food out in a decent amount of time. Members of our party sat without food for a good 7 to 8 minutes while others were almost halfway through their own plates. \n\nFood - I had the Kang-Ped Delight with Beef (err, actually with 5 pieces of beef). Although it was really good, I did enjoy it, I was missing the beef! The curry was spot on and their rice was sticky yummy. As always I also had a Thai iced tea and theirs is spot on. Creamy and milky, yet refreshing and served in a very cute glass. I also sampled from the \"Combo Appetizer Plate\" that our group got. I had the BBQ pork, very good; and an egg roll - also good, especially dipped in spicy mustard! We all also shared the fried eggplant, which I felt was okay, nothing special. The ice cream served for my friend's birthday was kind of funky, and I felt as though it was freezer burned. Meh. \n\nOverall - Honest to goodness I don't think I'll be coming back.

We were extremely hungry. When our appetisers arrived we were quite excited with the food displays and they looked enticing.Once my friend bit  on the beef jerky,she said it was quite chewy so tried.It was quite disappointed since the beef  was quite tough like my friend mentioned and it was not that flavourful,but sweet. Then I tried the fish cake,I thought it was a bit better than the jerky.The fish cake did satisfied my palate,but it didn't taste or look like the typical&traditional fish cake at all.\n\nWhen my Pad-Kee-Maw Seafood arrived it is way too oily.I know that stirred-fried noodles supposed to be oily but not that oily.Anyway,it tasted kind of ok.I think it will be more delicious if the restaurant didn't make it so oily.

They never disappoint with food. I love the restaurant itself. And we usually receive top-notch service. Though I have moved further away now...I continuously go out of my way to frequent this gem.\n\nFood: \nThis place has a wide-array of food to choose from. You'll probably notice from other reviews that Komol does have a good vegetarian/vegan selection. I don't mean like 10 choices...I mean pages of vegetarian/vegan options. They have a lot to choose from and with their various serving sizes, from individual to family meals...they can accommodate any group situation.\n\nThere food quality is always top-notch and they're consistent. People like to counter good reviews about Komol saying that Lotus of Siam (in the same shopping center) is better. While I will not deny the quality of Lotus....when it comes to a quality/cost ratio....Komol wins. \n\nPad Thai, Pad Zee Ew, Herbal Salad, Go See Me, Tom Kha and their curries are generally among the dishes we always order. For a taster, try there individual vegetarian meals (which they will make un-vegetarian for you)...you'll get to try appetizers, a soup and a large entree for the price for a great price. Not to mention, they have amazing lunch specials which basically make you feel like you ripped THEM off considering the amount of food you get and what you paid for it. Seriously. \n\n\nAtmosphere:\nThough the restaurant is getting more and more popular, it still has the feel of a quiet little spot. Pictures and artwork on the wall give it a home decor and their carved wood menu holders are an interesting touch.\n\nService:\nTypically, Komol has fast and friendly service. When's it's busy, the food may take a little long but it has never been ridiculous. The staff is willing to offer suggestions and are happy to introduce you to surprise dishes that you might have overlooked in their voluminous menu. Our last visit was a very rare night of bad service....like really bad....but I am going to chalk that up to a new server. If this becomes a trend, I will change my rating.  But, on the whole, all of our visits have been pleasant.\n\nOverall, if you want a great meal, especially with a group that wants to avoid checks that will easily hit the triple-digit mark like at Lotus, come to Komol. Their food never disappoints and you usually leave stuffed to the point of shame.

Following the recommendations of the yelp squad, we quickly made our way over here from the hotel where they were staying.\n\nWhen we arrived here, there was a short 10 minute wait. The atmosphere is very quaint. The first thing I noticed as we were escorted to our booth was that the seats are in desperate state of disrepair. I literally sunk half a foot into them. We received our cool engraved menus and proceeded to order. The suggestions from previous yelp reviews were imbedded into our minds, and helped us tremendously. \n\nFood wise, it was probably some of the best Thai, ever. And I truly mean that.

My personal taste to everything must be either heavily seasoned or a bit on the high blood pressure inducing side and to me this soup was about five shades on the bland side. Now when i say bland i dont mean it lacks flavor it had a bit of flavor from bamboo but lacked the salty and savory punch you only get some fish sauce.

The mock-duck \"meat\" had that taste of duck but it didnt last too long, texture was okay and there was also way too little of it.

Personally i wouldnt order this again and most likely wouldnt order any of the soups again.\n\nWhy? Well for one i'm Viet and i know what these dishes are suppose to taste like to the point where i can try to recreate something with about 75% accuracy if i try it at home. Two in most Viet broths you need animal bones to get flavor, body, and aroma to soups these kinds of ingredients this place obviously cant use. and Three i'm not a vegetarian nor am i trying to be vegetarian i'm just curious to see how skillful this place is in mimicking tofu or mushrooms to resemble meat. Lastly Five, the backbone to most Vietnamese dishes is FISH SAUCE, we'll power our scooters with it and feed our babies with it if we could. This place doesnt use any and could give me an alternative so regardless of how close they can get something to taste like meat it's always going to be lacking that fish sauce.\n\nThe tofu nuggets were complete different. pretty much sliced up tofu served in a sauce that's suppose to mimic a fish sauce caramalization reduction. It had the look and the color but wasnt thick or had that flavor but was good regardless. The tofu was also quite interesting. Between the two commercially known types of tofu (talkin bout silken and firm) this was a type i've never tried before, it was firm yet tender, and had a little play to it. It was close to meat kind of. Sort of like vietnamese fish paste that's been fried (oh gods how i miss fish paste that isnt pre cooked or formed into the shape of a tube...)\n\nAnyway If i'm in the general area i'll come back and give something else a try but it's very not likely i'm going to go out of my way to eat here.

As high-profile as our hotel's restaurants were, the availability of eating options for non-carnivores was lacking. Me being just under a few months old as a vegan, I thankfully was able to trust in my handy dandy Yelp app to locate vegan/vegetarian places in the area and was led to Veggie Delight. At first I was a little confused reading the menu because all over it I read options with the words \"chicken, shrimp, beef, pork\" in them. After looking at the pictures and reading the reviews, I was even more excited to learn of and even more anxious to experiment with several of the meatless options and see their take on carnivorous selections. I was tickled at the fact that it likened many of the Chinese carry outs I'm used to in that they boasted Chinese and American cuisine. Had they've included soul food, I surely thought I was back in Baltimore.\n\nI purchased the Basil Leaf Chicken entree, Spicy Chicken sandwich, Pork spring roll and Shrimp spring roll. My least favorite was the basil leaf chicken. I could barely finish half the container, it had way too much ginger in it. The meat used in it was also not cooked as thoroughly as I would have preferred. It needed to be crisp as opposed to soft and rubbery as the meat seemed to squeak while chewing. My favorite was the chicken sandwich. There's this carrot mixture they use as a topping/spread and the seitan had a nice spicy sauce/marinade that was a great match to the sweet tasting wheat roll the held it together. For the price paid, I would have liked a bit more of the \"chicken\" mixture but if you were eating this with any type of side (chips, etc) you would be satisfied. \n\nAs far as the spring rolls were concerned, what the other Yelpers stated holds true-go for crunchy!!!  The rice paper wrapped round the rolls became sticky and hard to maneuver without everything falling all over the place. It's unfortunate that the shrimp roll doesn't come crunchy. Perhaps some suggestions should be made to them about this. The contents inside were great matches though and the shrimp substitute was delightful. The pork roll had some type of mushroom appeal to it but the color matched and the taste was convincing once you poured the complimentary chili oil on it. \n\nI also purchased an avocado slush and boy was it delicious!

I mean, it was supposed to be Indian Beef Curry, and there wasn't even a hint of hot spiciness, not to mention, the sauce wasn't particularly curryesque either. \n\nJudging from the stacks of magazines and reading material on the shelf by the door, it should be noted that the primary clientele of this restaurant are probably asian buddhist vegetarians.

Easily the worst Indian restaurant in Las Vegas. It is not even authentic Indian food. They try to be cute and make it taste like fusion food, but fail with astonishing zeal. Quoting a Woody Allen one-liner, \"Food is terrible, and portions are so small\". They add gratuity whether you liked the service or not. Way overpriced. Even in more expensive metros like SFO or NYC, you do not have pay this much for a meal at an ordinary shopping strip Indian restaurant. It's no Gaylord India or Bombay Palace (Wilshire Bvld Beverly Hills), yet costs so much. What gives? The owners (husband and wife team) serve customers sometimes. They are curt and glum. A less forgiving person might think these folks are just plain rude. Hope this review is helpful. Cheers!\n\n\nWould not go again  05/12/2006 Posted by pzippy1\n\nI was really excited to find that Samosa Factory was so close by. I called and ordered and drove down to pick it up. I ordered enough for dinner and leftovers for the next day. The manager was very nice when I picked up the food. When I got home, I was more than disappointed. The samosas were edible but barely. Though I must say the chutney was rather good. The lamb korma was not good. The naan was pretty good. But the worst was the spinach (saag) paneer. To say it was an atrocity would be a compliment. I had one bite and couldn't stomach anymore. It was awful. I finished the samosas and the naan and little rice and threw the rest away. If you are looking for good indian in Las Vegas, keep looking, because this isn't it. \n\nAVOID IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The owner refused to give an extra plate to my husband to share the rice pilaf, he wanted us to dig in the servers plate . apart from that the food was horrible !!!! . It looked like the food was days old, we got a stomachache after eating that. The gratuity is added on check, even if you do not want to leave a a tip after a horrible service.

If one is looking for a good indian food ,this is not the right place. Owner behave very rudely especially who are new to the place. We noticed that he behave politely who are his frequent diner.

The food was terrific, the service outstanding, and the waitress, Katie, was friendly, helpful, and attentive.  Just as important, we were made to feel welcome, by her, as well as by the owner.\n\nWe started with veggie samosas.  I love them, but don't often order them, because they're usually heavy and greasy.  Not here.  The pastry covering was light and flaky, the filling was fresh and delicious, and it was one helluva stuffed samosa.  The accompanying coriander sauce was the best I've ever had, and the chutney had a deliciously different taste.\n\nWe had Chicken Tikka, which was cut in bite-sized pieces and mixed with green and yellow peppers, onions, and an assortment of flavorful spices.  The dish was brimming with flavor, and happily, it didn't have the overwhelming heaviness that I always dread at Indian restaurants.  My nit with this dish is that we were sharing it, so presenting it on a small, flat plate made it a bit difficult to transfer to our own plates. \n\nWe also shared a Chicken & Spinach Curry.  I hesitated before ordering it, expecting the spinach to be drowning in cream and ghee.  It wasn't.  And the cubes of chicken were the most tender I've ever had.\n\nThe Onion Nan had an abundance of onion and again, was lighter and less greasy than I expected.  We also ordered a side of Raita.  I was intrigued by the description, which said that the yogurt was mixed with Granny Smith apple.  Hmm, different.  And it was; the apple added a slight sweetness, and was the perfect complement to the tanginess of the yogurt.  It was the outstanding accompaniment for the Chicken Tikka.  \n\nThe Mango Lassi was great, too.  (Be aware that the restaurant has no liquor license.  But if you must drink, you can get sloshed before or after at PT's Pub a few doors down.  I suspect Kristin B. did just that before writing her ridiculous non-review).\n\nThe entrees were served with rice; the menu had the word \"pilaf\" blacked out, and the rice was plain, white rice.  This was a first for me, and it didn't make me ecstatic:  I missed the grilled onion and great flavor that a good rice pilaf - with basmati rice - should have.  \n\nBut this is a small price to pay for a wonderful dinner that will otherwise please your palate, and not make you feel as if your Fat and Calorie Quota has exceeded the National Debt.  \n\nAll in all, this was a memorable meal, and one that we look forward to repeating very soon.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I'm a huge fan!

The good news: I wasn't on the strip. The bad news: The temperature at our hotel near the strip was averaging 106 degrees. The good news: It was somewhat cooler at Red Rock Canyon. The bad news: We were hungry and had about a thousand miles of suburbs between us and that Indian restaurant I was meaning to try I'd seen advertised at every bus stop in town. The good news: We never made it to that place...\n\nOkay. Enough news.\n\nAbout halfway (or more) back to the strip from Red Rock Canyon my stomach stopped grumbling and started screaming at me to eat. \"Now!\" Whenever my stomach gets louder than the voices in my head I start to get worried. I was scanning the restaurantscape through Las Vegas' suburbs for anything that wouldn't have gluten in it. (Hi there. In case we haven't been introduced, I'm Silly Ack. I don't eat gluten.) Continuing down Charleston I considered my options. KFC...nope. IHOP...nope. VI...nope. DD...nope. DQ...um, maybe after dinner. Nobody in the suburbs has time for restaurants with actual names anymore. We only get initials now.\n\nI dodged (or in my case, Toyotaed) South to Sahara and continued East figuring Mr. Stomach would just have to wait till we got to that Indian place across town. Note to celiacs, Indian places are notorious for not having gluten in most of their entrees. Not to mention Indian food in general's pretty damn yummy anyway. Just ask your waiter for gluten-free options. If the restaurant 'gets it', they'll be very helpful. If you get a dumb look instead of helpfulness, back away slowly. The restaurants actually cooking their food fresh and not getting spice mixes and prepackaged ingredients will point out all the entrees without gluten and point you away from things like breads and samosas...\n\n\"Did I just see the word Samosa? That sounds Indian!\" I skidded my rental car around a full one eighty and hammered it back to Samosa Factory. Thanks, Hertz! ...like it's on rails. \"Forget about that other Indian place, this looks like an Indian restaurant and it's right here in front of us which makes it the best Indian place in town!\"\n\nThere was no buffet, an immediate brownie point for the Factory. I respect a place that makes me order from a menu so they can cook it up fresh. I was already ignoring the menu's samosas even before our helpful waiter told me to avoid the samosas along with the other gluten ruined food. It's a bummer not being able to try their namsake, kind of like being a vegeterian in a steak house, but I probably wouldn't have gotten samosas anyway. So there. Instead we got Chicken Tikka Masala, Aloo Gobi, and Okra. I think some places call the okra dish Bhindi Masala which sounds like it's got a lot more to it than just okra. SF's (Samosa Factory, not San Francisco) Okra's got a lot more to it than just okra, so to avoid confusion I'll call it Okra (Bhindi Masala), or, since we're in the suburbs, SF's (SF n SF) O (BM).\n\nOur entrees were mind blowingly tasty. Spiced about as medium as we'd hedged on when ordering them. Whether you want no spice or burn your face off hot, they'll oblige. Just be specific when you order. The only problem was that there was not enough rice so the end of each entree ended up flying solo on our plates. A rather soupy, saucy solo. As an encore we had Kheer, which is rice pudding. I guess we still had rice on our minds after not getting enough rice with dinner. It was good, but I have to admit after having Kheer at Punjab (a SF (not SF but SF) restaurant where they load their kheer up with huge amounts of cardamom, pistachio and almonds) I found it a little bland, like rice pudding. Admittedly Samosa Factory's kheer is probably how proper kheer should taste so I'll shut up. (psst, hey chef at SF (not SF)...try the kheer at Punjab next time you're in SF (not SF).) The good thing is after all that great Indian food for dinner and dessert there was no more stomach screaming, and it was in no way necessary for us to turn back West toward DQ.\n\nWe did, however venture back out to Samosa Factory the next afternoon just to make sure it was really as good as we thought it was. It was.\n\nI have been to vegeterian Indian restaurants (reader, meet my review of Masalaa, My review of Masalaa, this is my new friend, reader) and have been to many omnivore Indian restaurants, all of which had vegeterian sections on their menus (because there's a lot of vegetables in India, silly), but I've never been to an Indian restaurant that seperated their vegeterian section into \"Vegeterian\" and \"Vegan\" sections. Pretty smart and cutting edge. I think these guys are on the technological forefront of U.S. style (not U.S. but ...oh, never mind!) Indian dining.

The gentleman that greeted us was accommodating in bringing tables together for us, however, it seemed like he had expected us to call ahead and made a comment about our group size, adding that it was a good thing it was early (5 pm). We thought this was odd given the \"no reservations\" situation.\n\nWhen most of our group arrived, we were approached by the same gentleman to take drink orders. Then, when we had everyone, he came to take our appetizer order. Since I was at the other end of the table near the kitchen, I couldn't hear him, nor did he make an effort to be heard (he stood at the end of the table and didn't bother coming around or closer to the other end). He didn't smile once, he was lukewarm, and seemed bothered. He acted the same way as our evening continued, seeming unhappy to even serve us. We didn't feel very comfortable or welcome. The same gentleman was very warm and friendly to a couple that sat down at the table next to us, even sitting with them for a moment, so it was apparent that he was capable of these positive behaviors. It was just odd. There was another young woman that assisted us as well and thankfully, she was kind.\n\nFood-wise, my fianc\u00e9 and I ordered Lamb Samosas, Garlic Naan, and Butter Chicken (Makhani). We also tried the Tandoori Chicken, Lamb Korma, and Quesadilla Naan from our friends. Everything was okay -- unimpressive and not as good as what I've had at other Indian restaurants. I was really disappointed with the Chicken Makhani because that's one of my favorite Indian dishes and this version didn't do it any justice. Also, I wasn't wow-ed by the samosas or the chutney. The Quesadilla Naan was surprisingly good and I liked the Tandoori Chicken.\n\nUnfortunately, my experience wasn't a good one with disappointing food and service.

My friend ended up ordering a jillion empanadas, pastry puffs, buckets of bean salsa, and cupcakes for her cocktail wedding reception. At said reception, the guests had no idea the food was even vegan but very  obviously enjoyed every single meat-less bite. By the time I even got to dessert, a friend had to force-feed me half of one lemon cupcake and half of a chocolate cupcake (my fav, btw) because they were just too good NOT to eat; even if my entire body had to shut down to digest all of that delicious food.\n\nIf the idea of vegan food excites you about as much as a slab of cardboard with a side of newspaper mush, then Pura Vida will certainly change your carnivore ways. There is something about the spices Chef Mayra has so effortlessly conquered that really work in such a way that you forget you're not eating meat/processed foods, but instead fresh and eco-friendly meals that just make you want to throw your head back and praise the vegan gods.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 4, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "As a first time Vegan eater I was delighted by the tastes and textures as well as the variety available.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I have never really eaten vegan foods until recently.

I will never go here again. \nWe went for brunch on a Saturday morning two weeks ago. We were sat at 10:50am. We waited on our server for a while before we could order at 11:05. I wanted to order an item that wasn't available until 11:30, but I was told that I could not. I told our server (whose name started with a J and contained some 'e's) that I wanted exactly the short stack with berries that was featured in a picture on the menu. \"Is that the short stack?\" I asked. She said, \"Well, the short stack has 6 pancakes.\" I said, \"Yes, and the picture has 6 pancakes, so it's the same, right? It comes with berries?\" Server: \"Sure.\" Me: \"Ok, I want it just like the picture.\" Not too confident that she really knew the menu. My husband ordered a 3-course brunch meal with a wrap, soup, and salad. \nMeanwhile, another table had sat down near us. They ordered, from our same server, at 11:20-- 15 minutes after us-- and the server told them that they COULD order off of the post-11:30 menu. Wow. I could have waited 10 minutes if I'd known that was the difference... in the end, I ended up waiting over an hour for our entrees, anyway. The soup came out fairly quickly. We waited another 25 minutes for the salad. Meanwhile, the table next to us was receiving their food more quickly than ours-- brought out personally by the chef herself. The chef passed by our table and only smiled, never stopped or spoke to us. \nOur server came by again and  asked confirming our wrap order, except she asked me about it, completely forgetting that my husband ordered it, not me. Even later, she came by again and said, \"Let me check on your entree order\". Even later than that, she came by and said, \"It should be 5 minutes, the chef said.\" During that time, the chef brought out a complimentary sample dish of apple dessert to the table next to us.  Then our waiter came back, 5 minutes later (when our entrees should have arrived) and brought us the same dish of apple dessert, because, in her words, \"sorry for the delay; here is something that the chef is working on.\" \nIt was only at 12:25 that we finally received our entrees. Completely inexcusable. The table next to us received theirs less than a minute after us, yet they ordered more than 15 minutes after we did. AGain, the chef brought out their entrees. They were the only table that received visits from the chef even though their server was actually our server. It seemed completely fishy to me.\nAfter we'd finished our entrees, a different lady (working the register) came over to our table and asked if our food was ok. She must have seen that we'd been there an hour and a half. She did not offer us anything or offer to discount our meal or anything. Neither did our server. Or the chef. Instead, when we received our bill, I was charged an extra fee for adding berries on the short stack. They were not even good. And, there were only 2 rasberries, the rest were strawberries. In the picture, there were raspberries, blackberries, blueberries. \nWe were planning to come back there every day that we were in LV because the desserts looked so good and we were excited about the food.

I would love to see more veg-friendly and all-veg restaurants in this town.  I make sure to thank the ones that I visit for thinking of us when planning out their menu.   But my experience at Pura Vida was not pleasant and I've had better vegetarian food elsewhere.\n\nThere were a good bit of customers at the restaurant when we arrived for a late Sunday brunch, but the place wasn't packed.  We were seated quickly and I started off with an apple agua fresca to drink.  It tasted like water with a splash of apple juice thrown in.  It was barely tolerable to drink.  Although a roadblock, I didn't let it get me down and still kept my hopes up for a good meal.\n\nWhile looking at the menu, I noticed what another reviewer below had said: there is a lot of soy and starch.   I was honestly expecting a lot more veggies on the menu.  Well, whatever, it was brunch and I usually get starchy things anyway.  So I ordered the The Latin'Tude burrito combo meal while my husband ordered the The Dark Choco Waffle.\n\nThe wait for our food was pretty long, especially considering the place wasn't at capacity.  While waiting, we ended up noticing that the restaurant didn't look terribly clean.  The table seemed pretty dirty as well as the wall we were sitting next to.  Not a good thing to be looking at while you are waiting around for your food.\n\nFirst they brought out my chips and salsa.  The chips were the absolute bottom of the bag teeny-tiny broken up bits of chips that are impossible for dipping in anything.  Being a small place, I felt bad asking for new chips and used what I had as best as I could.  The salsa that came with the chips was a \"warm salsa\" and tasted exactly like black bean chili to me.   It wasn't bad, but not at all what I was expecting.\n\nFor my next course I had a salad with a citrus dressing.  It was leaps and bounds better than everything else I had up until that point.  The veggies were fresh and the dressing had a nice light taste.  There were edible flowers and even some corn shoots in the salad that made it pretty to look at.\n\nMy burrito was good.  It was presented nicely and even though there were a lot of ingredients, everything blended nicely.  With all the soy and potatoes, it filled me up quickly.  I do think it could have used some more vegetables and the fake cheese wasn't really necessary at all.\n\nMy husband's chocolate waffle was good- if you like eating dessert at any hour of the day.  I was thinking it would be a waffle (crispy on the outside with a warm doughy inside) with some cocoa in the batter.  It, however, was a chocolate cake in the shape of a waffle.  Literally imagine a chocolate cake the size of a large dinner plate and you will have the consistency of this waffle.  It was super rich and had waaaaaaay too much cocoa.  To top it off, it was covered in chocolate chips and chocolate sauce (want some chocolate with your chocolate?).  He was pretty disappointed with his meal.  I took a few bites and it hurt my stomach.  This is a dessert, not a breakfast item.\n\nAfter immediately leaving, I considered giving this place 3 stars since my salad and burrito were good and we had a friendly server.  But about 10 minutes after that initial thought, I started to get a really nasty stomachache with cramps.  It was around 1 or 2 in the afternoon when we got to the restaurant and it was the only thing I had eaten so far that day.

I can get behind that.   But as one of my close vegan friends told me, the biggest problem with the growing number of vegan restaurants is that they tend to be run by vegans but not by business people so they do not know how to properly run a restaurant and oftentimes feel like by just existing they are somehow doing you a favor.\n\nSimply put, waiting 2+ hours for food is unnacceptable, especially when no one alerts you to any delays and food shortages they are experiencing.  And this restaurant is very small, inside holds less than 20 people and there are outside tables for another 8.  so at full capacity it holds less than 30 people and when we were there they were not at full.\n\nThe chef had a condescending attitude towards my friends who inquired politely where the food was, and tried to somehow pass off that it's normal to wait 2+ hours for your food??!! WTF?!!\n\nLong story short, half of our party got our food, the other half did not while we were there.  The restaurant was finishing up 2 of the orders by the time we left so they packed it up and gave it to us for free, but the ironic thing is the one person who never got any food ordered the simplest easiest quickest thing to make on the menu. Pancakes!\n\nSpeaking of the menu, when the waitress comes and says she needs to explain it, you know you're in trouble.  No menu should require explanation, that means it's too convoluted and needlessly complicated.  Personally I didnt think it needed any explanation, tho it was quite large, and maybe they would  be better served editting it down to half the items, do them well, and get it out to the tables in a timely manner.\n\nI felt bad for the waitress since she seemed frustrated too, BUT at the same time she is the liason between our table and the kitchen, so where was she in being proactive about getting our food prepared. Also in 2+ hours she NEVER refilled our waters.  Sure we could have asked for refills, but really, at that point we really shouldnt have to ask.\n\nAs for the food itself?  Nothing great going on.  We've had much better vegan food elsewhere that employed finesse and technique and managed to be full of flavour.  Our soup was very bland and needed a lot of salt to get it edible.  Our cheesy potatoes could have been good, but the potatoes were not cooked all way thru so a bit hard.  We must have literally gotten the last half of potato since our other friends who never got their meal was because of running out of potatoes.  Our quesadilla was ok, but the basic point of a quesadilla is tortilla and melted gooey cheese inside, anything else is an afterthought.  Almost no cheese, just a bunch of veggies stuffed into a tortilla.  The grilled cheese we got was really good tho.  The vegan cheese melts and has the same texture/taste as real cheese.  Sourdough bread really good.  But a grilled cheese sandwich shouldnt take 2 hours to serve.\n\nEven my vegan friends in town know of this restaurant's reputation and said they could have told me not to bother with Pura Vida.

Vegan or not, these are some of the yummiest I've had. I like very light and fluffy cakes and not enough places serve good syrup that compliments and not overpower into a saccharine coma. I always share sweet breakfast foods since it often is too much sweet, but I can see myself actually ordering this and being able to eat it with maybe a side of sausage. \n\nMy Love Burritos were spicy, zesty, and flavor filled like I was hoping for. The two burritos were perfect for sharing and there was all kinds of spiraled veggies garnished but I ate those too....maybe that could be like a \"salad\" with some dressing on it? I like that the tortilla was grilled....I always get disappointed with sandwich wraps around town that just hand you a cold tortilla. This was filling indeed so it could be for a big man appetite to go at it alone. \n\nOf course, keep in mind this isn't fast food. Everything is fresh made and did take a while.It wasn't completely packed but there was a constant flow of people.. probably was 15 minutes for our pancakes then another 10 for our burritos to come. I thought that isn't unreasonable. The staff was nice and our server was friendly, attentive, service with a smile. \n\nThe reason why I haven't been, even when my BF and I were eating 100% plant based is the times. It really sucks being night people and these breakfast places are closed before we even wake on weekends. 2pm Saturdays seems too limited for a city like ours...and it's also closed Sundays.

The place was quite small as well, with six tables inside and two outside. However, it has a very welcoming feel and the waitress was extremely friendly.\n\nTheir menu selection wasn't that big, and price can be leaning towards expensive, however, considering they are a vegan place and lots of the ingredients are more expensive to start off with, I'd say it's reasonable and expected. Gluten free is available to order for some of the dishes, but it does require advance notice.\n\nOnce we were sat, the waitress informed us that the chef cooks by the order, which means long wait time, especially if you have a bigger crowd in front of you. While it can be inconvenient and different from the normal restaurant, I find this refreshing. Just be prepared  for the wait, and don't come with a hungry stomach.\n\nTried the Wow Pastry and the Chocolate pancake with boysenberry syrup.

A basic cup of black coffee is $4 which seems pretty high to me.

So awesome!!!\n- GMO free, organic, & fair trade whenever available \n\nI know you meat-lovers & non-vegans out there are thinking. How can this food be delicious? It is. Trust me. In my quest for better health & attempt to be vegan (ok, I'm probably vegan 95% of the time, I can't lay off dairy! Err!) I am saddened by the fact that Pura Vida is not in my neighborhood. Far from it, but I still attempt to come whenever I can.\n\nWhat's on their menu? Waffles, French toast, pancakes, scrambles. Their newest items this week: PB + Banana + Chocolate + Raspberry Mini Pancakes. Or Cinnamon Walnut French Toast. In the mood for lunch? You can have sandwiches, quesadillas, create-your-own wraps, chili, & empanadas. They make daily bakery items, chocolate cakes, muffins, etc. I tried their chili, empanadas, & one of their gluten-free Latin'tude (posted pics). Yum :)\n\nPros:\n\nService - incredible. Their servers are very knowledgeable about the menu & will try to accommodate any dietary requests or allergies. Very friendly & helpful.\n\nYumminess - I love the efforts they make to provide great tasting food, using organic whenever possible. They prove that you don't need to eat any animal products to have a fulfilling meal. \n\nPortions - huge! Took home leftovers every time!\n\nCons:\n\nLocation - not the most convenient wholesome neighborhood. I think Cheetah's is right down the street. I'm glad I'm here during daylight hours.\n\nTimeliness - this isn't fast food. It's good wholesome food made to order. They ask customers to give them 40 minutes for take-out orders, and it seems to be the same when you eat there. That's why they urge you to call in ahead of time. You could even call a day before (I can imagine most people can't plan that well like me, but I love that they offer the option) They will reserve a seat for you if you give them notice. They did for me, table for one.\n\nPrice - good ingredients comes at a cost. Most complete meals are $11-18. I'm more than happy to pay for quality, but I understand some people want to spend less on breakfast or lunch. The portions are well worth your money, in my opinion. One dish has always lasted me for two sittings or more. And I don't know about you, but knowing you're eating a great healthy meal, feeling good about what you ate is worth the extra dollars. \n\nConsistency - availability changes daily. So do the specials. The gluten-free chocolate cake you got one day is not there the next time you visit. Bakery items sell out fast. They've informed me though that anything can be available if you call. You want vegan pumpkin pie? I called a couple days before Thanksgiving & they made it.

It also seems that Chef either cannot afford or does not allow anyone else to be doing cook/prep in the kitchen.  Meaning that even though the place is tiny, if it is full (which is likely at meal times) you could easily wait an hour+ for your food.  I have had smoothies and other drinks fail to be delivered because Chef was too busy.  If you can't trust anyone else on your staff to make a coffee drink then you either are way too controlling or you need a new staff.  ***Please watch a few episodes of Kitchen Nightmares and take the advise to heart!***\n\nThere is so much potential for greatness here.

We took a taxi from our hotel and arrived to the restaurant at 9:20 AM on Saturday. The restaurant looked closed. My boyfriend tried the door and it was locked. I decided to be resourceful and call the restaurant to see if they were open. (I wish I never made this call! We should've left and eaten elsewhere!) They answered and said they were open and had forgotten to unlock the doors.\n\nThe restaurant looked dirty (typical whole-in-the-wall type of place). We were seated and menus were distributed. When we rummaged through 3 different menus, we were horrified at how haphazardly the items were placed and completely confused on how to even order. To make matters worst, the server tried to explain the menu to us - even more OVERWHELMING and EXHAUSTING! Items that had fruits and avocados listed will now only come with bananas since avocados and other fruits were \"not in season\" for the restaurant. Some items would take over 45 minutes and other items you can't even order unless you made a reservation ahead of time.\n\nCrap, we're stuck here. The taxi driver already left. So we decided to order a WOW, french toast with a side of WOW, and Tha' Waffle. However, we asked for the WOW to be made without potatoes (my boyfriend's mom is severely allergic). The server was completely confused on how to place the order. Apparently, the cook can't make that dish without the potatoes. So she suggested to order the items that come on that plate as a la carte. Fine, we ordered as a la carte. We were tired of looking at that puzzling menu.\n\n15 minutes later the \"Chef\" decides to come talk to us about how the WOW plate would be prepared. (Wait, she didn't even start on the food yet?) She said she wouldn't be replacing the potatoes for something else since the potatoes are the bed of the plate and everything else goes on top, but rather she would be removing the potatoes and adding extra bit of this and that. So she was trying to UP-SELL us because my boyfriend's mom is allergic to potatoes? My boyfriend had to clarify to her that we are not going to pay extra. We don't care if she adds more of whatever she wants or doesn't add anything at all, just take out the potatoes! She continued talking and moving her hands and flailing her arms trying to describe us the plate. She kept emphasizing how she WOULD NOT REPLACE the potatoes but would be REMOVING them and adding other stuff. What in the world? Does this person know what the word \"replace\" means?\n\nWe say fine and she finally goes back to the kitchen. A table near us receives their food in a timely manner (15 minutes after ordering). We've been waiting 30 minutes now. The server says \"THEIR FOOD CAME OUT FIRST BECAUSE THEY ORDERED YESTERDAY.\" What in the world?!?? After 45 minutes of this grueling wait, my boyfriend's mom's food comes out. The chef comes out, too! (Not again, stay in the kitchen please!) My boyfriend's mom is displeased and when the chef asks how her dish is, she says \"So-so\" (my boyfriend's mom's English is very limited, I'm surprised she didn't spit out what was in her mouth back on to the plate). Then the chef says, \"All I want is a smile from her!\" The audacity of this lady!!\n\nThere was a yellow flower placed on top of her plate of food. She took the flower off the plate and placed it on the table. When my waffle came out a few minutes later, the chef came out again! Then she takes the flower off the table and places it on top of my waffle and says, \"You get a flower too!\" Is this place that cheap that they have to reuse garnishing?!??\n\nOverall, our experience was horrifying! I've never had vegan food before and if this is the best that a vegan restaurant can offer, then I can never be a vegan.\n\nIf you still want to dine there, here are some tips:\n\n1. Order your food the day before you plan on actually eating it\n2. Be ready to wait for at least 45 minutes for your food if you didn't order yesterday\n3. Don't get an explanation of the menu\n4. Stay away from talking to the chef\n\nThe bill was $49 before tip - we ordered only three plates and no drinks.

This was my letter to Chef Mayra after the Titanic x Hindenburg disaster that was their Valentine's Day dinner. \n\n\"I hate to say it but I am livid and a bit appalled after tonight's Valentine's dinner. We paid $75 for 15 courses; you gave up after 12, and a couple of the courses were thrown & plated together last minute instead of being the separate courses they were advertised as. When you pay for something, you should receive it. Not only were we denied the extra courses, but it took forever to get them - you asked us to come early and that dinner would be served 6-9 PM; the first course wasn't even served until 6:40 PM. We left at 10 PM (we had plans at 9:30 - oh well!) confused as to where the rest of the courses were. There was very little explanation or communication and definitely poor planning. As a vegan I was excited for this opportunity and have eaten at your establishment many times, as well as referred you to others, but this will most likely be my last time. My husband really wanted this year to be special, but it was a huge headache. If you do this next year I hope you severely edit the menu and the prices so everyone leaves satisfied and at the designated time. You knew how many people were coming well in advance and should have had a test run of some sort. The only semblance of apology came from your servers when the food was not being served in the beginning. My husband is now even complaining he's still hungry as we didn't eat earlier in the day to fit this event in! This is one of the worst of not the absolute worst restaurant experiences I have ever been privy to and I hope to never repeat this episode of Vegan Survivor ever again.\"\n\nI appreciate that everything is made ready-to-order, but when you're serving FIFTEEN courses to 40 guests who you asked to arrive early and did actually have a definitive ending time of 9 PM, you have to make sure it goes smoothly which it did not. My husband and I were starved for over an hour before the food started coming. We estimated our time of exit by how \"quickly\" the food was coming out and it should have ended past midnight! Completely awful. A bunch of people left (and I wish I were one of them), and I'm pretty sure every single person left unsatisfied. \n\nThis establishment has absolutely 0 business acumen and it is going to hurt them. You don't even have to watch a couple episodes of Kitchen Nightmares to realize Pura Vida is doing it wrong. If you have to come out and explain every menu item as well as feel the need to put pictures of the food in the convoluted menu, as a diner you should run immediately. \n\nNow I was going to give Pura Vida the benefit of the doubt since they did email the patrons and offered the rest of the courses, we just had to email & give the time we're coming in. Which my husband did. And apparently he had to confirm back which was not explained whatsoever. So he is currently at Pura Vida waiting for them to make the final meal we will enjoy from there. \n\nI sincerely wish Chef Mayra luck (she's going to need it!) but I will not be back. \n\nP.S.

The food was outstanding! We were served fresh, original culinary delights that were, not only vibrant and delectable, but had a beautiful visual presentation. A vegan and vegetarian dream!

Not only did we have a very difficult time selecting from the vast menu, we had a tremendous \"doggy bag\" to take with us on the road. \n\nThe staff were simply incredible. Our server was gregarious and friendly. It was as though she invited us \"out-of-towners\" into her home. She had many suggestions, although, admitted that it was hard for her to select one given her enjoyment of so many--which was understandable from my perspective. Many of the food choices simply depend on your own personal desire and pull to eat certain types of foods at certain times.\n\nThe owner/culinary creator made an intentional effort to meet us as well. She came to our table not only for feedback but also just as a warm, kind gesture. She asserts that her food is created with love and positive energy. We talked about generally shared interested such as endorsing local farms (for freshness & quality but also to cut back on emissions associate with food delivery as well as to support small, local businesses). \n\nThese folks are community, wellness, and spiritually conscientious individuals. It was a pleasure to be in their company. \n\nPersonally, I loved my food and would order it multiple times over. My partner liked but wasn't crazy about the tuna fish salad sandwich he ordered. To me, this is understandable. One's enjoyment of any dish is likely to be based on his/her overall taste preferences and mood to eat certain flavors in the moment. [For instance, I am not a fan of dill or curry.] He was never one to like fish, so to select a vegan, fish alternative, was a surprise to me; it was a bold move. He wanted to try something very new to him. Unfortunately, it may not have been his style. This simply is occasionally the case sometimes when one selects new entrees (or rather what perhaps you may experience when trying a new ethnic type of cuisine that you are not familiar with). Somethings are not for everyone. He love the chili and salad, however, as well as my sandwich. :) \n\nI, unfortunately, was unable to try any desserts .I will simply too full. If I visit Las Vegas again, the bistro will certainly be one of my stops. As others have said, it is hard to find establishments such as this.

Let's break it down: \n\nPro's: \nThe food is really great. \nThe Chef is passionate about food \nThere is a lot to choose from. \n\nCon's \nThe wait - it can take 1+ hours to get a simple dish. I've been on a few occasions and the host has told me that if I called a day or 2 ahead of time I would have got the food faster. \n\nThe price - for two of us at lunch we paid 56 dollars. That is more than what you'll pay at Wynn. We got 2 lunch specials and an appetizer, no drinks. At Wynn we got 2 appetizers drinks and entrees and paid 60 dollars. Even with the Groupon it was just too expensive for what it is. \n\nThe service. The staff is very kind, when they come around. It can take a long time to even get a menu. \n\nThe menu - what would work great here is a fixed menu. Just 2-3 things that the Chef decides on every day. They bring you 3-5 menu's and then have all of these add ons, restrictions and things to let you know. Like \"This dish is great, but avocado is not in season so we use something else, and you can't get berries in this dish anymore, but you can get bananas, and you can't get this dish anymore, but the chef made something else up, but we don't remember what it is\". I think the Chef is brilliant - so let her be brilliant and offer 2-3 things a day that she loves. Rather than a huge confusing menu that takes hours to get through. \n\nThe atmosphere. They could easily get away with the eccentricity, weird menu and long waits if the place was really nice inside. It  is definitely a hole in the wall kind of place, plastic thick table cloths and all, which works if it's an inexpensive and fast diner. \n\nLike I said - I really want this place to work, and I think it could, but there definitely needs to be some improvements and some price adjusting, I'm still shocked how much we paid for a meal.

The company's website encourages ordering ahead, and other reviewers warned of half hour wait times. Still, nothing could have prepared me to showing up for brunch, being handed 1 menu for our party of 2, and being told it would be at least 15 minutes before we could even have our order TAKEN. After finally ordering, we waited an additional HOUR AND 15 MINUTES for our food to arrive. Meanwhile, other tables who had only been there 30-40 minutes started to receive their orders. Luckily, our poor, over-worked server could not have been more of a saint, and she visibly looked pained every time she'd have to tell us that we'd have to wait \"just a bit longer.\" Eventually, the Chef had to come out and apologize. Apparently she had re-arranged the tickets, and ours kept getting pushed back in the mix. She wound up comping our bill, which left me feeling less cranky about the horrendous wait time.\n\nBut, enough about that--- here's what I love: the food. Dear lord, it was amazing. Here's a list of a few things we ordered, and my thoughts on them:\n-The Chili: Amazing! It had this lovely balance of sweetness (thanks to succulent chucks of yam) and spice (peppers, I presume). Easily, it was the best chili I've ever had in my life.\n-The Side Salad: Huge. Easily a side salad for 2. Loved the surprising, fresh ingredients, like sliced oranges. We had the creamy garlic dressing, and it was quite tasty without being over-powering.\n-The Latintude Burrito: Massive. Soyrizo is my favorite, and this one had just the right amount. The Vegan cheese was super convincing, and my taste buds couldn't tell the difference. I loved that the burrito was nicely grilled, making the tortilla crispy and delicious! Despite being packed to the brim, I think this is the 1st burrito I've ever had that didn't fall apart/turn to mush.\n-The Empanadas: Crust was flaky and golden. The contents were a little too creamy for my liking. With everything mixed/blended together, I had a hard time making out individual ingredients. I can't even tell you what was in it. The boyfriend loved it though. \n\nSo, there were things I loved and things I hated about this place. Would I ever dine there again? Never.

This is pretty much addressing the complaint most people had - the prolonged period of time to get food or service. It's somewhat true, but we actually got our food in reasonable time.

Both were presented artfully, and both were very delicious. Very high quality food is served here. I can't imagine any way that anyone, vegan or not, would think otherwise. Flavorful and delicious. I will say the French toast was extremely sweet, though. This isn't uncommon.\n\nInitially I thought, \"wow, this place is ridiculously expensive,\" but after eating I think it was almost worth it.

I ordered the chocolate pancakes, my husband got the PB and banana stuffed pancakes, my friend got some other type of pancake, and my other friend got the french toast. The servings were HUGE, as in, I could have easily shared with someone and we would have both been full. I ate less than half of my meal, as it came with 4 or 5 very large pancakes. If you are going to have pancakes or french toast and don't tend to have a monstrous appetite, I would recommend ordering with the syrup on the side so that you can take a to-go box. Ours were pre-syruped, so they would have gotten soggy if we would have tried to take our leftovers. If I was rating this restaurant just on my food that I ordered, it would be 5 stars. Delicious.\n\nThe bad:\n1) Menu selection: This is one of those vegan restaurants that is able to be vegan because they use lots of fake meats, fake cheese,  and soy. If you are soy sensitive or trying to avoid soy (or just don't like the fake meats and fake cheeses), you may have a hard time finding something to eat unless you are there for breakfast. \n\n2) The wait: HOLY COW. Unreasonable doesn't even begin to cover it. I called about an hour ahead and we were seated immediately when we got there (there were about 3 or 4 empty tables left, which is a lot given how small this place it), but waited literally an hour and 20 minutes for our food. They told us it would be 45 minutes and asked if we wanted a snack while we waited. My friend ordered a fruit plate, and that took 35 minutes to come out (yes, we were timing it). It was obvious that the fruit was pre-cut (the apples had that browning around the edges from sitting after being cut), so why on earth it took 35 minutes to throw some fruit onto a bowl is beyond me.  Also, 3 of our meals were done about 15-20 minutes ahead of the 4th, so we were almost done eating by the time the last person at our table got his food. \n\n3) The coffee: This is a little thing, but the coffee was WAY too strong (or had been sitting for SEVERAL hours, which I don't think is even possible given that we were there at 11:30 am). My friend ordered the coffee and used 3 servings of creamer, and it was still too strong to drink. We all tried it and agreed on this. \n\n4) Don't judge this place by its location or its exterior.

The place is very small and almost looks like it's from a movie taking place in old Mexico, from the outside, but that's beside the point.  We entered with open minds.  Upon seeing the inside of the restaurant we noticed the entire place had about 10 tables, most of which were 2-tops, and I wondered why a reservation was required.  A woman at the register seated us with no mention of  a reservation, so I didn't worry about it.\nWhile we were looking over the menu, this very tall, overbearing Latin woman in chef-type attire came to the table next to us with a man dressed also as a chef.  It took a minute for me to realize that she was the owner/head chef reprimanding the other chef for his portion size using the 2 customers as living examples, IN FRONT OF the customers, WHILE they were eating the food!!! Very strange and uncomfortable for the customers, and unprofessional in general.\nI ordered a wrap that said it should come with either chili or a side salad or soup but was told there is no soup so I was instead offered a fruit salad.  This came first and although the variety of fruits on top and the portion size looked very good, I soon realized that all the apple slices at the bottom were bitter from aging.  So I left the whole bottom of the fruit plate untouched.\nAfter about 40 min. from ordering, and watching the head chef woman walk around all over the place but not in the kitchen, we asked the server if the food was almost ready.  She THEN explained that due to \"macro cooking\" processes, they cook at a super low heat and it takes longer than a regular restaurant.  Would have appreciated knowing that BEFORE we ordered.  Maybe we would have gotten a quick  appetizer or something.  Anyway, a few minutes later our entrees finally came out.  My wrap ended up looking different than I expected, with the \"tomato slices\" being 2 tiny pcs of tomato as a garnish, rather than inside my wrap as the description made it sound.  But it tasted good and I was hungry so that was fine.\nMy friend had ordered basically a veggie sandwich with garlic and peppers.  What she got was a glorified grilled cheese sandwich.  We brought it up to the server who seemed confused and went to the kitchen to verify what she had told them.  Then she went to the chef to ask.  (Why didn't one of the only 2 servers in the place know what the menu item was supposed to consist of?)  Then the chef comes over and proceeds to give a laundry list of excuses as to why the food was WAAAAAY different than described in the menu.  She says there's a disclaimer at the bottom that we missed stating something about chef changing menu items as she sees fit, that she hadn't been happy with the integrity of the sandwich as it was or something, that she had a new baker whose bread was now 2x the size so we got a great value, that the sandwich actually does have tomatoes as promised (though they were just 2 little slices on the side), that my friend was confused and should've ordered a different item if that's what she wanted.  Then, after forcing excuses on us in her overbearing way, for like 5 minutes, she asks \"but is everything good?  Does it all taste ok?\".  It was so awkward.  So my friend and I both said everything was fine to get this very tall, overpowering woman away from us.  \nBoth of us agreed the food tasted just fine, but was misrepresented.  I think if nothing else had been different, at least the simple paper menus in plastic sleeves could've been retyped to reflect that certain menu items were COMPLETELY different than described.  The customer service by chef/owner woman was terrible, and by the servers was just ok.  I feel that the people here put out the minimum amt of effort possible until you ask questions (that you dont' know you should have to ask) and then when an issue comes up, it's like it's the customer's fault.  No apology or discount was offered to rectify my friend's meal.  So we will probably never go back and spread this info to everyone we know who may be interested in Vegan food.

I ordered the eggless salad sandwich and that also did not disappoint. It was loaded with veggies and stacked really high and came with an amazing fruit salad and drink.

Suzy H. is a fan, so I know it's got to be good. For my first visit, I was wowed by the vegan marble waffle, which was covered with strawberries, bananas, chocolate chips, and chocolate sauce--this is vegan?  Sign me up!  The dish came with a side of tofu scramble, but just too much food for me to eat alone.  I ate half the waffle and two bites of the scramble.   Along with breakfast burritos made with veggies, vegan cheese, tofu, etc., the menu for breakfast is also loaded with a lot of sweet stuff, which was surprising to me.  Among other things, there is French Toast, short stacks of pancakes, waffles,  and dark choco waffles, many of the dishes served with fresh fruit.  This is a tiny place and it feels like being in Chef Mayra's kitchen, really.  She's the half Lebanese/half Cuban/ vegan cheerleader/owner/chef and this is her little kingdom.

Chef Mayra is a warm, friendly soul who greeted us and also served us our meals and chatted for a bit.  \nMy second visit, I went with the Sexy Short Stack, pancakes made with organic flour, cinnamon, vanilla and banana with vegan maple syrup to drizzle over it.

As a matter of fact, I have been a customer of Chef Mayra's since BEFORE this restaurant opened-- my father hired her to bake me a vegan cake for my 21st birthday.\n\nIn terms of Pura Vida, the food at this establishment has been consistently good. Yes, the wait is long; yes, the menus are all over the place; yes, the place is run in a discombobulated fashion; yes, sometimes the staff is short with customers. But the food has always been tasty. \n\nMy visit earlier today, though, will mark the last time that I patronize them. Ever. Please read of my experience below:\n\nMy friend and I walked in around 11AM and were briskly told to \"read the sign!\" Looking around, we were unsure of what sign to read. When it was pointed out to us, it stated plainly that no Groupons would be accepted this weekend following the 4th of July, and that if we have a Groupon we can come back tomorrow. [This immediately gave me a flashback to Father's Day weekend '13 when I came in with a different friend and, upon attempting to redeem her Groupon, were told that they would not accept it due to the holiday weekend. Even though it expired that weekend, and no where on the Groupon did it say that it was void on holiday weekends]. \n\nContinuing on... Not having a Groupon on this visit, my friend and I didn't worry about the sign. We were then asked, rather shortly, \"So do you still want to eat here?!\" I could barely get the 'yes' out of my mouth before we were then asked, \"Well, do you have a reservation?!\" Having not EVER made a reservation, save for Mother's Day '13, I said 'no'. We were then met, pretty much, with a, \"Let me see if we have room for you\". Thankfully, after a brief time, we were seated. \n\nUpon choosing our meals, our orders were taken. I decided on 'Tha Frenchie', which is a french toast dish with syrup, bananas, fresh berries [when they are in season], and \"A DRIZZLING\" of chocolate syrup. Having ordered this dish on Mother's Day and not able to eat more than two bites because it was absolutely DRENCHED in chocolate syrup [and had no berries, since they were not in season], I politely asked three questions this time: 1) Are berries in season? (yes) 2) So there will be berries on my french toast? (yes) 3) Can I please order the dish with no chocolate syrup? (yes)\n\nAfter some great conversation with my friend, our meals arrived. My french toast had no chocolate syrup on it, but neither did it have any berries. Before the waitress walked away I said, \"Oh! It looks like the berries are missing. May I please have my berries?\" to which she replied, \"Let me check\".\n\nPuzzled by this response, my friend and I exchanged looks.\n\nChef Mayra, the owner, then walked abrasively up to our table and lectured me on how my choosing to get no chocolate syrup messed up the flavor profile and, essentially, how dare I think that I could further ruin the flavor profile by enjoying berries on the dish with no chocolate syrup (?). It really made no sense at all, so I then said, \"Well, the menu says that the dish comes with fresh berries...I just didn't want the chocolate...\" Chef Mayra then continued and stated that I am \"lucky\" that she is here today, else her chefs would not have even altered her \"Signature Dish\" to the extent of not putting chocolate syrup on it because they are trained to not alter the Signature Dishes. \n\nOh, but this is a special day--- so she then handed me one large strawberry, sliced up on a plate. \"Here is your berry this time. But we won't be able to do this next time\".\n\nWow. \n\nI felt like that was a huge slap in the face. And the whole deal still doesn't make much sense to me. Why was she in such a bad mood? Why was she so offended that I didn't want chocolate syrup? To be sure, I didn't mention the thirteen wasted dollars on Mother's Day due to the french toast being ruined by a gallon of chocolatey goodness. Maybe I should have? \n\nIn any case, I felt like a very undervalued customer today. In the time since Pura Vida opened its doors, I have brought A LOT of varied business to them-- business that would have, initially, never even considered this restaurant less I suggested  it.\n\nIt really is too bad to see such a good restaurant idea not live up to its potential because of bad customer service.

The efficiency and timing of the kitchen is horrible and be prepared to wait 30 minutes to an hour for entrees. I see this a lot in mom and pop local restaurants, great food, but they have no idea how to be efficient and create a dining experience that is as good as the food. I really hope that the owner pays attention to these reviews be because there is so much potential here. Let me give a specific example of the lack of efficiency with this place. They were on a wait because they were holding 4 tables for reservations. I'm fine with a little wait, but there was no reason for a wait. I watched 3 tables stay dirty for over 10 minutes while 3 parties waited to be seated. In the mean time, nobody was showing up for the reservations, so now there were 7 tables (almost half the restaurant) not being sat because 1)tables were not being bussed because if the lack of staff and 2) they were holding tables for people that were not there yet. What should have happened was the tables that were ready should have been sat right away with walk-ins and the 3 dirty tables should have been bussed i a reasonable about of time to accommodate the reservations. When you have reservations, you have to be able to use tables like puzzle pieces and not hold specific tables for specific parties (unless its a large party and only certain tables can accommodate them). It's as if the people running this restaurant have no experience running a busy restaurant. They need help with organization and help with the basic day to day functions of running an establishment that wants to grow and thrive in a competitive market. Also, I've eaten here probably 5 times and I've always felt the wait for food is wayyyy too long. They need some help in the food prep organization to execute food in a timely manor.

The reason I feel unable to  give them more stars are a couple of minor things.  First the menu's were very confusing.  They handed us three menus and it was overwhelming to read through them and figure out what to order.  The kitchen was out of at least 25% of the menu which was confusing when we were sat down.  My other beef is that they charge for literally everything.  They have their dishes as is on the menu, and then they push to upsale you on extra's such as onions, salsas, sauces.  The chef even came out and stated how a sandwich would be amazing with certain added ingredients.  The prices were already a bit steep and then with any with additions, you can very easily take a $12 sandwich and pay close to $18 for a sandwich!  The way I feel is for the price, make the sandwich with all of those ingredients and allow the customer to omit, versus add and pay the cost for it.  The staff continued to suggest trying sauces and salsas with our food and my husband unknowingly agreed until I warned him that they were all $2 each time.  We had $10 of extras to our bill :( Otherwise, fun and interesting vegan food.  Worth the drive off the strip to find it.

My mistake - I thought they were open until 2:00pm as per the Yelp app, but the Chef vigorously and almost frantically informaed us that they closed at 1:45pm, therefore they only had 5 items available. We mentioned that that was fine since we only had an hour anyway since we were headed to the airport.  This invoked another frantic explanation about how she needed TIME to prepare the food and couldn't be RUSHED.  This whole encounter was stressing me out...\n\nI asked if we could get anything to go and she pointed out some vegan cupcakes then mentioned she could get us some chili! Awesome!!  Chili it is!!  We ordered two servings of chili to go.\n\nWe sat down at an empty table to wait for our chili.  There was only one other couple in the restaurant and they appeared to be done with their meal - i.e. no plates or silverware, enjoying coffee.  We continued to wait.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes I stood up to clarify our order with the guy behind the register.  We ordered chili to-go, right?  The guy called out to inquire about the status of the chili and the Chef burst out of the kitchen saying, yes, you ordered it to go, right? Right? I'm preparing it to go.  Right? That's what I understood. To go!!\n\nThe whole experience was just kind of bizarre. And dramatic. And borderline rude.\n\nNot to mention that while we we waiting a group of four came in.  They got the same frantic explanation about the limited menu. They chose to sit down.  They made the mistake of bringing in outside drinks (iced coffees).  Now, while I was waiting I spied the signs about outside drinks not being allowed.  I then watched the chef approach the table and just take the drinks from the customers and put them in the garbage. No verbal explanation. No, \"Hey, would you like to finish that? We don't allow outside drinks.\" She just took them from the customers and threw them away. REALLY?? The customers were kind of playing along with the drama, but you could tell that that action was a direct hit.\n\nFinally the two 16 oz containers of chili come out.  Yay! Then he rings me up. $10 per serving??  I'm sorry, that seems high to me. $21.62 for two medium sized containers to go??  Whatever, just give me my food.\n\nAnd now onto the food!  The one thing I ordered.  It was a pumpkin, squash, black bean chili.  It was excellent! The mixture was seasoned really well, the flavors and textures were well combined... it was some of the best vegan chili I've ever had!\n\nI really wanted to have a great experience.  The cool, divey exterior, the photos of adopted turkeys on the walls, the fact it was a fully-vegan shop... but I didn't. And honestly, I don't think I would go back.\n\nFootnote: as we  were leaving and getting ready to pull out of the parking lot, the group of four has decided to leave as well.

Additionally, lunch for me has to be hearty meal, which sandwiches are usually not. But nonetheless, a friend a I decided to check it out for lunch one day we weren't too famished. The Center is very nice, with ample parking and big, big windows. I think they could use a bit more vegetation outside, what with the white walls, white stones, white fences, etc. But it gives the place a nice, light, airy feeling. \n\nThe Caf\u00e9 is right at the entrance, and they have a couple of tables to enjoy your lunch at. We placed out order (LGBTQ for me) and since no tables were available, we took a seat at the lounge chairs in the back by the library. I can understand how they are trying to offer a community space to hang out at, what with the free Wi-Fi and comfy chairs, but really the tables should be for eating. People were taking their dear time, and although the chairs we sat at were comfy and there was a little table to place our food on, it would've been better to sit at a table. Just saying.\n\nOn to the food! The sandwich was THE BOMB! It was incredible! Best BLT I've ever had in my life. Period. Also, it looks like a small portion but I ended up very satisfied at the end. My only complaint would be that the tomatoes could've been a bit more ripe but other than that is was delicious and I will definitely be coming back, and often!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 5, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "First you walk in thinking its an office building....

Luckily I came across some great reviews of the Bronze Caf\u00e9 on yelp & I'm glad I can add this spot onto my new list of lunch spots.\n\nThe first time I came to this Caf\u00e9 I got lost trying to find it.  I was expecting a stand alone caf\u00e9 but it's actually inside a community center.  When you get inside, it somewhat resembles a student services center or library.\n\nNow on to the menu, there were a ton of things I saw on the menu that I wanted to try but I went with the more popular items that were reviewed.\n\nFOOD:\n\nLGBTQ- A twisted version of the class BLT that we're all used to.  This one definitely takes the cake!  I love anything with bacon & this sandwich not only has strips of maple bacon, but also bacon jam spread onto their ciabatta bread.  I was a little hesitant about the cucumber but it actually compliments that sandwich and gives it that fresh little crunch when you eat it. I crave this sandwich often! (my favorite)\n\nGreen Goddess Chicken Salad Sandwich-  This sandwich was really delicious and although its chicken salad you don't feel the heaviness of a typical chicken salad in your stomach.\n\nHummus- Their hummus is really tasty & they serve it with warm pita bread.  It's a great side dish that only costs an additional $2.25 if you get a sandwich.  Sometimes I'll just get the hummus by itself and eat that for a light lunch.\n\nVegan Banana Boy Bait-  I'm not a fan of bananas or banana flavored items, but the Banana Boy Bait is an exception!  I sometimes just crave this and this alone, it could be a good snack or even a dessert.  It's not too sweet and the banana flavor isn't too overpowering.\n\n\n\n\nDRINKS:\n\nVegan coconut almond blend-  This was the first drink I purchased here and I really liked the concept.  It's blended with coconut water and they added almond butter for texture.\n\nBut my all time favorite drink from the Bronze Cafe is the Matcha Green Tea Blended.

We came in just planning to get a few juices and smoothies, but left trying quite a few items on the menu. After ordering Raw Vegan Superfood smoothie (which is so tasty and creamy), we ended up staying for a lot longer.\n\nFirst of all, the LGBTQ Sandwich - OK, I've had BLTs and I've had Bacon Jam. The housemade bacon jam is a godsend. There is nothing I've had like it, it's meaty, savory, smokey, and sweet. Get this sandwich!\n\nDavid also made an off menu sandwich for us called \"The Complicated Order\", it's a GLBTQ crossed with \"The What What\" (which is a fantastic sandwich in itself). AWESOME, even better than the LGBTQ.\n\nThe scones we tried (Bacon Jam and Poblano Cheddar) as well as the Cinnamon Toast Crunch cookie and the Loving vs. Virginia (a brownie baked with a chocolate chip cookie on top) were all unique, but most importantly, incredibly tasty. \n\nWe also sampled the Swedish Oatmeal, which was yummy along with being satisfyingly creamy and hearty.\n\nWe also had a chance to meet Paul, the chef and I made it a point to tell him how awesome everything is.

I'll just run down the list.\n\nThe good earth pita. This thing was a fantastically delicious mash of vegetables in a fresh pita. I had a certain expectation of the amount of flavor that should have been in this and it was dramatically exceeded. This is how you make veggie-style wraps. It could convert anyone into believing meat-free is the way to be.\n\nThe California turkey is nothing revolutionary in terms of what's in it. What do you think is in here? Turkey and avocado, right? You win! But I will say, delicious again. The bread was toasted to be crispy top and bottom, while still being cottony soft inside. The avocado and turkey were plentiful and fresh. There was a mix of mayo and other little veggie bits all over. Each bite was familiar, but just a little more delightful than I expected. Great textures and flavors.\n\nFor desserts, the blueberry and banana boy baits were consumed, and a strawberry cheesecake. All of these were vegan, and that's pretty spectacular considering they were so damn good. I make vegan desserts and they make mine wilt a little inside. The blueberry boy bait was somewhere between a crumble and coffee cake. The banana boy bait was a very dense banana bread. Extremely rich. The cheesecake has the consistency of a whipped sort of topping made of pistachio (?) and coconut oil. Oh, and strawberry of course.\n\nFor drinks, I was surprised to see options like cantaloupe-turmeric and honeydew cucumber. Both refreshing. Oh, and the turmeric is not as strong as you'd expect so don't be turned off from it!\n\nGo here. Immediately. It's expensive considering basically each sandwich is $9-10, but a couple extra bucks for the organic factor as well as the overall quality, flavor, and flexibility is worth it.

I'm not really a vegetable eater but we gave it a shot because it's their most popular one.  I loved all the flavors and I totally forgot that everything I was eating was healthy and vegetable-y!  \n\nI cannot wait until they have their own place, because right now, they are currently set up inside the LGBTQ center in downtown Las Vegas, and most importantly, I can't wait until they make their way to California!", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 2, "cool": 4}}, {"text": "The staff is very friendly and I've only had the Bizness salad which I give it a A+ yumm..

Best spur-of-the-moment find ever! They offer scones, cheesecake, cookies, healthy bars, sandwiches, salads, smoothies, lattes, coffees, and quinoa sides. They have flavored agave packs here! Skinny tubes of it for less than $1. Very cool. Offers vegan, vegetarian, and meaty options. Now that's what I call: choices! \n\nNOTE: They do delivery here! $3 charge for orders less than $30. Free for over that price. Great idea for DTLV residents or for company lunches.\n\nGoodwich was closed by 3pm on sundays. Thought we could make it, but we were an hour late! Curse you daylight savings! But really, if we didn't forget, we would have not found this place sooner.\n\nI pulled up the yelp app looking for nearby eats and they directed me to the Bronze Caf\u00e9 located in the Center. I did not expect this place to be so good! The guys working here were AWESOME. Love them. They made excellent recommendations. \n\nWhile we were waiting for our food, he gave us spoon samples of their chocolate cheesecake, strawberry, and pecan. Amazingly high-quality. Fresh. Housemade and NOT bought from a distributor. Bronze Caf\u00e9, for sure, is the real deal.\n\nWe ordered the kale, banana, apple vegan smoothie. Yummy. Not bitter and the perfect amount of sweet! Refreshing for a perfect spring/summer day. Comes in two sizes. 14 oz. ($4-5ish) and 24 oz. ($5.75). Get the bigger size. So worth the health.\n\nThere was extra smoothie in the blender so our server gave us the rest in another cup (See pic). Now that was really, really thoughtful. Seriously. It was a lot of juice! More than what I can say about Jamba Juice (you just know those jamba jerks have extra but won't give it to you!) \n\nTo start we had the HUMMUS: chickpeas, tahini, olive oil, cumin, paprika, lemon juice. I could have sworn it had roasted red pepper too... Comes with warm pita. ($3.95) kinda small for the price but it's only $2.25 if you ordered a sandwich/salad. Great for a small lunch/snack size. Creamy, smooth, fresh. Ridiculously tastes like tacos to me. The spices they used and the freshness just got to me. I wish I bought a tub to take home. Waaayyy better than store-bought hummus. Must-try!\n\nMy friend and I also ordered the Tree of Life (vegan) and I ordered the LGBTQ sandwich. \n\nTree of Life sandwich ($9.95): roasted red peppers, avocado, mixed greens, tomato, housemade pickled onions, housemade vegan cashew creama, brazil nut crumbles, mango cilantro vinaigrette on a pita flatbread. Comes with a small side salad of mixed greens in the vinaigrette. \nLOVED this. The crunch of the nut went surprisingly well with the avocado and the veggies. What the heck. These guys know how pair flavors! Who knew vegan could taste so good. (They make sure to note that pita bread isn't vegan, but this was so good).\n\nLGBTQ sandwich ($9.95): housemade bacon jam, maple-glazed bacon, mixed greens, tomato, cucumber, basil aioli, lemon vinaigrette on ciabatta bread.\nObviously not vegetarian. Comes with a small mixed green salad with vinaigrette as well. So freakin' bomb. The right amount of salty from the bacon without being overwhelming. Balanced out perfectly by the cucumber and tomato. Bacon was NOT greasy and complemented the veggies amazingly. And for Jesus's Chrysler sake, this has bacon jam in it. Bacon jam. I wanted to cry, confess, and break down in food-heaven convulsions right then and there. \n\nGoing to try their scones next time. Reasonably priced and way better-looking than starbucks' overpriced frozen sweets. Ranges from $1.75-$4ish. Big portions for pastries/scones/bars.\n\nI think I found my new lunch spot. It's also a chill place to kick back and read a book or bring your laptop. I believe there is free wi-fi and a few outlets. There's a reason why this place has 5 stars and I can definitely see why. \n\nChecking out The Center was on my to-do list forever, and it's an absolute gem to find this awesome caf\u00e9 here. Character, culture, and no gimmicks. The service, well-thought out fresh menu, and the options are fantastic. My favorite surprised find by far!!

I told him its my first time but I had my heart set on the Bizness. I like to see how different restaurants prepare kale salads. I love kale but haven't mastered how to make it tasty at home. I asked him for suggestions for sides. He said the broccoli with hemp hearts (great choice!), the curried quinoa (loved it!) and the last was eggplant dip which came with pita bread. The dip was served separately and not on the salad.\n\nI really went all out and also ordered a cheddar jalape\u00f1o scone per the employee's suggestion and Oh My Yumminess this was perfection! The green tea matcha smoothie with almond milk has a nice amount of sweetness (not too much). \n\nI did get a ginger cookie for later and it was small which wouldn't matter if it was good but for me it didn't have a strong enough ginger taste. It wasn't the taste you expect when wanting a ginger cookie. I'm also not a fan of crunchy cookies but I get that it was supposed to be like a ginger snap. I just prefer soft chewy cookies. \n\nOn my second visit I got the Bizness with broccoli again (yum), beet quinoa (yum) and lentil salad. This lentil salad was very thick and hearty and took over the kale and every other flavor in the salad. I could not mix it because all I would taste is the lentil salad so instead I ate it all first to get it off of my salad. I think its better off on the side but not mixed in with a light salad.\n\nI also got a Vegan banana bread square and although it was fairly moist the flavor was lacking for me. I make my own Vegan desserts at home and this banana bread just didn't hit the spot. I decided I don't think I will be ordering Vegan desserts here anymore. I might try the cheesecake since it's not a baked item.\nI am excited to go back but I need to rip myself away from the Bizness and try a sandwich. \n\nI think it's a great idea to serve the salad in a to go box so you won't need to ask for a to go box if you want one, but I've been eating there and it is a bit difficult eating out of that box. The side flaps stand straight up and won't bend down so each time I dip my fork in I hit the side of the box and I'm not sure if it's the box or the table but something is slippery and the box slides around the table. It would be nice to be served on a plate if you are eating there. \n\nThe workers here are all happy and in a good mood and that makes me happy coming here. They also seem to love the food and be really excited about telling me suggestions. I appreciate that too!

I really liked the atmosphere, it made me feel like I was a little bit more cool just for having been there.\n\nThe counter guy was super friendly, and offered us a sample of their lentil soup with veggies. It was very flavorful, and actually light & refreshing, which is quite an accomplishment for a bean soup.\n\nI really like roasted veggies, so I ordered The Good Earth, and I also got an ice-brewed coffee. The sandwich had lettuce, tomato, roasted? mushrooms, roasted eggplant, alfalfa sprouts, an orange dressing of some kind, sunflower seeds, and what tasted like candied walnuts. I love eggplant, but it really wan't cooked well enough. Cooked eggplant is kind of mushy (and delicious!), but this was still pretty firm & spongy, like it was pretty raw. All the other ingredients were fantastic, and even the candied walnuts went surprisingly well with the other ingredients. But for a roasted veggie sandwich, I also would have liked to see something other than just the eggplant & possibly mushrooms. (I am not sure if the mushrooms were actually roasted. I have not heard of such a thing, but otherwise the eggplant would have been the only roasted veggie.) The pita bread was delicious.\n\nMy friend had the Tree of Life, and she thought it was awesome.\n\nI can't really judge the ice-brewed coffee, as I have never had it before. I had heard it was much less bitter than heat-brewed coffee and so I really wanted to try it. But it pretty much just tasted like iced coffee but not as watered down. It could be the most phenomenal ice-brewed coffee ever, but it was my first taste so I can't compare it. Personally, I will stick with regular coffee in the future.\n\nWeird, right?

The people that work here are SO friendly and fantastic. I ordered hummus with a side of pita, the soup of the day (vegetable), and the tree of life. The gentleman who I paid with gave me a 5% student discount on top of my Yelp check-in. Lunch here was very fairly priced and with exceptional service. \n\nThey have 2 tables seated outside if you want to dine al-fresco, which we opted for, and an employee helped me carry my food out because my life is always a handful. The hummus was so fresh and tasty! You can tell it wasn't packaged and sitting there for days. The pita was very soft, and my daughter was so happy because hummus is one of her favorite foods. She also enjoyed the soup which had a plethora of various veggies (zucchini, yellow squash, tomatoes, carrots, hominy) and a very light broth that tasted like a bunch of boiled down veggies. It made me feel good finding such a healthy lunch option for her on the go. Lastly, I was able to eat my pita and boy was it delicious! I don't know what about it makes it so good (I think it's the sauce), but I want to come here after every visit to the museum and feast my face on this tree of life.

I was going to grab a mint, until I realized they were condoms. Then, when I took my daughter to the restroom, there were two other guys in there. My daughter was puzzled like \"why are there men in the bathroom?\" It was just a little strange to see men in our little sacred ground of a restroom. Lastly, there's a library here, and my daughter LOVES books so she runs over and grabs some books while I am ordering and paying. Yes, I know that I should have been watching her more carefully, but since we are at least once a week library frequenters, I figured she would be fine. When I'm done ordering, I walk over to her and her friends, and I notice that it's a LGBTQ library. Some of the books have photos on the front that are not appropriate for little children. Several have textual content that is definitely not appropriate for children (luckily none of them can read, they're 4 and under). After I noticed this, I told them they couldn't get any more books. When I talked another friend of mine who recommended this place to me, I told her what had happened and she was shocked, because her kids have also grabbed books to look at while waiting.

Good coffee has a robust taste, it is not exactly watery, nor is it creamy, it is a good in-between. Good coffee can be drunk without cream and sugar because the taste of the coffee is neither really bitter, biting, nor is it totally flat. The best coffee in my opinion comes fair-trade, organic, and brewed very well. \n\nSunrise Coffee has this kind of coffee. I was somewhat skeptical as to whether or not it would please me, even with the multiple Yelp reviews that say it is fantastic. But I confess, it was held up to all expectations and then some. I only ran in to grab a cup of coffee to go (I suppose I could have gone through the drive-thru, but I wanted to see the inside), but it is some of the best coffee I have ever, ever had.

While hesitating and cringing, she assured me that it was a better alternative and fewer calories. Not wanting to be one of those people who refuses to give certain foods another try, I trusted her, and caved. Before she started making it, she gave me the option of having Sriracha sauce.

A closer inspection reveals a wholesome little abode with a quaint little patio containing oddly awesome tables, and a sticker on the door proudly proclaiming its fair trade coffee usage.\n\nThe coffee house is populated with various art pieces, comfortable chairs (especially important for long study sessions), a couch and a bookcase full of reading material.\n\nAn initial glance at the menu left me in quite a conundrum -- did I want the Nutella or cr\u00e8me brulee latte? A tropical frappe or peach iced tea? The \"Candy Cane\" holiday espresso looked great too. With all these decisions, I decided to ask the barista, and ended up with the Nutella latte, iced, and also decided to give the \"Alien Burrito\" a try.\n\nThe Nutella latte was absolute deliciousness -- a blend of indulgent decadence,  perfectly balanced with the espresso. My only regret was not getting a larger size. Fortunately, while Sunrise strives for wholesome, organic food and coffee, their prices are still very reasonable, with a large 20 ounce gourmet latte only running $4.45, and the same size frappes only going for $4.85. Why do I ever go to Starbucks?\n\nNext up was the \"Alien Burrito\" (full title: \"Aliens Left a Burrito in the Middle East\"),  made up of couscous, beans, cheese, hummus, spinach, tomato, avocado, red bell pepper, cilantro and ranch, all housed within a spinach tortilla. Most know me as a bit of a carnivore, but despite a lack of meat, this burrito was delicious. And if you look at the ingredients, you can see why. The best part? It runs about the same price as a burrito at Chipotle or a sandwich at Subway.\n\nI don't know why I ever had the whole \"Oh, organic? It'll probably be overpriced\" misconception, but Sunrise Coffee has quickly changed that.

It is spacious and offers plenty of seating. The lighting is dim and relaxing and the music is not played so loud that you cannot hear yourself think. It is the perfect spot to work, study, or just meet a friend. Don't believe, go check it out and you can see people doing all of the above!\n\n4.

What I found at Raw Food Express was simple, straightforward fare. \n\nI ordered the zucchini wraps which was about all they had left in the cooler for the day. It was about three thin slices of zucchini wrapped around a prettily diced medley of bell peppers, radish and cauliflower. This came with a coconut water, Braggs and Tahini dipping sauce. The wraps themselves were hard to eat as they were falling apart, but the cool crunchiness was welcome after braving the 105 degree weather outside. The sauce was unbalanced. It had a slight creaminess thanks to the Tahini, but mostly it just tasted of the Braggs- salty. For these three little wraps, I paid $10.

He'll take his time with you and explain everything, making you feel very comfortable.

Most of the meat substitutes found in stores do not measure up to whatever they used as chicken-less chicken in their spicy buffalo wings. They were so flavorful, had a great meat texture, and the ranch dressing to cool it all off was delish. I can't wait to have them again! We then tried the Green Hummus. Again, very flavorful, the green part coming from a creative use of Poblano Peppers and drizzled with a little sesame oil. I thought the pita chips were a little greasy and since I try not to eat fried foods very much, I thought it would be cool if they offered and un-fried option but they don't. Then again, I didn't ask. Whatever they used to season the chips with was also very good and very flavorful. We then embarked upon the crabless-puffs. Nothing remarkable but for a creamy fried (Ughh) little puff, it was great. The \"Green\" salad was kind of blah compared to everything else we had, but it was fresh and organic and made me feel better about myself after munching down all the fried stuff. The service was super fast and friendly. I thought the pricing was dead-nuts. Even the bathrooms were cool! We can't wait to go back and try more things! We have a great appreciation for restaurateurs who actually pay attention to detail and take the time to develop a creative and super flavorful menu like this.

It's much smaller and it's soy based and tastes worse than a Boca patty. If I wanted a crappy little frozen soy patty, I wouldn't pay nearly ten dollars for it... \n\nThe fries, which were also amazing at the other location were nothing special here either. They are supposed to be seasoned - they are called \"Thyme Fries\" so I expected some, I don't know, thyme?  Nada - no seasoning whatsoever. They were good but just plain old fries. \n\nIt wasn't just me. My husband who has 16 years of vegetarian/vegan experience and who really enjoyed the Argentine Po-Boy previously just looked at me and said \"no bueno\".

That means no dairy, eggs, gelatin, etc. However, their food isn't 'healthy'. That's not a dig-they do casual, 'comfort'-style vegan food that you'd be hard-pressed to distinguish as being vegan.  With mac and cheese, burgers, rice/noodle bowls, salads, buffalo wings, etc, green has a little something for just about any craving. \n\nAfter your meal, go next door to their joint dessert/coffee bar and snag yourself a tsoynami. Just. Do. It. \n\nThe (few) downsides-\n\n\nThey changed their menu a few months ago, and I was pretty bummed-some of the items that I loved and ordered regularly throughout the years were replaced. I was kind of disappointed when they first rolled out some of the new items, but it's definitely gotten MUCH better/consistent. \n\nI've gone with a few non-vegan/vegetarian friends, and while all of them have been pleasantly surprised with the food they've ordered, sometimes the staff hasn't been too keen on explaining things, making substitutions, etc. That's kind of a bummer.

Once we made our selections, we ordered at the counter, then sat down and waited for our food.\n\nI started with a locally brewed beer -- Four Peaks Peach Ale. Then, our appetizers started arriving. First, we had the green hummus made of garlic, poblano chilies, and chickpeas with fried pita. This one was a winner.\n\nNext,we had the spicy buffalo wings, which were probably my favorite item from the whole night. They were tender with great spice and served with a delicious vegan cucumber ranch.\n\nOur last appetizer was the samosas filled with curried potatoes, peas, carrots, and garlic served with a tamarind dipping sauce. These were okay, but nothing to write home about.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the Clexico Burger. This was their homemade burger with organic garbanzo hummus, cheddar cheese, mayo, and spicy chipotle sauce. The burgers were a bit too meaty for me and not vegetably enough, if you know what I mean. And there were no veggies -- no lettuce or tomato so it was just a lot of fake meat with a nice chipotle sauce. I thought the burger was good, but definitely not what I should have ordered given the other healthy options.\n\nI ended up wishing I had ordered the Singapore orange bowl that my friend had. Filled with fresh broccoli, zucchini, and faux meat, it was delicious.\n\nAnother girl got the Coconut Curry Bowl filled with broccoli, zucchini, and potatoes in a curry sauce.\n\nMy out-of-town friends tried their famous version of a Big Mac, the Big WAC! This was way too much burger for me. It was two patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame bun just the way I remembered. I have to admit that it was good, just too meaty and too much.\n\nIn the end, I was so glad I chose this place. Though I wish I had ordered the fresh bowls, I was still satisfied with everything I tried and some items were exceptionally good. All of our bowls and sandwiches were about $9 so pretty cheap. And I love that they offer beer, wine, and soft serve ice cream.

We had plenty of time on the beautiful NYE 2013 afternoon to enjoy the sun and perfect temperature in the EZ AZ! \nWe walked in and were treated by a really sweet smile from the only person in the home. It was really like we walked into her personal kitchen!  We sat down (at one of the few tables inside the house) to look at the menu.  We finally made our decisions after a couple other families ordered before us.  As I mentioned, she was the only one working at the time.  And like I also said earlier, we had PLENTY of time to take for ourselves today so we were in no rush!  Our order took quite a while to come out, but I can not tell you how long only because I was not worried about time.  We were loving the glorious day, reading and observing the neighborhood.  (Outside there are about 5 tables to sit and enjoy your meal).\nOur experience at Aside of Heart was more like a 4 course lunch!! It was great!  The sweet woman brought out our smoothies first.  I ordered the Deep Purple (dark cherries, cocao powder, thai tea, and almond milk) and my lovey dovey ordered the PichuCherry (pichuberries, cherries, coconut water).  Both completely satisfying.  More time went by and the woman's partner arrived.  He brought out the miso soups promptly.  This guy was so polite and friendly.  The miso soup was very simple but a better miso than I have had at some Japanese restaurants. Ya know how some misos you encounter can be super salty?? Nope not this one. Brothy with some greens. You can add organic sprouted tofu if desired.  And then some more time went by when he brought out the jackfruit taco plates! Oh my!! Freaking perfecto! Again, the ingredients were few but blend perfectly together.  Tender jackfruit with cabbage salad and a spicy sauce layered on little tortillas.  When we were finished we walked inside to pay and of course, to order desserts!  Chocolate brownie and little heart shaped, gooey, nutty, date/fig bites.  My favorite way to end a date filled with yummy food and love!\nThe entire meal was so simple yet filling without making you feel bloated and heavy. \nAside of Heart is an affordable, local, hip, small restaurant full of positive energy, live music, open mics, art exhibits/gallery, and love!  It's also open late in the heart of Roosevelt Row!  Perfect place to relax and enjoy some amazing, HEALTHY food made from the heart.\nI do not believe that orders take as long as they did for us in most occasions.  But if it is normal, people that are impatient or are on a tight schedule should be prepared to just take a moment to relax and breathe! I promise your food will always be a bit tastier with time :)\nThank you Amanda and Nathaniel!

Niche: vegan. Niche: Mexican. Niche: expensive (in a part of downtown not known for it). Niche: clubby, youthful atmosphere. Niche: opens late and only takes cash. As a vegan and Mexican food fan, I want this place to succeed. But my fear is that is so specialized, its net is too small to catch a viable customer base. \n\nThe place looks like a bar, and it appears it wants to be more of a club than an eatery, though as of now it serves no alcohol. It earns the dubious distinction of being both the darkest and loudest restaurant I have ever eaten at (5 continents, 20 countries). What's wrong with that? Plenty: the waiter couldn't hear us, we couldn't have dinner conversation, we couldn't see our food (not good for eating nachos), and it was completely impractical for the average client. Fun? Maybe to the youthful crowd; otherwise it just detracts from the primary objective of eating. Atmosphere should enhance the experience, not obliterate it.\n\nThe menu is very small. We had the nachos, which were delicious. Two small tacos came with a small salad (around $10). The tables are lit from underneath glass with colored lights, which look cool, but didn't allow me to see what I was eating. Water was free, and tasted like cucumbers, and I had a grapefruit soda  -- which required shouting, then pointing to the menu to communicate to the waiter over the pleasant but very loud electronic music, to order it. The food was good, warm, and so was the air, I am guessing 80+ degrees. Maybe that was the reason for opening so late (weak a/c?).\n\nNo ask for dessert, no bill, the waiter told us the total -- well, he yelled it. One order of nachos, 2 orders of tacos, one soda: $33 + tip. \n\nIt's new, so I'm betting on some improvements.

I mean, how many times can you recall standing at a door after 5:00pm waiting for something that was supposed to open at 5:00pm, all while you watch the employees inside ignore your existence pending the hostess whose watch is 5 minutes slow coming up with the energy to finally open the door and acknowledge your presence on their time?\n\nThis employee was sweet, sincere, informative, helpful, and absolutely genuine in his apology. There was no way to be upset upon talking to him about the situation and why the restaurant was closed. The people inside absolutely wanted to work; it was just out of their hands.\n\nThe ultimate reason that I'm writing this review is because of what happened after. As we sat in our car trying to yelp other options for vegetarian restaurants in the area, that same employee came out of a side door and approached our car, still apologizing for what we were already good on, and offering to make us potato and chorizo tacos as he did have all ingredients present for that. For as wonderful as that sounded, we politely declined as that poor fellow had enough to worry about that night. \n\nFor a minute or so after, we just sat there in awe at how what could have been a terrible first time at Tediberto's was spun into an amazing customer service experience thanks to that one friendly employee who answered the door.\n\nSign or no sign, hours posted or not - we will be back!", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 2, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "Okay, I'm stopping in to update my review because I was finally able to experience the glory that is Tediberto's last night. Per the previous fellow's request, I subscribed to Tediberto's on Facebook and was able to know with 100% certainty that they would be open. If you're not already subscribed, do it now! Not only do they let you know the hours for the day, but they also tell you about the specials.\n\nWhen I got to the door, the very same employee who helped me out before greeted me and we were served by another fellow who was equally as charming and terrific at his job, completely allowing me to negate every person on here who ever wrote  a single bad thing about the service here. I don't know about before, but the service is top-notch, so if you had a bad experience in the past, go back and give them a second chance. They absolutely deserve it. Besides, I know you've been dreaming about those nachos ever since.\n\nSo, what good would a review be without a review of the food?  I'm from Chicago where we have two vegan/vegetarian Mexican restaurants that are both spectacular, but Tediberto's somehow manages to put them both to shame. We ordered the tacos on special and the No Whey Jose Nachos and every bit of it was phenomenal. I even later learned that there was cilantro in the tacos and I somehow didn't even notice. This is a huge deal because the mere presence of cilantro is generally enough for me to start side-eyeing all of my dining companions to question who could have possibly poisoned my food or at least sprayed it with Lysol, but I was completely oblivious to its presence due to the amazing flavors that were abundant within the best tacos I've had in years.\n\nIf they were open 24 hours a day, I would insist that you go right now, but, just to be safe, go like them on Facebook and double-check the hours and make sure you go as soon as they're open again.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Very cool atmosphere and the Nachos were outstanding, nice and spicy hot.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Delicious!!

And usually frying at least one of those.  WIth this in mind, I truly have no idea why I tried a Chef Sara's Vegan Cafe.  Either way, I am  extremely glad I did.  I have since been back twice for lunch so this review will focus on the lunch options.\n\nAt face value, the lunch was pricey.  Each entree was $16 so you can plan on spending at least $20 for lunch once you include tip.  But once you eat, you realize that you are paying for HIGH QUALITY food (which I am ok with).  If you prefer a larger amount of crappier food, I suggest Golden Corral.  The food from Chef Sara is outstanding and homemade, and many people don't realize how labor intensive/time consuming creating raw-vegan food is. The price is fair given the VALUE .  And value is clear once you try the food.\n\nAdditionally, the human body knows exactly what to do with the ingredients, so you are left feeling satiated.  The trick is to eat, then wait about 15-20 minutes before you decide if you are still hungry. I finished eating at 12:30 and was full until dinner at 6:30. Keep in mind I usually eat about 4-5 plates at an Indian buffet and down 40oz steaks like they are SLIDERS.  I once ate 14 HOTDOGS at a baseball game... and yeah, Chef Sara's little sandwich kept me until dinner.  Wasn't expecting that...\n\nSERVICE: The service was exceptional, though both times the place was fairly empty, so I was able to talk to Chef Sara personally.  She was very kind and very helpful when deciding what I should try.  THe food was made quickly, I was in and out in about 30 mins (I even took my time eating).\n\nDECOR: The decor....well... it is relaxing and all that, for those that care (I don't).  \n\nFOOD: The flavor of the food was great.  Nothing was bland.  The rawrgasmic sandwich was flavorful.  The quiche was very dense and filling.  My only complaint was that the quiche had a VERY strong garlic flavor, which was fine with ME....but not so much with the people I had to talk to for the rest of the day.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:  Men will like it because you can impress people with how open-minded/worldly you are that you eat raw-vegan.  Plus it is filling and very healthy.  Women will like it becasue of the presentation of the food and the health value. It can be a pricey lunch but the value is certainly there.

It wasn't busy, but there were a couple of other patrons.  I was by myself and couldn't help thinking my boyfriend might squawk at this food decision (and the overall ambiance - too new age-y for most dudes I've dated).  However, once a guy tastes the food, I am sure he would be impressed.  They have a vast menu, but the server let me know what was available (they make everything fresh).  As an appetizer, I had a shot of wheat grass (and the waitress let me know the best way to consume it -- holding it in your mouth and swishing it around before swallowing).  For the main course, I went with the Veggie Burger, which was more like a reverse veggie burger (two raw onion bread patties on the outside and filling on the inside).  I don't like mushrooms so the waitress substituted hummus instead.  The sandwich was pretty large and very filling.  It came with a side of whipped, chilled butternut squash (?) which was delicious as well.  When I was done, Chef Sara greeted me personally.

Chef Sara then takes the finest raw materials Nature can provide and she creates truly unique, imaginative, and innovative meals (see pics) like nothing else in the entire Valley!  \n \nIn fact, the food at Chef Sara's is so energizing, so nourishing, so delightful, that I eagerly make the 50-mile trip, each way, from Ahwatukee with my eyes full of wild anticipation all the way there; and then there's a bright, satisfied light coming from those from same eyes all the way back - as a warm glow envelopes every inch of my soul.  \n\nThe food at Chef Sara's is the elixir of life, and she does it up right. Every bite, an explosion of joy, an exclamation point of taste, as lustrous as silk rolling across my tongue. Each flavor is a moment to savor. My favorite is the RAWgasmic sandwich, a genuine foodgasm if there ever was one; as each glorious morsel that parades over my taste buds feels as if the bands are playing, the flags are waving, and the fireworks are flying! Though, in my mind, everything at Chef Sara's is first-rate, as if you're eating off a silver platter and drinking from a golden chalice. \n\nIn fact, I'd say that Chef Sara's is actually everything the more popular and venerated (Un)True Food Kitchen only portends to be. That's because the food at Chef Sara's is actually REAL, authentic, unadulterated, TRUE food.  And while I'm thinking about it, I'd venture to say that \"real,\" in anything, tastes better, looks better, feels better, and is more alluring, captivating, and appealing - to the all of the senses.  If you think about it, people are naturally more attracted to anything that is authentic; more attracted to the simple; more attracted to the healthy; more attracted to the happy! \n\nWe generally don't like the fake (unless it's fake fur/leather). We don't like fake in people (and all the lies/illusions/distortions/excuses/rationalizations/being emotionally frozen in childhood/etc.), and we certainly don't like the consequences of the fake. Even fake food has to made palatable so its makers can brag about it being \"real\" and \"authentic.\" It's not. Putting a disguise on something that's inherently phony cannot suddenly make that something \"real.\" My fellow Yelpers, you can't fly like an eagle with the wings of a wren. There's nothing like being REAL. Nothing.\n\nAnd no one does REAL better than Chef Sara. She doesn't need to brag about her food. (Only the fake needs a trumpet to brag about its alleged virtue and quality.) The food at Chef Sara's speaks for itself. And nothing's more REAL than when all the sugarcoating has worn off; when the mask has been chucked aside; when all pretense has been dropped; when all the lies have been untangled; when all the illusions have been stripped away; when the true colors are on display and all that's left is the absolute, unvarnished truth. Chef Sara's is real food; real flavor; and real healthy.

I had to visit my Uncle at the VA everyday and this was my lunch spot. It never looked clean. \nSecondly, their kids meals are disgusting. My son loves sushi, not so much the kids meal. The rice is stale and absolutely different and gross tasting. He likes salmon on his roll, when I asked the charge they told me 0.75 extra, but they charged me for a full add (2.50). Since they only gave me half of the normal serving (since the roll is half the size), but charged me full, I asked for them to add the other piece to the side, which they refused! They made such a huge condition about it that it was embarrassing. \nThirdly, their employees that have been there are fantastic. The new ones are pretty horrible.

In fact, the people behind the counter say the same thing.   But they also have set menu sushi combos as well in case you don't want to try to make your own combo.  \n\nI tried their Five Alarm, since so many here said how good it was.  Then, I attempted to put my own combination together with tempura shrimp, crab, cucumber, green onion, soy paper, white rice, sesame seeds, and spicy mayo.  I looooooved being able to get soy paper because I like it way more than seaweed!  Sadly, it wasn't flavorful enough because of my choices I put together.  But the Five Alarm was pretty tasty and perfectly spicy without being over the top...if you are used to spiciness that is.  \n\nMy hubby decided to go with their combos and ordered the Beefinator and Funky Fresh Chicken.  I had mentioned to the gal behind the counter that it was his first time having sushi since he is allergic and I'm glad I did because she was on top of it enough to use a clean knife to cut his rolls instead of putting in their automated cutter.

A thin schmear of beans...a bit o' lettuce and tomatoe drizzled with a vegan sour cream...and some small sides of guacamole and salsa. It was all flavourful...there was just so little of it.\n\nBut the jerk tempeh plate was just a joke. It came on a HUGE platter, and there was a lot of bare ceramic in front of me. A small scoop of rice with a few sauteed peppers and pineapple chunks on the right and 4 thin slices from the smallest sweet potatoe you ever saw. The tempeh? Oh, yeah, 5 1-inch cubes mixed in the rice. I almost missed them...especially because I gave 4 1/2 of them to my nephew, since there was so little food. The half bite I had could, I suppose be called jerk tempeh...only because I felt like a jerk for ordering it. There was no spice, no flavour. Just sweetness from the pineapple and peppers...maybe a hint of allspice on the potatoes. I was so upset...were I not still quite sated from brunch, I would have been a downright beast at about this point. \n\nNevertheless, I knew that I would be quite hungry later, so we got a piece of cake to take away. Then we waited for the bill. And asked. And waited. And waited. And watched the servers make VERY questionable serving decisions. And waited. And waited. Went to the toilet (seriously, go for this alone...there is an exhibit in there that will just leave you laughing...apples. candle. urinal.). And waited. And I went and cleaned our car while mum waited. And then, it reached the point where she had to yell to get their attention -again. It was ridiculous. As were the prices.\n\nSo, a very mixed review.

My wife and I tried a couple of wraps, one with side salad and one with quinoa pilaf, and a salad with chickpeas and tomatoes with tahini dressing, and a large batch of hot herb tea, which is served in a French press.  The salad came with some amazing bread, an olive bread and a cranberry/raisin bread, which they said is from Simply Bread (I asked, it was that good).  It was all very delicious and inspires me to try to make some similar dishes at home.  The total was just under $50, but it was way too much food; next time we will probably just share one wrap ($13) and one salad (varies).  The tea is a good deal, $6 for a large or $2 for a small, and they put such a large quantity of herbs in it that I think at their prices for herbs, the cost would probably be about the same if you made it yourself.  There are many varieties to choose from, which they mix up themselves, with various therapeutic properties.\n\nAs for buying herbs, they have everything, and as others have mentioned it's probably a good place to get some herbal advice, but the herbs are quite pricey.  After the Gentle Strength Coop was kicked out of their old digs and subsequently failed, there hasn't been much choice, but you can get a few bulk herbs cheaper at Sprouts (much fewer, actually).  I wish there was a cheaper option in this area of town, with a comparable selection.\n\nAn example... my wife likes to make tea from linden leaves ( in Russian).  In her home town, these trees line the streets; they are as ubiquitous as oleanders are here.   At Chakra 4, the leaves are sold for multiple dollars per ounce.  It's hard to believe they don't grow in abundance nearby too, perhaps in another state.  Somebody is making a lot of money from something which is not a scarce resource at all.

If we have them, they're packaged up by the counter.\" And she literally waved her hand in the direction of the counter and turned her back on me.  Hmmm.  Not rude exactly, but I'm not singing customer praises either.

That little plastic container cost $1? And they threw in a fork and spoon, which I didn't need.  If you're going to be eco, start asking people if they need utensils.\n\nThe food? Good. The $3.50 iced tea? Not good. After the to-go charge for the plastic container and utensils I didn't need, I spent close to $20 for a wrap, side of quinoa and iced tea.

They serve Royal (@ the Market), for those interested.\n\nBeing pretty hip to the coffee scene in PHX, I was a little surprised to hear of this new shop, having not heard of it's coming.  Maybe I didn't look around enough, but it felt like Nami just kind of popped up.\n\nSo I had my doubts, as I always will when giving a new place a shot.  The layout was pleasant, and the decor pretty rad; love the couch.  Parking seems sorted out a great deal better than when That's A Wrap inhabited the area -  good plus there.  Sweets looked great.\n\nSo I order my typical - drip and a 2x (on the side).  This gives me a general idea of the shop; milk drinks are for second and beyond trips.  Firstly, their demi-tasses are super cute.  Obviously hand-made, and hopefully local.  Loved it.  My drip actually turned out to be a pour-over, which is a plus to me.  A coffee junkie can appreciate a pour-over, where it kind of scares a person just wanting some \"coffee\" (see: I understand why you call it drip vs pour-over).\n\nStraight up espresso is generally a quick way of determining bad-average-good.  Crema was nice though, consistent, and had me thinking I might have a decent thing here.  Taste was good, creamy and quite chocolatey (which seems the profile of the beans being used - the drip was reminiscent of the same).  Said and done (from a 'snob' standpoint), the espresso was good, not mindblowing.  I think the grind was right, but either the dosing could be moved up a tiny bit, or tamped a little harder.  Granted, this was the first and only I had there, so I can't necessarily base the entire shop on that one dopio.  All in all, I'm saying it was good, and while the extraction time was right, it could use a little more density.\n\nThe drip (see: pour-over) clearly used the same roast, which isn't a complaint.  The same chocolatey, creamy notes were abound.  I feel the dosing was very light, and should have either been a 12oz, or more grounds used.  I actually felt I was drinking a water heavy coffee.  Not terrible, but certainly not great.  I have a sneaking suspicion if the measurement was a bit closer, it would have been a much better brew.  Pour-overs are an art first, for sure, then a science.  I think they have potential here.  Maybe a better pot would help with this brew method as well.\n\n\n-- I'll be back.  My experience was neither mind-blowing nor off-putting.  I'm hoping after they get into the swing of things and get the kinks ironed out, this will be one of the cooler stops in PHX.

The MASH - If you're feeling daring, this is a fun way to spin the wheel of dessert fortune. I've ended up with a carrot cake tsoynami and a mint chocolate chip one.

They also have a chai cupcake which has a cinnamon-like icing on top... yum yum!  They have snicker doodles with icing sandwiched in between and mini-cookies to scarf down.  Everything is vegan!  They are famous for something known as a soy-nami but I've never made it to the vegan ice cream!  I'm always opting for the aforementioned sweets!  If I ever get to one, I will review again...

I'm lactose intolerant and love blizzards, so it's a match made in heaven. I go to Green a lot as I live nearby, and have never felt unwelcome there, so I had no reason to think I'd feel that way about their sister joint, Nami. So after a disappointing dinner at Nobou at Teeter House in downtown phx, bf and I were excited to turn our night around with dessert at Nami when we realized we were super close to it and it was still open (since Green would have been closed by the time we got there). Their hours posted indicate they close at 9:30pm on Fridays, and we arrived at 9:20 after calling to confirm they were still open. \n\nWe walked in, and there were a few groups of people sitting and leisurely enjoying their ice cream and baked goods. We walked up to the counter and bf knew what he wanted right away (s'mores tsoynami with pb added...SO good!). I, on the other hand, needed a minute to decide since they had a huge bakery case filled with things I never see at Green and wanted to try out, in addition to the full tsoynami menu. \n\nI asked a few questions, which the light-haired woman working there was happy to answer. She disappeared to make bf's tsoynami, though, and we were then met with an icy stare and complete annoyance by the dark-haired woman working there. I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, and hey, it's Friday night and she probably wanted to close up so she could go out. But it wasn't even 9:30, and she had zero interest in making this customer happy. \n\nI said I was debating between a cookie and a tsoynami, while she rolled her eyes and continued to tap her fingers on the counter. Her response, rather than a suggestion or recommendation for something to order, was, \"We close in five minutes.\" Ok? I know that already? Why wouldn't you just try to hurry us along in a constructive way, rather than making me feel afraid to ask you any questions about your products?\n\nShe continued to sigh and look around, willing us to disappear, and honestly I wish we would have left right then. But we were starving, and I really wanted to enjoy one of their delicious looking treats. I decided in my head that I wanted a tsoynami, but I was way too afraid to have that lady actually prepare something for me as I was pretty sure she would spit in it, in addition to the length of time it would have taken to prepare which surely would have put us over her 5-minute limit. I said I'd take the cookie, to get us out of there sooner. We still had to wait another minute for bf's tsoynami to be finished, and felt her stare us down the whole time. Mind you, there are still parties of other customers at tables still lingering. We were definitely NOT responsible for keeping them open, but we sure were made to feel that way!\n\nI don't care how tasty your treats are, I would never EVER go back there...who wants to leave a dessert place with such a sour taste in their mouth?

I ended up ordering a dozen carrot cake cupcakes (with vegan cream cheese frosting) and a dozen cranberry nut oatmeal cookies. \n\nThe presentation of the cupcakes were great, and while I didn't get a chance to partake in them, I heard from my friend (he was the birthday boy and vegan) that they were absolutely delicious. \n\nI took home the cookies for myself and my husband. While my husband did not enjoy them as much as I did (he is not particular to the taste of flax or egg based substitutes), I was very thrilled with the texture and taste of the cookie. While they were a bit on the drier side when it comes to oatmeal cookies, the cookie was overall scrumptious, had a tasteful number of nuts and berries, and was both sweet and salty. \n\nI highly recommend that you try Treehouse Bakery! \n\nYou can contact them via email - by phone or through their etsy website.

And her face lights up at the chance to show you that vegan cupcakes can in fact be a delicious alternative.\n\nA friend of mine just had a baby and she's a vegetarian who's aspiring to be as vegan as possible.  Like so many women I know she's also got a big time sweet tooth.  I'd driven by Treehouse and had seen the great ratings this place garnered on Yelp, so I figured this place would be golden.  Their offerings change daily so there's no menu to view online.  You'd either have to call the shop, read their Facebook page for menu updates, or stop in and check it out.  Being just down the street, I figured I'd stop by.\n\nThe location is just up the road from Bragg's Diner (another popular Vegan establishment) in an old building on the corner of Grand & Roosevelt.  There's plenty of parking so you don't have to worry about street meters.  The inside is relatively small and simple, with the baking area right behind the display case for all to see.  As you'd expect being on Roosevelt, there's plenty of local artworks on the walls as well.\n\nI figured the place would be dead on Sunday around lunchtime, but there were three couples in line in front of me.  Two of which were picking up large to go orders.  The display case had a pretty wide array of cupcakes, cookies, bars, and even scones to choose from.  Based on the Yelp reviews it seems the cupcakes are the stars here, so I grabbed four individual ones.  A vanilla and chocolate cupcake for the sake of tradition.  And to mix it up I got a strawberry chocolate swirl and a salted caramel.\n\nThe strawberry chocolate swirl cupcake has chocolate strawberry frosting and the cake itself had real strawberries embedded in the chocolate cake.  Absolutely awesome.  The salted caramel cupcake is admittedly a hot mess as my fingers got super sticky caramel all over, but delicious nevertheless.  The vanilla and chocolate cupcakes were both exactly what I expected.  Simple, tasty, and just the right amount of frosting and cake moisture.  What a treat.\n\nI've alerted my friend about this place and I'm pretty sure she's going to demand a full box of cupcakes or maybe even a full size cake from here pretty soon.  Just an FYI, for a full size cake they usually ask for 48 hours notice before pickup.  For other desserts it sounds like you can just call a couple hours ahead and they'll have some ready for you when you come by.

It was a cold Wednesday night so they weren't terribly busy, so we got a lot of attention without them being overbearing.  We even were told history about the building and family, and were humorously corrected about our erroneous assumption that being a veg restaurant, they were somehow intertwined with Bragg's Liquid Aminos, a vegan seasoning with a cult following.\n\nNow, for the food.  I had the fresh squeezed lemonade which was the perfect blend of tart and sweet, and they even gave me a refill to go at the end, which was great for the ride ahead.  Mr. Cake got the \"How Funky is Your Chickpea\" burger and loved it, only remarking that he wished he had a more plentiful serving of the rosemary potato side, which he really dug.  I had the \"Bwiscuits & Gwavy\" (hilarious to say out loud - go ahead and try it, you sound like a drunk toddler) with a side of hashbrowns.  The biscuits themselves were large and perfect, but I was surprised with it arrived and the gravy wasn't at all what I expected.  It was more of a dark brown stew that had poblanos and a lot of white kernal corn in it.  It was not bad, but it wasn't what I wanted, which was the more traditional seasoned white gravy with what I hoped would be faux sausage in it.  If I was in the mood for what I got, I would have liked it, however, I was a little disappointed to not have to comfort food I was envisioning.  The hashbrown side was fantastic however, and was really cool in texture - the potatoes were shredded much more fine.  I was pleased as punch that they had Tapatio as their hot sauce, and doused my hashbrowns per the ushe.  Tapatio is clearly the most superior of hot sauces, with Cholula taking a close second.  Tabasco is an abomination and restaurants immediately lose points in my world if they have it.\n\nThe food made us very full, so we opted out of the slices of pie we planned on getting, and instead got a black and white cookie, which I've not had in ages as a vegan version is not available anywhere I've ever seen.  It was great, and wrapped up the meal well.  Clearly, they are known for their pie, and this was validated as about halfway through the meal, a solo customer walked in and ordered just a slice of pie and coffee.

It was a bit of a drive from where we were staying down on N. McDowell Road, but totally worth it!\n\nThe restaurant is a smallish (but very bright and cheerful) storefront operation in a large shopping complex a few miles north of downtown Scottsdale. The first thing that hits you, as you walk in, is \"wow...something smells fantastic!\" (always a good way to start a relationship with a restaurant!). Jasmine rice and ginger...one of my favorite combinations!\n\nWe chose to sit inside (there is what appears to be a good-sized patio seating area as well). I was very impressed by the d\u00e9cor, which was very bright, clean, and modern...despite the size and the location, it doesn't have the look or feel of a fast-food joint. Service was prompt, friendly, and knowledgeable.\n\nIt's always a bit overwhelming for us when we can eat anything on the menu without having to ask \"does this have meat in it?\" or \"is this cooked with fish sauce?\" so it took us a few minutes to decide what to have. We finally settled on an order of the fried imperial rolls to share. For our entrees, I went with the Golden Soy Chicken Delight (the words \"ginger sauce\" get me every time!) and my husband chose the Signature Lemongrass Curry (with the Japanese eggplant option rather than tofu). We were both pleased that they offer brown rice as an option (we'll eat white rice, but prefer brown).\n\nEverything is prepared fresh to order there, so we'd expected service to be a bit slow, and were pleasantly surprised at how quickly our appetizer came out. The imperial rolls were absolutely delicious! The texture of the taro-based filling was perfect, and the slight sweetness was nicely off-set by the tasty, vinegary, sauce that was served alongside. A single order was perfect for two.\n\nOur entrees came out shortly after we'd finished the imperial rolls, and it was love at first bite! I had planned to ask them if they make their own meat analogs and forgot, which is too bad, because the texture was unique and very pleasant (often meat analogs can have an unpleasantly chewy texture, but my \"chicken\" was nicely tender). The sauces were wonderful! Mine had a nice, gingery edge, and my husband's curry was deliciously complex, with a lovely lemony taste from the lemongrass.\n\nPresentation was very attractive. If I have to nitpick, the one thing I would change is the ordering of the food on the plate. Both our entrees had the rice and the saucy, meaty stuff separated by a large \"dam\" of lightly steamed vegetables, which made it difficult to combine the entr\u00e9e with the rice. The veggies were tasty and well-prepared, but there were too many of them and they were cut too large to make them easy to incorporate into the dish. I would suggest cutting them more finely and serving them on one side of the plate rather than between the rice and the \"meat.\" It's a very minor point, though.\n\nThe restaurant doesn't serve alcohol, so we both had tea with our meals. Soft drinks were also available.\n\nOne interesting thing, that some diners may want to know about...the restaurant is certified kosher! I overheard the owner speaking with a Jewish couple at a nearby table and evidently when they opened in the area, an early patron strongly advised them to get kosher certification, as there is a large Jewish community in that part of Scottsdale. It's nice to see a restaurant that is truly sensitive to the needs of the community in which it finds itself.\n\nAll in all, a very pleasant dining experience!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I love eating here because everything is soooo delicious and the best part is that it's healthy!!
