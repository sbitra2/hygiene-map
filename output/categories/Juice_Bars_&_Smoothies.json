To me, this place should be a slam-dunk.  They offer fresh food and healthy alternatives to the normal restaurant fare.  However, there are a few things that really bother me about this place.  Let me elaborate.\n\nThe first problem I've encountered is inconsistency.  I like going to places where I know that I can order the same thing more than once and get, well, the same thing.  Sometimes I get stuck in ruts and return to places over and over for a particular menu item.  That's how I know whether a place is consistent or not... and this place isn't.  I have ordered the same wrap (a BBQ chicken one) a dozen or so times.  Sometimes it absolutely blows me away.  Sometimes it is flavorless and skimpy on the filling.  Since I never know which way it is going to be prepared, I usually opt for other food places while I'm at The District.  The prices at Rachel's are similar to Panera, but at least I know how my Panera will taste.\n\nSecondly, the service is somewhat lacking.  At times, I've been greeted with a smile.  Other times, I am greeted with a huff.  It goes along with this consistency issue that seems to be a theme at Rachel's - I like to know that I'm not going to be punished because the person taking my order is having a bad day.  \n\nLastly, some of the tables are TINY.  Like, barely large enough for two people to comfortably fit their orders on the tabletop.  Last time I visited, my fiance ordered a salad and I had a wrap.  Once you added drinks and utensils to the mix, it was a cramped mess.  Between the crowded tabletop and the fact that the table was scooted waaaaay too close to the line of people waiting to order, I felt claustrophobic and wanted to leave.\n\nWhen Rachel's is good, it's some of the best food around.  When it's not, it feels like highway robbery.

The ingredients were good; however, they let you choose your bread, I chose wheat thinking it would be a wheat roll of sorts....it was like sandwich bread from the grocery store and it did not hold the sandwich contents in and got soggy quickly. This was pretty disappointing. The BF liked his sandwich, but, again, did not like the bread. The sweet potato fries were kind of on the bland side.

The wrap is a whole wheat wrap with bacon, eggs, cheese, and tomato.  I had them substitute the housemade salsa for tomato.  This was solid, but not spectacular.  The scramble on the other hand was excellent.  Spinach, bacon, chicken, with melted cheese.  Will definitely get this one again, the chicken and spinach are great together.\n\nBreakfasts come with potatoes, which are diced and fried.  No seasoning, which is very annoying.  It's the weakest part of what otherwise is a very good meal.  I liberally use pepper and hot sauce on them.  You can substitute fruit for $1.25, which we did the second time we ate here.  Melon and pineapple mostly.  It's a good serving size.\n\nThe wife had the favorite scramble, which has a bunch of veggies and goat cheese.

So i'll start with what I had each time. \n\nFirst time I went I got a Veggie Wrap which comes with a mixed green salad and their own fat-free balsamic vinaigrette. This was off the lighter side menu and had 315 calories. I loved the grilled veggies on the wrap and the vinaigrette had the perfect amount of tang. \n\nThe second time I went my husband came along. I ordered the Turkey club with turkey bacon instead of regular (It was awesome to have that choice!) on sourdough bread. With their sandwiches you have the option of ordering mixed green salad, french fries, sweet potato fries or onion rings! I went with the fries. I've had many, many turkey clubs, but this one has to be my all time favorite. It's not just a mash of sandwich! You can actually taste each layer as you bite into it!! The thick slices of swiss cheese were awesome! I also enjoyed the fries; they were very crisp and they serve them with a side of ketchup. My husband got the Sauteed Mushroom Burger.  It was very juicy and I loved that it came on a whole wheat bun. Again, the swiss cheese was thick and oozing! \n\nOn my third visit I went with my Dad. Rachel's is just up the street from his office and being that he has been dieting I knew he would find something to his liking here! I ordered the Smoked Turkey and Avocado sandwich on sourdough with the mixed green salad on the side. Let me say I do love their house vinaigrette. (I must not be the only one that likes it cause I noticed they sell bottles of it at the counter.) My sandwich was piled high with turkey, avocado and that thick cut swiss!!! Yum! You also get a huge salad on the side. My Dad ordered the Grilled Vegetable salad. It was huge and he said very filling. It was on the lighter side menu and it was only 159 calories. \n\nI have to mention I also am loving their organic green tea! I might as well of hooked up an IV bag of it to my mouth! \n\nAbout the decor and ambiance: it was OK at best. It can get really loud at times and the bench seats are not very comfy.

The chicken was thinly cut and grilled with the perfect charred taste. My mom and I enjoyed the other grilled vegetables like the bell peppers and zucchini that came with the salad, it was really refreshing! When I ordered the sandwich, the cashier asked if I wanted 2 or 3 pieces of sourdough bread and of course being so hungry i asked for 3.

I have downed probably 25 or more of these in my lifetime.\n\nSignature Pasta- this is pasta in a tomato sauce with chicken and a ton of vegetables in it- great for convincing yourself you are eating healthy when you may or may not be. \n\nGarden's Pasta- don't be fooled- despite having Garden in the name this is not a vegetarian dish, it has chicken in basically a carbonara esque pasta. \n\n440 sandwhich- chicken and tasty tasty goat cheese (which is pretty strong)- not for the feint of heart.\n\nGrilled Cheese- pretty good, although I would suggest subtracting all vegetables as an \"ultimate\" grilled cheese should not need them/they aren't a cheese. i know this- I put the ill in grilled cheese\n\nProtein Scramble(again, mind out of the gutter)- this is a pretty good breakfast- recommend a side of bacon... or five\n\nPancakes- Not my favorite but certainly passable/better than most breakfast places pancakes.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 7, "useful": 5, "cool": 4}}, {"text": "I want to love this place I really do.

It was pretty good. The bread was toasted just right and the cheese and chicken were in perfect amounts. I hate it when I get sandwiches where the meat is just completely overtaking the sandwich. Rachel's knows how to correctly make a sandwich. However - one complaint is that I wish there had been a BIT more avocado. I mean, I LOVE avocado and if it is on a menu then I'm definitely going to order it. \n\nI can see Rachel's being really popular during the day with really nice weather.

I am now 38 and a classically trained french chef.  So I walk in it looks nice, the tables need to be wiped down but it's lunch time and they look busy.  I walk up look at the menu and see that everything is $9 to $11.  Ok there must be something special about the sandwiches, wraps or salads that they charge that much for.  I order the Turkey Club, I am thinking \"ok for $11 maybe it is a Turkey Cutlet with some different type of mayo like an aioli  or cranberry or something.\"  Then my wife orders the Gorganzola burger and they ask how she wants it cooked she says medium.  So I say to myself \"wow, cool they are cooking to order instead of just shoe leather.\"   Then I order the Kids Pasta with Meat Sauce for my  3 y/o.  They asked me what side I wanted on my sandwich so I look up and they offer French Fries, Sweet Potato Fries, salad or Onion Rings.  I think \"wow I haven't had onion rings in a while I am excited I will get the onion rings.\"  My wife gets the French Fries.  We order three drinks and we are on our way.  Well we sit down inside and I realize they gave us only two cups.  So I go and ask for the third one that we paid for.  The lady who took our order hands it to me.  Then this Mexican guy says you already have three cups on your table.  I said no we don't we only have two and I ask him if he is calling me a liar?  He says no that I have made a mistake and that I have three on the table.  So now I am furious and tell him to come over to the table.  I count the cup for him and he says what about the water cup.  I said it is what they gave us for the lemons we asked for, for the tea.  I said we paid for 3 cups and I want three cups not two with a water cup.  And then he says sorry and goes back to the kitchen.  I am thinking wow are you kidding me that this guy is ready to throw down over a cup.  Then when it was his mistake he only appologises as he is walking back to the kitchen.  Then our meals come out. I look over my sandwich and there is nothing special about it at all.  It is lunch meat with lettuce, tomato and bacon on white bread.  They didn't even cut it they way a Club is supposed to be cut.  Then I notice my onion rings that I was excited about and there were only three onion rings. THREE!!!!!!!!.  Two of them weren't even that big.  So I ask the lady why I only got three onion rings and she says well that is our lunch portion and I reply well it certainly wasn't the lunch price.  Then she asks me if I want more and tell her no I don't want anything from this place.  Then of course my wife's burger is shoe leather and the best thing I can say about my kids pasta is that it had not taste to it.

The owners Gary and Lisa are dedicated to their craft and it shows in their meticulous preparation of the many varieties of beverage offered here. Smoothies are sweet and refreshing (and refreshing comes in as near necessity in the Arizona summers). Coffee is smooth and roasty and their americanos make for a great alternative to a cup of brewed heaven. \n\nAll of their coffee offerings are a blend of hawaiian and other arabica beans roasted to various degrees to bring a rich nutty sweetness. Additionally, they offer a 100% hawaiian coffee prepared in a french press which, as far as small franchise shops go, is a pretty rare treat. All of their beans are roasted within weeks of use (or sale) and they offer whole bean bags retail so you can bring the taste of Maui home with you to do with as you please.\n\nThe staff is friendly and helpful, you're greeting with an \"Aloha\" upon entering and left with a heartfelt \"Mahalo\" on your way out. Gary specifically is very knowledgable about the art of coffee brewing and constantly reminding the baristas to strive for the \"god shot\" - a 2 ounce, 24 second rich caramely double espresso shot which they add to all of their espresso beverages. \n\nCoffee Snob Section:\nThe espresso beans are ground just prior to pulling the shots, the shot timing is right on for a full 2oz and the flavor is typical Kona (nutty) with a mild caramel sweetness and finishes smoky. The roast is a tad dark to showcase the mild sweet floral notes of Kona but the blend itself is only 20% Kona to begin with (IIRC) so this is less of a gripe and more of \"just how it is.\" Also, I tend to prefer ristrettos (~1.5 ounce doubles from ~16g of coffee) but since the resulting espresso is mostly destined for sweetened lattes or frozen cappuccinos (their blended espresso smoothies) I won't be critical on this point.\n\nOverall, this coffee shop is exactly what it claims to be, and then some. The atmosphere is fun and \"islandy,\" the staff is helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly, the coffee is a notch above the rest of glendale's attempted coffee houses and overly scattered Starbucks, and the smoothies hit the spot on hot summer days.

They advertise cappuccino so I was really disappointed to see one of those automatic machines you see in a gas station. Cappuccino was no good obviously.\n\nSpeaking of cappuccino, the lady serving me didn't understand that cappuccino is not a flavor. I ordered a hazelnut cappuccino (which I threw away after one sip), and the lady brought out 2 drinks. I said I only wanted the hazelnut and she said I ordered the hazelnut and cappuccino. NO. Cappuccino is not a flavor! Anyway, the miscommunication was a little annoying.\n\nAs for the donuts, pretty great. I ordered 1/2 dozen - glazed, sugar, toasted coconut, original, and 2 pink sprinkled (for the kids).\n\nThe toasted coconut was PHENOMENAL! I will return just for that donut. The original was hard and stale, and the others were good but not mind blowing. I've had better at Bosa consistently.\n\nCustomer service was icy.

Outside of these items, the store was otherwise clean, particularly the case where the donuts are displayed, the register, etc. \n\nWe ordered out donuts, which is always a laborious process ... the people taking the order always seem to struggle with the idea that you don't have the correct names for every donut memorized, and as the orderer, I always forget that it is difficult for them to see me pointing at the donuts THROUGH the case. Even so, it would've gone much better if the woman helping us was a) friendly b) patient ... instead she impatiently asked in a rude tone \"is that all?\" after each donut ordered. \n \nThe drink selection is a bit weird - lots of bottled drinks in a large case to the side, but no fountain drinks, iced tea, etc. At $2ish each, drinks for 4 people made up about half the cost of our order. \n\nNow, the piece de resistance of our visit: napkins. After being handed the box containing our donuts, I turned to collect the necessary accoutrements so that we could sit down to enjoy them: napkins, for example. I stepped to the countertop near the doorway, which was littered with creamers, sweeteners, stir sticks, etc etc etc - everything you could possibly need for your coffee, but no napkins. So, I head back to the register and nicely ask for some napkins - I am handed three, yes THREE narrow, thin napkins, and had to beg her for a few more (she grudgingly handed me two more napkins) Ri-di-cu-lous. \n\nAside from all of that, the donuts were fresh, tasty, and way larger than I usually expect.

At the bottom of Victoria Street in the Grassmarket, this lovely little space is a real suntrap.

And Susan, the owner, has a cabinet of fabulous, fabulous shoes for sale that I always eye up over my latte then distract myself with a muffin... It definitely has personality!\n\nAnd as for the smoothies themselves? Oh my. I've sampled quite a few now, and watched the smoothie-crafting skills of the Hula girls. These ladies really know their fruit, chocolate and other magical ingredients. Yes, some smoothies contain dark chocolate, some even contain millionare shortbread. But generally when one wants a smoothie they're looking for a wee health kick. And look no further. My favourite is definitely still 'Sunshine in a Cup' but there are so many different combinations.\n\nThe health boosters are brilliant too. I was in one morning looking very poorly and was given an extra special blend with added echinacae. After 4 days of flu-y cold, the next day it was gone! Medicine of the gods I tell ye.\n\nThe porridge with berry compote is perfect on a cold winter's day. The bagels are very generously sized and mine came packed with bacon.

Some new juices have appeared on the menu - the aforementioned Popeye which is filled with Spinach being one of my favourites.\n\nFor a day when I'm feeling super hungry, the mexican tuna wrap provides a feast with the excellent, spicy guacamole a bonus.\n\nFor a morning when my yoga practice was particularly hard, and I'm at once thirsty and hungry, Sunshine in a Cup smoothie with a slice of banana cake (gluten free) does the trick.\n\nFor an afternoon when I'm tired and run down, I could skip coffee and have a Ginger Jack juice with extra fresh ginger, and an Energy Booster.\n\nThere are salads, wraps, bagels, fresh soups, porridge and fruit salad for breakfast, juices and smoothies all day long, and cakes that are supplied from several local Edinburgh cake-bakers (Mrs C, Love Pure Cakes, Peppers to name a few).\n\nAnd the new, wonderful addition to Hula? I believe they are now running Juice Detox programmes, whre you can pay a set fee and Hula will provide you with literes upon litres of juice each morning, which you drink all day. And that's all you drink. I won't go into the intricacies of a Juice Cleanse just now, but read any Yoga blog and you'll know that they're so hot and healthy right now. \n\nHaving tried a juice cleanse in the past, making the juices myself, I know that I didnt drink enough juice and probably get enough nutrients to supplement the lack of food I wasn't eating. But I believe everyone who has had the 4litres-of-juice-a-day Hula Juice Cleanse felt wonderful at the end. I shall be trying this programme soon, and reporting back on results.\n\nHula makes little rays of Sunshine in a Cup, and it is a little ray of sunshine itself in the Grassmarket.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 4, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "In a central zone, on one of the prettiest streets in the city, one wouldn't expect to find some of the best coffee in town.

I came in with a few friends I hadn't seen for ages for a refreshing drink on a relatively warm sunny day in February. My boyfriend had some sort of red berry smoothie with frozen yogurt, which was tasty, though considering the price the frozen yoghurt was hardly noticeable, and my friend's sunshine in a cup was apparently good. I had a ginger jack juice, which although refreshing, was no way as good as the ones I make at home with my juicer. I put in 4 carrots, an apple and a bit of fresh ginger, and out comes the most delicious concoction ever...  Unfortunately the hula juice was pale in comparison, it was too frothy and not tangy enough, I guess to save fruit?\n\nJuice aside (ironically considering this is a juice bar), the smoothies are really good, as is the coffee, and the choice for people with specific diets or intolerances/allergies is great. The location is convenient and it's a nice place to sit.

I like that it is in The Ogden, what I don't like is me driving past it twice looking for a place to park! *shakes fist* Well, I ended up metering, but I have gotten over that hump of going Downtown. So I meter. I don't care, pretty much every major city EXCEPT Las Vegas has meters everywhere for parking so I have come to terms.\n\nThis RK is set up quite the same as the one in The District with the great looking green-tiled tables and the nice snuggly cafe vibe. The employees were very sweet when I was here and offered honey/lemons for my tea and answered my questions regarding the soup of the day.\n\nI really was hankering for soup/sandwich combo which RK has for $9.75. I say that's a decent price especially since you get a bowl of soup, not a cup. \n\nTurkey/Bacon/Avocado Sandwich (on sourdough) & Potato Cheddar Soup - The soup startled me because when it came out it was bright orange. I was like, \"What is this trickery potato soup?\" But, as I spooned the deliciously pureed potato and cheese into my mouth I decided it was quite delicious. I am sure the orange hue comes from copious amount of cheddar cheese, so ya know, fat girl status up in here! As for the sandwich it was a bit of a let-down. The bread was dry dry dry and did not have the richness I was expecting from a nice sourdough. I have a suspicion it was day(s) old bread. And there was an extra piece of bread in it which I didn't care for and removed. The turkey was all right and in my wold avocados make anything better, so it saved the sandwich a bit but not much.\n\nPeach & Ginger Black Tea - I would come back for their teas to be honest. Sitting downtown sipping this amazing tea they have would be perfect on any winter day. I can't remember the name of the teas but the next time I go back I am writing it down in case I can get it for my own enjoyment at home.\n\nOverall - Food-wise could use a little work.

It's like a Tropical Smoothie meets Greens and Proteins meets Coffee Shop that was spliced with a healthy Egg Works. Lots of options meat, salads and vegetarian dishes, breakfast, coffee, smoothies. I can see this as being a healthy option for those doing shows, working out, training for fights, on Paleo or looking to indulge while staying healthy.\n\nI ordered three things, I like to eat what can I say? The best I can do to stifle my inner fat kid is to force-feed him healthy meals a majority of the time. 3 steps forward, one step back. Anyway, I got the bison cheeseburger, PH breakfast, and BBQ chicken bowl with quinoa (with BBQ sauce flavored with stevia instead of sugar, damn they're on it for those of you that like to drizzle sauce all over your food). A little more expensive from most places but about on par when I'm ordering things like bison, which isn't cheap. When I first started eating it, of course I wanted to compare it to Greens and Proteins but it's not really the same thing. Greens and protein is healthy and has good health alternatives for vegans and vegetarians but outside of several items it lacks sufficient protein options for me. So where Greens and Proteins lacks Protein House makes up in protein (meat, chicken, egg whites), alternatives for customized shakes, and smoothies, and easier to stay within how my friends and I eat. So can't really compare the two, they're both good. It's like comparing apples and oranges, both fruit, but they are both in different categories. \n\n In any event, they're still working out some kinks but this place has the potential to continue expanding and get better. Now I know some of you picky eaters will complain that it's just okay but I also heard this from the same person who dislikes fish and complains at sushi restaurants. Wtf! Hey it might just not be your thing. But it's simple, if you need your protein, you need your veggies, you need your carbs and you need healthy, this is the spot.

I mean, you can't mess up egg whites.  My hubby was disappointed in the Bison burger as he felt it was rather bland, nor real seasoning at all.  \n\nNow, the reason I gave them 3 stars was all about the service. Service here is horrible.  We ordered our food and it took 45 mins for it to all be completed.  There were two other couples that ordered ahead of us and were already seated when we walked in the door to order.  Several other groups of people were served before we were including the two couples already seated.  I went up to ask if our order was misplaced.  My hubbies burger had been sitting on the counter for 10 mins and they didn't call us as they were still making my order of pancakes.  \nOne of the other couples there said they had the same problem. \n\nNow the place itself is a great industrial design.

With a name like that, of course I need to see what's really going on.  Located off Eastern Avenue near LVAC and Gold's Gym, Protein House is another restaurant that offers healthy eats with a ton of protein. But to me, PH is not just another healthy meal stop. PH offers smoothies, breakfast, burgers, bowls, and salads. To order, you can either go straight to the counter and place your order off their menu. Or, you can take their order checklist, select your meal, and then hand it to the counter.  You also have the option to build your own burger, salad, and bowl.  Because this was my first visit, I decided on their biggest and baddest burger, their Muscle Builder Burger. This burger is 12 oz of ground Bison, onions, cheese, and Canadian bacon all served in a whole wheat bun. I had this medium well and swear that this is one of the best bison burgers I have ever had.  Most exotic meats like bison come gamey and with no taste. Here at PH, they found a way to create this burger with flavor.  By the way, trying to up your protein for the day? This burger has to be close to 70 grams of protein.  Yeah buddy!\n\nAs for the restaurant itself, I felt that it is a little small. But I love the ambiance, decor, and service. One things for sure, there's a ton of fit peeps eating here. I also got the opportunity to meet one of the owners, Andrew Bic. To be successful in any venture, it comes down to how you treat people. Andrew got this right. He took the time to chat it up, ask for suggestions, and gave a little insight of what PH is all about.  I didn't get the chance to meet the other owner, Larissa  Reis, but look forward to it on future visits.  If you're use to the taste that a 1000 calorie burger joint has to offer, then maybe Protein House is not for you.  If you're looking for some quality macros with high amounts of protein in a burger, then give Protein House a shot.  \n\nWish List:\n-Ostrich:  With about the same amount of protein as steak and with calories/fat that rival chicken, I think ostrich should be on their menu.\n-Nutritional Information:  For a place that specializes in selling healthy meals, I think this information is necessary.  Per the owner, this is in the works with a dietitian.\n\nPS: Like all other healthy eating locations (i.e Whole Foods, Greens & Protein, etc), expect a higher price tag here.

I thought for sure it would be a healthy menu that I could get something I would not regret eating.\n\nWalking in the Protein House, I felt a little uncomfortable, there was a huge guy, likely a body builder or fighter hovering over the cashier, and he didn't seem extremely friendly. But, I did take this as a good sign that bodies were the focus in this place and I liked that. \n\nI was right, it is a healthy menu, however I do have a problem with a place that calls itself the \"Protein House\" or \"Greens and Proteins\" for that matter and they have not gotten with the times, that a lot of people do not eat meat anymore. This place does get \"kudos\" for having a vegan protein on the menu, which Greens and Proteins does not, but its vegetarian and vegan options for food are a little on the \"down low.\"\n\nWhy don't you have tofu options for your salads, bowls, etc? or Gardein? Heck the Yardhouse has an entire Gardein menu, get a clue!\n\nThey have a black bean and quinoa veggie burger and a veggie bowl. The veggie bowl can be quinoa or brown rice and I love both, but they don't come with a sauce. So, I asked what the sauce was and they looked at me like I was crazy. It doesn't come with a sauce they said, do you want a sauce on the side, and I said yes. What do you have? \n\nThe girl was very nice and said we have bbq, teriyaki, balsalmic, blah blah many others. Ok, so I went with teriyaki as I am vegan and I figured this would be the least likely to get messed up with some cheese or cream or something so I chose that one. I specifically asked for NO mushrooms, its the one veggie that I hate.\n\nI had to ask how to get my bottle of water and it was uncomfortably quiet in there while I waited for my food, except for the massive TV with the SF 49r's game on and my six year old which were great contributions to the action. They have a table set up in the back that appears to be their office, I found that tacky... now I have some ideas if they want them to make that table cool and fit the theme, like make it a judges table, autograph table or nutrition booth or something, but to sit out there in the public like that is just unprofessional. \n\nWhen I did receive my food, it was FULL of mushrooms, but I was starving and it wasn't meat or cheese so I attempted to pick them out as I went along. The veggies were gorgeous, asparagus, peppers, cauliflower, zucchini and the quinoa was cooked perfectly. My only suggestion is for them not to cut the veggies up so small, this is the main part of the veggie dish and they were diced teeny tiny seeming like I was still missing the main dish.\n\nOh, the sauce... well the first sauce was my teriyaki and it looked creamy! How does teriyaki get creamy? I don't know, but I'm not eating it. I asked for something else, I got the balsamic. It looked chunky and not like any balsamic I have ever seen. So, unfortunately my opinion on the sauces is very poor. If you serve a bowl of any kind, don't you need a sauce?\n\nI guess I'm the only one who ever asked for a sauce as they looked at me like an alien when I asked for one. Last but not least. SALT. I know, its not the best for you, but I need flavor on my food.\n\nAt the Protein House, I walked around and found pepper but no salt. And, they couldn't find salt. I mean I know you are a bunch of manly and womanly body builder types, but 99% of the population wants some salt on their food.\n\nThey finally found me some in the kitchen in a cabinet and had to put it in a little dish for me. Wow, Gordon Ramsay would have had a hay day with that episode.\n\nAll in all, I appreciate the whole idea of the place, its supposed to be trendy and focused on body building, but they have to be realistic that the bodybuilding population is such a small percentage of their potential revenue, that they have to open their minds to all the other healthy people out there that might want to eat there.\n\nAfter today, I will not go back, unless of course I see a change of the way I was treated or (sized up), the menu and the atmosphere.

I called and said where are you located? And lord and behold...I talked to three different staff and noone could tell me how to get to the place at all. It was like talking to Larry, Curly, & Moe. (The Three Stooges) ...If your to young to know who they are google them. \nKeep in mind I was on Durango when I called. They gave me the run around and as adults/professionals its sad. Because I was not talking to children or teens. I was almost ready to give up and go home when I looked over to the right and bam I saw Rachel's Kitchen. Wow I was this close and they was busy telling me they next to subway. Hmmmm No they are not next to a subway. Shaking my head.\n Once I placed my order I had to wait almost 45 minutes to get my order. I had the pleasure of getting the turkey club & I had the pleasure of trying my very first smoothie ever. It was a peanut butter blast. It tasted very watered down. I could taste peanut butter tho it was just strange and weak. If this is what a smoothie is then I wont be trying another. (I don't crave water & peanut butter.)\n No one had cleaned the dining room. The table I sat at was dirty along with the table across from me and next to me as well. Once I did get my food I took it with home with me.  I can't eat in an environment if its nasty. I did do research before I went to this location I read other reviews. And I did have the pleasure of seeing other yelpers eating at the dirty tables as if this is just the place to hang out and chill. They never looked twice at the dirty floors or dirty tables. It made me wonder to be honest. The staff over all lack friendliness. And I did return with the husband we again took home our food. They really need someone to clean the eating area.\nTruth is this food just seems to be over priced and not enough love goes into the food. What I mean is this they tell you on a sandwich comes cheese, avocado, red onions and blah blah blah. But when you get the sandwich its like they going thru mad budget cuts. They don't put enough of anything on it. Its like I paid for this so how on earth are you gonna hold back my mustard. Now understand I'm not talking about extra mustard. What I mean is more mustard than a pen drop. If your gonna skim on putting my stuff on my sandwich then charge less. Why am I paying 12 bucks for a sandwich if you fix it as if I only paid 99 cents? I did take pictures on my last visit the eating area looked better. But they was extra slow still so I would tell you don't go if your hungry.

The sandwiches and pastas sounded good and they serve breakfast all day...sounded promising at first!  Who doesn't love breakfast food at dinner?!  Well...then we looked at the prices.  Holy smokes.  These portions better be good.  I ordered a breakfast burrito and paid an additional $1.50 to add bacon.  My husband ordered a BBQ bacon burger with onion rings and we split a small soda.  Total came to about $22.  Whoa...we could have eaten at a sit down restaurant for that price.  :\\  We then proceeded to wait for 20 minutes or so.  It seemed to take forever.  When we finally got our food, we were a bit disappointed to see the portions.  My husband got literally 4 onion rings on the side and I expected my burrito to be a lot larger for nearly $10.  My breakfast burrito was just ok taste-wise.  I didn't like how it was pretty much all egg with hardly any salsa and I could barely taste the cheese.  For some reason the avocado wasn't spread out evenly throughout the burrito, just a big chunk of avocado on the end of the burrito.  They need to distribute the ingredients more evenly to balance out the tastes.  The part that really ticked me off was the bacon I paid an additional $1.50 for...The bacon was just tiny little chunks sprinkled throughout the egg and there was hardly any of it!  Seriously?  I paid extra for this?!  I couldn't even taste the bacon in it so I feel it was a total waste to get it.

We have made the trip several times since discovering it and found each time that the food and service are outstanding. The food if fresh and made to order. The salads are wonderfully prepared. There have never been any issues with slight adjustments to the sandwiches that my sons order. Kid can be a little picky at time. The fresh pita chips are some of the best around. My boys will take those over chips and we are always buying a couple extra bags to take home. The smoothies are my boy's favorites. I also wanted to take time to recognize the owner. Each time we have come in he has always greeted us. He takes the time to get to know you and make you feel welcome. He is very hands on and does get behind the counter to assist and make sure that your experience is the best possible. I have seen a couple of the same employees there on multiple visits which is also a good sign.\nFresh food, great smoothies, outstanding service.

I've enjoyed breakfast and lunch/supper items as well as coffee, tea, and smoothies. \n\nThe smoothies are fresh and made from real ingredients. A list of ingredients is provided at the counter, so you can judge how thick it will be. If you don't get it made with yogurt or powders, it will be thinner, but it is still a smoothie. You pay a bit more for the convenience of the location and the freshness of the real food, but it's worth it! It could be argued that BOG is over priced, but you're paying for whole food, speed, and convenience of location. This is not your SAD (Standard American Diet) kind of place with SAD proportions.\n\nPersonally, I enjoy the Spinach Mango smoothie with whey protein; Mocha Smoothie with peanut butter or whey protein; and the arugula salad add chicken and goat cheese, substitute with BOG dressing.
