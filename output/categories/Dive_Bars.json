I see this place has amazing reviews, my wife used to go here years ago on a regular basis and she's told me how amazing the burgers were and so I expected an amazing burger. Boy, was I disappointed.\n\nWe started with the cheese curds. They were OK, but nothing spectacular. I ordered Green Chili Bacon Cheeseburger. I honestly think I've had a better burger at In-n-Out and maybe even McDonald's. When the waitress took our order she didn't ask either my wife or myself how we wanted it cooked and both of us forgot to mention it. I don't know if they usually don't ask, but I do sort of expect that when I order a burger. My thinking is if they don't ask, they only serve it one way, and if that is the way I received mine then I don't know how this place gets raves for their burgers. It was well done, completely overcooked, charred on the outside and not juicy at all. In my book, juicy is they key component of a great burger. The patty itself was fairly small and dwarfed by the bun. As my wife said, charge a buck more and add some ground beef. My wife's basic hamburger was the same way - charred, overcooked and dry. The bun was good, though. The fries were also very good but not good enough to make me go back just for the fries. The fries are a side show to the main event of the burger.\n\nAs for the service, it started out OK and stayed there. I ordered a Blue Paddle beer. When the server delivered it she asked if I would like an orange to go with it. I said yes but it never showed up. Our water was refilled as needed, which was nice although expected. We did have to wait a while for our check because our server was out on the patio smoking (I know because I watched her). I understand everyone needs a break but IMHO she was out there too long.\n\nI wanted the experience, particularly the food, to be better and according to my wife it used to be fantastic. Either we had a really off night or it's just gone downhill since she's been there. Maybe we'll try it again but as my wife said \"There are too many other choices and other places to try out there.\" I was going to rate this one star, but I'm giving it two simply because everyone else has such amazing things to say.

There is an area with pool tables and other bar games, and a raised platform like area complete with TVs and booth table seating.  Of course if you don't like the whole table thing, the bar is nice to sit at as well.  One of my favorite amenities at Monkey Pants is the board games.  While you are waiting for food, feel free to grab Monopoly or Sorry to play with friends.\n The menu at Monkey Pants puts a fun spin on the typical bar menu.  While the usual suspects of wings, potato skins and other bar appetizers all grace the front page, the names of the burgers stand out as the focal point of the menu.  Each burger is named after a state, and is garnished with foods from the region.  And if that weren't enough, bacon can be added to anything for a buck.  I started with an order of wings and a side of onion rings.  The burger I ordered was the Nebraska Burger, which to a picky eater is perfect; it's the only plain burger.  I also added bacon...hey, it's only a dollar.\n The appetizers where good and came out quickly.  The wings sauce had a nice flavor and heat, and if I were to guess, did not come out of a can as is.  This is definitely a house recipe.  The onion rings weren't too bad either, but after eating both (with a friend, I'm not that big of a gluten), I did feel like the burger might be a little too much...but I, in the name of writing a review, forged through the fullness.  The burger was cooked just as I asked, and was perfect in size.  The fries, which can kill a meal quickly, were crispy and flavorful.  As I started the main course, I knew that there was no way, that the food in front of me would not survive my stay at the restaurant.\n Service was great.  The sarcastic wit of my waitress made me feel like I was a regular, and quite welcomed any time I liked.  The food, place and service were a complete package of what I am looking for in bar food.  The specialty days that they offer, i.e.: Wig Wednesday, wear a wig get happy hour prices, make me want to frequent the place over and over again.  I would recommend Monkey Pants for anyone in the mood for a good environment, nice food and fun service.  And if you can stay for the One O'clock Shirtless Shot, I would recommend it.

I definitely nod in the direction of the New Mexico, the Arizona and the Georgia burgers. They are all amazing, and if you're feeling silly, go for the Alaskan burger...that's sure to make your server (or Chris the bartender) chuckle. Next up, The Pants' ranch.

He looked like a grubby Wolverine and was out to smoke/ talk on his phone once he figured out which magic button he could mash to play almost the correct song. I was there for 2 hours....\nAmbiance: always known as a little bit icky dive bar (fine by me) this place has gotten worse! Bathrooms were filthy and there were dirty poo filled fish tanks next to the bar. On the counters were lovely flip flyers of things that go on every night including...\"Wigger Wednesday\" where you wear a wig. Not cute for business. You want my money? This is the b.s. you expect at a houseparty....where you would find more likeable characters and spend less money. \nThis time it had been 2 years since I came. Bought a round of drinks for my friends and watched as the \"bartender\" poured the equivalent of 1 1/2 shots of liquor total for 4 tall drinks. She then added Sprite to the shaker and mounded the pint glasses heaping with ice. Even then it couldn't be watered down enough so guess what? MORE SPRITE.\nI asked for an extra shot of vodka in each when she brought them to me. She then charged me $5 each drink for a 2 count (at best) which is half a pour for non bar people. So all in all I paid a fortune for 4 very weak tall drinks for my friends. I didn't have a fit because 3 of my friends were locals and I didn't want to make a fuss in case they went back. I left her $1.01 tip....and you know what that $.01 means when you works for tips. If she would have given me a full shot as a back I would have tipped her $7-8 for the drinks. \nTo top off the evening was \"shirtless shots\" where the woman bartender (see glasses of Sprite above) takes off her shirt (leaves bra on, thankfully) and pours premade 1/2 Chambord 1/2 Soda Water shots from pitchers as only shirtless dudes line up to the bar. I didn't see the whole bar, but 3 of the guys I went with went up for fun. One did not get a shot at all, which is ridiculous since our group had been taking turns buying entire rounds of drinks 4-5 at a time. It is a gimmick, but when in Rome, I get it. It was just such a let down of things that could have been made better with a better staff attitude and training, a little more consciousness and consistency.\n\n Skip it.

I didn't know I was some sort of super being until I went to Monkey Pants. But right then and there, one faithful night my powers manifested and with a snap of your fingers I was invisible. Suddenly none of the bartenders at this place could see me.  No matter where I stood or how hard I smiled, tried to look friendly and make eye contact all of them stared right past me like I wasn't even there.  I didn't want to startle anyone so I didn't cry out, whistle or yell at any of the staff and seeing as how I was now invisible I was afraid that if I waved my arms or beckoned I might poke out the eye of an innocent bystander (with great power comes great responsibility don't you know). Besides I wouldn't do any of those things if I were a regular Joe customer visible for all to see; I use a thing called \"bar etiquette\" and disdain folks that are rude and do those sorts of things to any hard working bar staff.

When I stood too close to one of the regulars I was visible too and was eventually served.\n\nI went back to the table on the smoking patio that my lovely companions and I had claimed and excitedly explained to my well dressed and attractive female companions of my new found powers (and their limitations) and was dumb struck to find out that they too had manifested the powers of invisibility as none of the wait staff could see them either. And sure enough no less than three waitresses passed by in less than ten minutes, our table void of drinks and none of them could see our pleading features.  In fact as the night dragged along the waitress seemed more interested in getting to their shifty drinks after work and even placing regulars at our table failed to garnish us any attention.  As last called neared there were so many people wearing monkey pants attire on the smoking patio it was hard to tell who was working and who was working on a buzz. Not that it mattered because we were still invisible you see. \n\nThrough-out the evening after sitting drink-less for dozens of minutes on end, my invisible friends and I had to stoop to standing next to regulars at the bar to be seen just to get a drink. There were a number of these patrons that I wished my superpowers worked on; especially the girl that decided to point out my jeans were riding a little too low by putting her finger in my ass crack. During one of my extremely long and patient waits at the bar I ended up getting tired (a side effect of being invisible perhaps?) and leaned on one of the stickiest bars I've ever come across. People were eating food here too which amazed me because there didn't seem to be soap or a way to dry your hands in the restrooms and I could only imagine how dirty those fingers were that they were licking nacho grease off of. \n\nOur night ended without incident and we left, unseen by the staff of course. \n\nAn interesting post script is that apparently the burned out neon sign that adorns this place was the source of our collective super powers because we're not invisible to bar and wait staff anywhere else but Monkey Pants.

I have a rule when it comes to food establishments and this place does follow suite. Most often than not the little mom and pop shop hole in the wall. .

And I will have to break it down into categories. \n\n---------Environment:****\nHere's the deal. If you enjoy tennis, chess, and polo. This \"aint\" your spot. If you are comfortable with wobbly tables, hard chairs the sound of beer bottles tossed into a trash can .  .then keep reading.  \nHarvey's Wineburger reminds me of Stag's Head bar. In case you don't remember that's the name of the place on Dukes of Hazard? Ok well the waitress was no where near the same looks as daisy but she had a mom and pop shop charm about her. Smiles and jokes were readily available. Chris T. and I were rather excited about possibly finding a new \"joint\" to hang out at and writing a good review. I ordered the Cheese Wineburger and Chris ordered the Super Cheese Wineburger. She mentioned something about the fries and onion rings because we would get more for cheaper or something. I didn't really hear but Chris said sure and that was good enough for me.  \n\n---------The Wait: ---------**\n\nAs we walked in the door it we found a dark bar with a grill on the left. We sat our selves hoping someone would notice. There were a couple people in there that looked like regulars chatting away about something to the line cook and I think that is what our down fall was. The food was late and the waitress right off the bat apologized as she gave us our to-go bag as we requested after franticly watching the clock. She tossed in the drinks and fries for free because of the wait.  There was a long wait for the order. I believe it was the cool jibber-jabbin to the regulars that hung up the order. \n\n---------The Food: --------- *****\n\nIf it came only to the food I would give this review 5 stars. The burgers were stacked high like it was going for a photo-op.  I like my fries a little crispy and thought they were perfect. I'm not into soggy fries. \n\nI have to make a comment on the other reviews. These are the ones about the lack of hygiene comments. This is referring to one night that they were extremely understaffed on a Friday night. I have to ask you if you ever worked in a restaurant.  I hate to tell you but that is more common than you think. Even when I worked in a 4 star restaurant at a resort. Ever watch Hells Kitchen.  .yeah. . Stick your finger in my food and see if the meat is done. . Thanks. .\n\nI have to say I have not made a final thumb up or down. Next time I go there for lunch \"and I plan on going back\" I will call ahead and order. My only issue with this place was the wait for the food. The staff was friendly in a down home manner.  The food was really good, and my only issue was the wait. \n\n---------Over all score: --------- ****\n look for another review at some point. I'm not firm on this.

First off, I like Harvey's.  Do I go to Harvey's all the time?  Nope.  But I enjoy the burgers and the simplicity of the place.  I have probably been there 15 times over the past 3 years, so this is a culmination of all of those meals.\n\nEveryone talks about the decor (or lack thereof).  The inside of the place is DARK (especially when compared to most places in Phoenix).  When you leave the place during the day, make sure you have sunglasses.  After your eyes spend so much time adjusting to the lack of lighting, the sun feels like inmates coming out of solitary confinement for a month.  While the decor gets 0 stars from the Zagat type crowd, I find some sort of enjoyment with how beat down it is.  In fact, if they spruced it up, I probably wouldn't like it as much.  It is a true dive bar.\n\nThe service isn't great, but it isn't what I would call bad.  It isn't like they screw everything up, but it is a bit slow.  If you are in a hurry to eat (like most Americans on lunch hour), then maybe you should go to McDonald's across the street.\n\nFinally, the burgers.  They are great.  Quality meat, good cheese, and plenty of char.  I never found the food unsanitary, but I have also been to Brazil, so the food here is always more sanitary.  I am not a fan of the fries (got to Delux, Gordon Biersch, or Cafe Bink if you want truly great fries), but the onion rings are good (not as good as Ted's Hot Dogs, though).  I love the fact that they have RC Cola.  I have only had drinks there 1 time.  They make them stiff, and will impair your judgement quickly if you aren't careful.  They have a heavier hand in pouring than most college bars.\n\nOverall, I recommend it if you like dingy bars and a good burger.  Sure, there are better burgers in town, but this is pretty unique.

I still had work to get done that afternoon, so I had to stick with an RC Cola (yes, you read that correctly.....RC Cola). Let me just tell you that I was the only person in the place that didn't have a beer in hand. Happy hour (and the weekend, apparently) had arrived early at Harvey's. \n\nJust a quick moment on the very eclectic crowd that filled this place. On my left were two appliance repairmen. On my right was a gentlemen that was pushing 80. At the pool tables were a group of what looked like college kids. Their common bond was the beer they were all putting away. I immediately made plans to return on a coming Friday afternoon, with friends in tow, and be a part of this very diverse, day drinking crowd. \n\nNow, onto the food, which is why I stopped by in the first place. I wasn't sure what a \"wineburger\" is and I can't fully say that, even now, I understand. All I know is that I ordered their standard wineburger and that it was grilled fresh for me, right at the bar. \n\nThe burger took about 15 minutes to cook and I could pretty much watch them prepare it. The same person that took my order (and delivered beers to all my fellow patrons) prepped and cooked the burger. It was fresh ground meet, pressed into a patty and they regularly pressed it into the grill with her spatula. Ultimately, it was served up on a fresh bun, which crisp lettuce, onions pickles, and melting cheese. \n\nLet me tell you that this burger was FRESH. Grease was still dripping off the sides of it. There were cracks in the edge of the burger, where they had been pressing it down into the grill. I actually had to wait a couple of minutes to eat it, as it was still TOO hot. I'm not sure of where you're going to go and get a burger that is cooked that fresh, right in front of you, and then immediately handed to you. Probably one of the freshest hamburgers that I've ever had prepared (in which I wasn't actually grilling it myself). \n\nThe onion rings were straight out of the boiling oil and too hot to eat.

There were probably 4 people at the bar, and 3 people in the game room playing pool.  They had the classic MLB game on, it was like Blue Jays and Astros, funny uniforms! It was maybe 2pm.  So the bartender says, What can I get for you?  My dumbazz says \"Can I see a menu\", this is where the music would have stopped.  WHOOPSY, there really isn't a menu, its kind of like a snack bar, where you look up, make your choice and its done.  Burger or Dog, Fries, Onion Rings or both!! DUH!  The bartender was nice though, I wanted draft the BF wanted bottle so he suggested I get a small pitcher, it's the cheapest way to go...SOLD! Don't have to pull my leg, thats for sure!  \n\nSo, I ordered the cheeseburger, and the BF orders the gigantic chili burger, which was reduced to the smaller one by recommendation of the friendly bartender. BF sort of put up a fight, but the bartender assured him it would be plenty and if not, the next one was on him.  This turned out to be plenty for him, and I was thankful too, we had a long night ahead of us.  Much to our surprise, although I'm not sure what else we were thinking, bartender grabs a handful of meat slaps it on the flat top smooshes it down, and thus our burgers were born and cooking.  I mean, for real?  Man it was soo good, greasy yes, but everything a burger should be!  The last bite of course was the best, it had me looking for my other half, since I always cut those suckers in half.  I don't eat burgers often, but I can't wait to take my dad here, I might have finally found one place in town he's never been too.\n\nWhile we were finishing up, a couple came in and sat next to us, who appeared to have just finished a golf game.

We also had the Sausage Rolls which we proceeded to drench with HP Sauce and devour. B.O. also has a great Bread Pudding!\n\nThe atmosphere is great, but I did notice one small problem. The place isn't very handicap accessible. There was a woman who came in while we were there who had just had hip-replacement surgery. There was no place she could sit at which she did not have to climb a step and it was obviously very difficult for her. After witnessing this I looked around and realized that there were no tables that would be accessible to someone in a wheelchair.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "First impressions aren't everything. So, I feel entirely justified re-Yelping the British Open after having been here three times. Sometimes you need repeat outings to really get the full \"feel\" of a place, right? \n\nMY FIRST TIME:\nThe crowd was mixed. You could easily find yourself face-to-face with \"creepy old guy\" when you first walk in. At least I did. But, he's not \"stalker creepy guy\" so it's okay. I can deal with that. Apparently it's okay to have a baby in the bar, too. Startin' 'em young, I tell ya. \n\nOn the jukebox: The Black Keys, Wilco, Freeze Pop, Sarah McLachlan.\n\nThe beer menu offered selections from various countries. Nothing on tap appealed to me, so I went with the Sam Smith's Nut Brown. Very good. I had never had it before. That is probably my beer of choice at the British Open. I'd like to try the Oatmeal Stout, too. \n\nI don't think I'd go out of my way to frequent the B.O. Pub. It's in an obscure and generic retail plaza. That doesn't bother me so much as the \"mediocre\" vibe I got while sitting at the table. I guess the British Open and myself just didn't \"click.\" That's okay. Not every bar and myself can have that special kind of chemistry. It's an organic thing, I tell ya. It's Pub Kismet. \n\n* * *\n\nSECOND HELPINGS:\n(summary)\n\nI sat at the bar this time. The service was faster. I perused the menu with my date and our friend. My date and I sampled a couple beers. I had the Whitbread Ale. It was okay. But... alas... COULD IT BE? Yes. It was Love At First Sip when I tried the Heather Ale from Scotland. This ale is aromatic and is made with lavender. Uhm, could you want anything else? I savored every sip and made the declaration that I love this pub for this ale alone -- and that I don't know if I can get this anywhere else. \n\nWhile at the bar, we got \"troubled\" to sign a petition to make St. Pat's Day a national holiday. For handing over our hancocks, we got free pins and pens. Nice. \n\n***\n\nST. PATRICK'S DAY:\n(a short story of celebration)\n\nAs luck would have (luck of the Irish?), my friend and I touched on the British, Scottish and Irish in an hour's time - not to mention grabbed the last table when we walked in shortly after 5 p.m. \n\nWe came to the BritOpen, for I wanted my friend to try the Heather Ale, and I selfishly wanted to be part of a celebration at what could pass as a St. Patrick's Day-friendly establishment. So, we sat among other St. Pat's fans, while we drank one of the best ales either of us has ever had. We got asked if we wanted to order a Killian's, since they were $2 and you'd get a free shot glass with your order. Plus a bag of malts to try. Interesting. After the Heather Ale, my friend ordered a Killian's at the bar, where they weren't handing out the freebies. Bummer. We did manage to track down a couple free shot glass - for what it's worth. \n\nWe were about to leave when the Irish music stopped. We turned and saw a \"band\" of bagpipers and drummers and the like start playing outside the pub, framed in the open doorway. Then they walked through the crowd to stand near the jukebox/TV screen to play some songs. It was incredible! My friend said, \"I feel like my homeland is calling.\" She is, after all, a beautiful Scottish lass. \n\nAfter their rendition of \"Amazing Grace,\" we made our subtle exit. That's when I knew I had to re-Yelp this place. After all, bagpipes? Heather Ale? Good prices? Close to work and where I live?\n\nYeah, I will definitely be hanging out here again...and again... and again!\n\n***\nBEWARE: Their Sampler Plate is NASTY, with just a pinch of \"meh.\" The pickles who WHOLE, not cut into chips, like the menu implies.

Sure it might be fun and adventurous at times, but too much adventure will probably leave you dead.  In a world of extra greasy food, good bar food usually falls under that category, when it really doesn't have to.  Grease is not a condiment, it never has been.  The more grease, the more you will feel is the next morning, while also nursing a wicked hang over.  In my never ending search and self destructive search for good bar food, I have stumbled upon the British Open in Scottsdale, Arizona.  \n\nThe bar itself is a mix of old English Pub, and golfer paradise.  Being that is called the British Open, one of the four golf major championships, I found that it completely fit the bill.  There is a nice size bar, that one can belly up to for a libation or meal, as well as a seating area that is a mix of half booths, and elevated bar tables.  The pool table that is basically in the center is more a waste of space than a commodity to drunken patrons.\n\nTo get in the spirit, I choose my next words carefully...Me mate and I found seats at the bar, while our bartender attentively welcomed up.  She asked if we wanted to drink, but being that I wanted to review the food, and not how much I can consume on a Saturday afternoon, I stuck to a Coke.  Actually I asked for a Dr. Pepper, but not too many bars carry that on the bar guns.\n\nThe menu is your typical bar food, with a mix of British delicacies (a term I use lightly.)  Wings, burgers, onion rings jumped out at me as I looked over the menu.  Being that I haven't had a good burger in a while, my choice was clear.  Started with an order of hot wings, and then the burger: Medium rare, with bacon...no cheese. \n\nThe wings came out first.  The sauce was very basic and could even be called a little watery.  However, the flavor was not too hot, and had the right amount of pepper.  The wings were deep fried too, with no breading or batter.  We ate them with some joy, as we talked and watched football on one of the many TVs throughout.\n\nThe burgers came out soon after, with little wait.  Size wise the plate was just what you needed if you were going to have a beer with your meal.  No so big that you don't want to drink afterwards, but big enough to fill you up.  Cooked to a perfect medium rare, I enjoyed the burger enormously.    The side of fries was also cooked to a perfect golden brown.  And as the bartender kept our drinks full, and checked on us just enough, I can say that I was having a pleasant eating experience.\n\nI do see myself going back to the British Open.  The food was great, with the exception of the wings (it could be a west coast thing) and the food was reasonably priced.  Also, I saw that they have karaoke on Wednesday, and I do like to sing.

Before you order, be aware there are many choices: First, if you're ordering a burger, they come in various sized--small one, big one (1/3#), double big one (2 of the previous patties), great big one (1/2#) and super great one (+1#). Then there's the buns, either onion, whole wheat or white. Then, there's the cheeses: Swiss, cheddar, jalapeno jack, American, provolone). If you're too intimidated to build your own burger, there are about half a dozen specialty burgers from which to chose. We ended up getting the Big One special, which came with fries for $5.49 but does not include your drink. Don't worry, though.

Go to hamburger works.  Unlike a lot of hamburger places in town this place cooks your burger on a real BBQ like the one in your backyard.  Well sort of :) their BBQ is a lot bigger!  \n\nOrdering is kind of weird you order at the station next to the grill then walk around the corner to pay and then they call out your number.  I think they do this so that you can walk around and see the burgers grilling and the kitchen.  \n\nOn the other side of the place there is a full bar.  They also have an outside eating area and back entrance.  \n\nThe food is awesome.  I have been here pretty regular since I discovered it on yelp.  The buns have always been fresh and the burgers are grilled so they are not as juicy and greasy.  But thats a good thing.  They have an awesome flavor! The condiment bar is pretty cool.  You get the standard fair.  This is pretty much a build your own burger place.  I like to take my burger and put lettuce tomato onions and thousand island.  Its like an in and out on steroids! \n\nThe fried fair is good. Im not a fan of their french fries I usually go for the half mushroom/zucchini combo.  But if you get a combo with fries I recommend getting a ranch cup from the condiment bar and dipping them in that.  Their ranch is so good!   \n\nThe Chicken sandwich is also good.  Get the plain unless you want to be covered in sauce. \n\nOverall I love this place this is a great family restaurant and you wont break the bank.

Pouring a pitcher of beer from the tap, then setting an ice-cold glass in front of me, she offered up a menu.\n\nWhile the 30-year-old eatery in Phoenix is showing its age, the attitude is laid back and super friendly.\n\nThe Original Hamburger Works has two dining rooms, the bar and a more family-friendly space. The taste is decidedly kitschy, with walls covered in vintage signs, sporting memorabilia and chotchkies galore. The atmosphere is fun. Large tables can accommodate big groups. Orders are placed and paid for at the counter. In the bar, orders are taken by the bartender.\n\nLike a campfire, there is something mouthwatering about the strong smell of mesquite wood smoke emanating from the kitchen. You can tell from watching the cooks manhandle slabs of meat over an open flame that the burgers here are treated right.\n\nThe centerpiece of the dining room is a wagon filled with fresh-sliced tomatoes, lettuce, onions and pickles and condiments and salad dressings. You are in control of your burger destiny with as many ladles of ranch dressing as you'd like. I'd recommend not going too heavy on the condiments and toppings; the burgers here can stand on their own.\n\nBiting into the Big One ($4.09) gives new meaning to the whimsical saying. A deep amber charbroiled crust surrounds the 1/3 pound of fresh ground beef, inside it's perfectly medium, as ordered. The meat is toothsome, well seasoned and bursting with a wonderful beefy caramelized flavor.\n\nPotatoes, aka fries ($1.79), were disappointingly pale and seemingly unsalted. I'd opt for the Onion Rings ($2.69), fried golden brown and addictive with dunks into ranch dressing.\n\nIf you don't eat red meat you're in luck, they make a juicy Chicken Sandwich ($5.09). Cooked over the same mesquite coals, this sandwich has a surprising amount of satisfying heft. The Italian version gets a treatment of flavor, adding Italian dressing before getting cooked to a savory finish.\n\nFair warning: When eating Buffalo Wings (nine pieces for $5.95) don't wear a nice shirt.

Oh I know, you don't like people who expect you to do your job, like wipe off the food debris left on the table and booths.  Maybe wait on customers with a friendly attitude and not argue about the fact that I must be drinking a different kind of club soda.  Really?  How about considering that perhaps the club soda you are pouring is tap water or at the very least admit that it's horribly flat.\n\nStupid stuff to even give my time to really but unfortunately I have had enough of these experiences over the years and decided today was the last cocktail straw.\n\nIt's a shitty bar that stinks, with a lousy and entitled wait staff, none of whom really know how to make a decent drink and if they do know they don't want you to know!\n\nI vowed tonight in the presences of my friends that I will never be going back here again.

That happened.\n\nThe decor is retro and super cute. Lots of old school signs which I snagged a few photos of. (Just not the food!) The outdoor patio seems pretty nice but my review is only of the indoor bar area. We wanted to watch some of the sporting events going on.\n\nI tried something on the adventurous side called a \"Hawaiian Burger\". This is a slice of pineapple with teriyaki and provolone cheese. Such an interesting mix of flavors! I'm definitely a fan! \n\nAnd then (oh boy!) I wedged in slices of jalape\u00f1os, tomatoes, lettuce (ok, that's not cutting edge) and a smattering of mayo. This totally worked for me. I love jalape\u00f1os. (I can't possibly imagine having a 1/2 lb burger. 1/3lb burger seemed more than enough!)\n\nI was tickled pink that there's a little condiment wagon you can help yourself to. Even tho it was evening everything on the wagon was super fresh. (No wilted lettuce for me!) Also, it's worth noting the fries are crunchy and not at all on the soggy side. (I snagged one from my fella. Delish!) \n\nEvening crowd seemed to consist of local area folks. I'm told clientele during the day is more of office and hospital employees. This place is super kid friendly. The kids really seemed to get a kick out of the soda machine. (Where you press a button and different soda streams out.)\n\nWe were checked on a number of times by employees, even though we were not sitting anywhere near the bar.

Good, but not special. \n\nThe server never came back to take another drink order.
