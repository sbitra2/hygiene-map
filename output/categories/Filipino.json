It isn't as good as my mama's cooking, but if I can't have that, then this will be a good substitution.  The restaurant seating area is small as in not many seats.  When I walked in, the smell reminded me of home =).  I was greeted by the waiter and he is Filipino, so I knew would be very helpful.  There is a section of the menu that is dedicated to 2 people as it is a set menu:  a seafood set menu and a meat set menu.  With some items on the menu you also have the option to try kamayan, which is eating with your hands.  Most of the couples in there (seems to be a popular place for romantic dates) went straight for utensils, but there was one couple that wanted to try it.  The waiter explained the technique (yes... there is a technique) and he did a good job.\n\nI started with the Lumpia Shanghai, pork eggrolls with a spicy sweet and sour dipping sauce.  Those were delicious, just like home.  I noticed my favourite dish on the menu, Sinigang na baboy, a tamarind based soup (sometimes called sour soup) with veggies and pork.  There is a small and a large size.  While the waiter said that the small size was like a starter and the large size was enough for two, I opted for the small size with a bowl of steamed rice.  He came out with a little box with holes at the top and candles inside, placed it on the table and placed a plate on it.  Now everyone was looking at me because I was the only one not ordering from the set menu.\n\nHe then came back with a bowl of rice and a bowl of sinigang.  He moved the plate onto the table and then placed the bowls of food on the box.  Clever idea!  When he said that the small portion was like a starter, he must've meant a starter for two because it was more than enough for me.  The rice was perfectly done (yes, I'm a snob about my rice).  And the sinigang was really good... only complaint was that some of the pork was a bit tough.  There were green beans, tomatoes, onions, and napa cabbage.  The broth was a little spicy, which was nice.  I did ask the waiter for patis, a fish sauce, to add a bit of salt to the broth.  They came through!\n\nI also decided to have dessert, usually I opt for Halo Halo or Ube, but because I don't see it on menus often, I went for the Bibinka.  The Bibinka wasn't quite what I am familiar with, but it was still warm and tasty.  And... all of that (I had water to drink) was under \u00a311.00.  I highly recommend this place (I walked 1.5 miles from my hotel to get there)... while it is authentic, it also provides a lot of dishes and even tutorials to help introduce people to Filipino food.

Instead, he tucked into barbeque pork, which surprised him by the lack of sauce while I pushed out my sensory boat by opting for bitter melon and prawns. Note to self: now you've tried bitter melon, you never ever ever ever have to eat that again - never has a vegetable (or fruit) been more aptly named. Sadly after trying it, it seemed to mask the flavour of the rest of the dish, so I didn't particularly enjoy my meal, although the bamboo rice that we shared was tasty. For dessert, the boy tried out the jackfruit and banana pancake while I tucked into a surprisingly fruity leche flan.

I had missed my mom's cooking and felt a little home sick so we decided heading to a Filipino restaurant would satisfy my craving.  I invited two friends who had never had Filipino food but were interested and eager to see what all the fuss (me complaining how much I missed pancit, pan de sal, and adobo) was all about.  It was amazing. I was in heaven. It was like my own mother was cooking for me. \n\nI went again about a month ago for my friend's birthday.  Her boyfriend had never tried Filipino food but was very keen.  Again we were very pleased with the food. If you are with group of at least four then I suggest you opt for the 'Kamayan' style dining option.  It's customary in the Philippines to eat with your hands so they provide each diner with a little bowl with warm water and lemon juice to rinse your hands between courses.  Alternatively, you can ask for cutlery (but there's not fun in that!). \n\nThe starter we received was a mix of pork and chicken skewers and lumpia (which are like mini spring rolls filled with pork and veges). The next course was a chicken and ginger soup. Note that the chicken still had bones in it.  We had a variety of the mains.  My friend's boyfriend really enjoyed the lechon (roasted pork).  For dessert, we decided to try all four (aside from the ice cream and halo halo). The bibingka which is made from cassava root was very tasty as well as the leche flan (caramel/condensed milk) and the turon (friend banana). Note we asked to switch some of the items on the set menu with some on the a la carte menu and they happily obliged. \n\nThe best part of the meal was the service. I think it's part of the Filipino mentality but we were definitely impressed (both times!).

I had the combo with my fav, dinuguan (aka dinardaraan for my Ilocano bothers), and Thelma's special. \n\n Dinuguan is a vinegary tasting pork blood meat.  Being cooked with blood, it comes out looking like stew size chunks of pork in black sauce.   It is rich with flavor and has a lovely grit to it from the blood.  Thema's take on it was true to mom's cooking back home.  However, the sauce was a bit thinner than I like and they seem to have taken out all the fatty bits for the general public's sake.  My mom didn't discriminate, fatty or lean, it went in the pot.  Over all, it was great.  Not as good as moms, but pretty close.\n\nNow Thelma's special is a bit miss leading.  The description says it's lichon kawali cut up and mixed with chopped onions, tomatoes, and soy sauce.  A more accurate description would have been chicharon with chopped onions, tomatoes, and bagoong.  Cause that's what it tasted like and it tasted wonderful.  It made me wish that I got more of it.  For those of you that don't know, lichon Kawali is a whole roasted pig, all crispy and wonderful on the outside.  This dish was salty, oniony, sweet, meaty, and crunchy.  Heavenly.

The walls of the interior are painted a light green color that I enjoyed. There are gold statuettes along the walls, as well as many large windows that fill the space with natural light. On most, if not all, of the tables are little vases with orchids. It was a pleasant dining area even with the TV playing in the background. It can be hard to spot if you don't pull into the parking area behind Aloha kitchen. \n\nThe menu is displayed on the wall along with several photos of their specialties. J quickly decided on the lechon kawali, a large portion of crispy skinned pork with juicy, fatty meat on the inside. It came with a vinegary dipping sauce that complimented the richness of the meat and several slices of raw sweet onion. It was REALLY crisp, crackled when you bite into kind of crisp. I found it made my jaw muscles tired after eating 3-4 pieces- but probably not a bad thing since all that chewing might help work off some of that delicious pork fat. I ordered the adobo, which was a large bowl full of super tender, soy and vinegar-spiced pork chunks. The cuts of pork reminded me of some of the better carnitas I've had, with enough gristle and unrendered fat left to give it an unctuous mouth feel. The flavorful sauce was great to pour over the perfectly cooked sticky rice and more of it would've disappeared easily. It seemed like a dish that had been cooking low and slow for quite some time, a signature of many comforting dishes. I would have liked some vegetables with it to break up all the meatiness, but it was a delicious dish. The texture of the rice was great with the pork. We also got an order of the Shanghai lumpia, which would have all vanished if I hadn't caught J before he got to them all! Crisp, narrow cigar-shaped little pockets of deep-fried meaty goodness served with a sweet and sour chili sauce, it's easy to see why. \n\nWe also had an Ilikoi passion drink and Kona coffee. The coffee was lovely but was served with packets of non-dairy creamer, which saddens me a little. It's really a small detail, but when having such a nice variety of coffee I want to enjoy it fully and without high fructose/hydrogenated processed things. Not a huge deal because it still tasted great, but something I find worth pointing out. I was really excited that they offered kona coffee! The passion fruit drink was also tasty, though J drank most of it. The water tasted like tap water, so we barely sipped any.\n\nOverall, the food here was great. If you're a fan of the Hawaiian Sun drinks I imagine you'll be happy. It's a nice change of pace from the usual strip mall fare and I'd rather go here than to another McChipotle or Pei Wei.

It's basically Lechon kawali soaked in soy sauce, onions, and tomatoes.  Mines was a little on the \"oniony\" side, but it was definitely delicious.

Location is right across the street from the mall itself and nearby Sunset Station casino. I missed my friend's Father cooking homemade Chicken Adobo and Pork Gisantes.. oh the aroma that filled the room as he cooked these dishes. I woke up to this every time I slept over at her place. One of many reasons why I loved spending a night there :P So sometimes I have cravings for something sour, sweet, and tangy all in one visit. This place is just what I needed. \n\nI loved the dining area... so spacious and clean. The light green colored walls and wooden chairs gave this place such an cool, soft ambiance... I couldn't help but think I was in Hawaii or somewhere tropical. I enjoyed sitting by the window and having the sun rest on my face. Nice to look out and enjoy a beautiful day!!! \nI ordered a mixed plate of the choice of two.... I chose the one scoop of rice and mac salad with two entrees of the Pork Gisantes and Chicken Adobo. When the plate arrived, it had a wonderful fragrant, color, and looked so tasty!!! It was one huge chicken piece for the Chicken Adobo and the meat was so tender that you wouldn't even need a knife to cut it. All I had to do was peel the meat off with my fork. Juicy and a burst of flavor... it had a small acidic bite, but the sauce was so delicious with rice. The Pork Gisantes had chunks of meat, green peas and green bell peppers. The meat had a few chunks of fat too, but it contributes to the flavor of the dish, so I didn't mind at all. The sauces from both dishes were wonderful to taste...  It was a combination of sweetness and sour. I asked for the condiments and added some vinegar/garlic sauce to the Pork Gisantes, because I like to go a little extreme on the sour side. Maybe too much..  where you coat your whole tongue full of vinegar!!! I love it! \n\nAfter I finished everything... I always loved the Filipino dessert... Halo Halo! So I ordered their Halo Halo Special that came with Macapuno Ube(Young Coconut Purple Yam) ice cream! YUM. They serve it to you in a glass bowl with two scoops of ice cream and a piece of leche flan on top of crushed ice. Underneath the ice is where all the goodies are placed. Sugar palm fruit, jackfruit, nata de coco (chewy, jelly-like), and sweet beans are all mixed together to enjoy. It's topped off with some toasted crushed young rice and it's a wonderful treat to have after a tangy, hearty meal. And also you can sip it like a drink when you ate everything and all the ice has melted. So delicious and revitalizing to the senses!!! \n\nService was very friendly and helpful. Although I don't eat much Filipino cuisine, I do love it every time I come here. Brings back good old memories and flavors I missed during my childhood.

I went with a four-item combo consisting of Mongo, Pinapaitan, Thelma's Special, and Pork Adobo. Of course, I added a small bowl of Sinigang for $1.\n\nThe Mongo intrigued me because it's Ilocano style, which I've never tried before. It's less soupy than the Mongo I'm used to. In addition, it's white as opposed to green. But more importantly, it was delicious.\n\nPinapaitan isn't something that would normally interest me. I don't like bitter dishes and the name screams bitter. Thankfully, the lady told me their version is more mainstream. And I do love tripe. The end result is very good, but I can still taste the bitterness obviously.\n\nThelma's Special is basically lechon with onions and tomatoes. It's pretty hard to screw this up and they certainly don't. Delicious.\n\nAs for the Adobo, this was the one thing I ordered that is probably the most ordinary.

I like supporting Filipinos that I think are from Hawaii.

I like supporting businesses that treat their patrons with respect and are appreciative that we're spending our money in their establishment. \n\nMy only suggestion: the banana lumpia ice cream mix thing is yummy...just wish they put in 2 lumpias not one. I had to share this with my brother and was about to deck him for the whole thing (j/k). It was one scoop of ube ice cream with the banana lumpia sliced up and mixed together.

Eggrolls are one of the foods the general public is introduced to when trying Filipino cuisine.   I come here for Diniguan too!  The pork is tender and very tasty. I can taste the garlic which I think brings out this dish. Some people are bit put off when you tell them the English translation \"Pork Blood Stew\" and the meat is cooked in the blood juices with garlic and vinegar. It's similar to the blood sausage or British Black pudding. So other than the process or the name of the dish, dont let that stop you from trying it out.

The families I have been around have always been so welcoming, and the food has always been phenomenal. Needless to say, I was expecting this same type of experience at Thelma's. \n\nMy family and I ate lunch there a few days ago, and were a little shocked at the lack of customer service we received.  I get it; this place is not your typical set up. You need to order your food at the counter and then seat yourself.  Someone will then drop your food off at your table and will never check on you again. However, I noticed that other customers inside the restaurant were receiving more attention than we were. I only know some cuss words in Tagalog, so I couldn't follow the conversations. Don't get me wrong, they staff didn't mistreat us, nor were they rude in any way. We were basically ignored. For example, after our meal I went up to order the Coco-nana dessert. When the lady brought us our dessert, she didn't even grab our dirty dishes off of the table as she was heading back to the kitchen. I pre-tipped her when I paid for my bill, and felt that was the least she could have done. It's not like they were garbage cans around so I could clear my own table. I was less than satisfied from a customer service standpoint, but the food was good.\n\nFor an appetizer, we decided on the Shanghai lumpia. These were close to perfect, and were accompanied by a sweet chili dipping sauce. My only complaint was that there were only 6 in the order. I could eat 2 dozen of these by myself-they are so addicting. For our entree, we decided on the chicken adobo. Good--but I have had better. Specifically, the adobo lacked seasoning and came across as a little bland. The pancit was delicious! However, my favorite part of this meal was the previously mentioned coco-nana dessert. Warm banana bread with a scoop of coconut ice cream over the top was the perfect end to our meal.  I didn't even care that I am lactose intolerant. \n\nI really like this place and am thankful that there is authentic Filipino food in Henderson.

This is it.  There was a tray heaping full of the stuff in all its golden and shiny glory.  I pointed and said that I HAD to have it.\nThe first piece I tasted was the equivalent of finding $200 in an old wallet when your rent is due.  Crunchy skin that immediately melted in my mouth.  Juicy sinful fatty stuff that clung to the thick pieces of skin.  And tender meat so juicy that it made me google how this stuff was made.  Lechon is all its hyped up to be.\n\nThe other reason for the star is for the hospitality I receive whenever I go in there.  Well, I've only been twice, but each time has been great.  Once again, the family atmosphere was in full effect.  I still haven't asked who is who, but I'll work my way up to that.  But the people behind the counter have been awesome.  This time, a dude big in stature chatted about the Knicks vs. Bulls rivalry and actually made a point that I could not deny.  Seems like a great guy and he had complete confidence in his lechon, which he full well should.  But what tops it all is the way he ended our transaction.  Let's just say it was the top of the mountain for customer/vendor relationships.  When trust is built between an owner and a customer, you pretty much have a guaranteed repeat customer.  That's what the Factory has gained in me.\n\nAlso, I got the bbq ribs again...and they were even better than last time if that's even possible.\nAnd finally, I had an order of lumpia.  Now...mines were burnt on the ends.  It wasn't ideal to have to chop the ends off of each one, but the taste of them nulls the fact that I had to do that.  These were awesome tasting lumpia.

LOL) down the street.  Had an idea to supplement the squid protein by getting some veggies from JB, but the buffet spread leaned heavily towards meat dishes with little or no veggies or (food allergy) shrimp entrees with lots of veggies.  :(  Still, $5.45 (that's already including tax!) for a two-entree combo with two 1/2 cup scoops of rice is nothing to sneeze at, so I had a plate of chicken apritada (stir-fried on-the-bone chicken with potato wedges, red bell peppers, onions, and carrots in a tomato-based sauce) and pork giniling (stir-fried ground pork with peas, green bell peppers, and onions).  As you might imagine, with the addition of red bell pepper, carrots, and peas, both entree choices were on the sweet side, which is alright, but the dish quickly bored my tastebuds due to lack of other flavor components (unlike Thai cuisine, where every bite offers a spicy, sweet, sour, and salty components to the mix!).  Even the adobo I sampled (sampling is encouraged here) was sweet.\n\n\nOne definitely should try the lunch combos, when they're the freshest, or order the noodle dishes when they're available (usually from lunch to early afternoon).

Try the one with ube ice cream (another option, at least then, was mango- Philippine mango ice cream tastes just like Philippine mango, unlike mango flavors I've tried here in the States, where they do not actually TASTE like mango, but only taste like they SMELL- totally two different sensations.)  If you've never had halo-halo before, but have tried the Vietnamese version Che bau mau, then you kind of have an idea of the Pinoy version of it.  Ours, however, has NUMEROUS variations due to additional ingredients, such as leche flan (custard), ube halaya (a pudding, of sorts, made from ground purple yam cooked with coconut milk, butter, and sugar), coconut sport strings, jackfruit, tapioca pearls (boba to you!), and, well, you get the picture.  \"Halo-halo especial\" usually means ice cream is involved.  \n\nJeepney Bistro is where I refer Filipinos and non-Filipinos to eat out of the handful of Chandler establishments the valley has to offer.

Another flavorful entree, with tender chunks of beef, and a thick tomato based sauce.\n\nOpo squash- Sliced squash marinated in a vinegar based sauce.

Taking it home, trying it, and then looking at the menu online, this dish is actually made with pork heart, which has a distinctly different texture and taste.

I also have to agree with the other yelp reviewer about the open grocery store becoming a kind of distraction when one is concentrating with his eating, perhaps a thin divider just to define the border.\n\nThree stars, and let me just say thank you Jeepney Bistro for bringing the food that I grew up eating in the Philippines here in Chandler, my new side of town.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Whenever I'm on the West Coast, I make it a point to research whatever Filipino restaurants are in the area.

Friday's menu listed a dish that wasn't offered bec. apparently it was served the day before and another dish was offered in its place.  (Why even bother printing out a menu if you're not going to stick to it?  Guess I better call ahead before making the trip from Laveen.)  One dish stood out, and I asked the server if it contained any meat, to w/c he replied just \"ginataang kalabasa\" (aka squash simmered in coconut milk).  I was starving, and aside from the \"bistek\" (pan-fried slices of beef steak) and \"pritong tilapia at galungong\" (fried tilapia and scad), nothing much interested me here.  So for my lunch combo, I chose fried tilapia and rice w/ squash, green beans, and okra simmered in coconut milk for my veggies.  \n\nI was having a good time eating my lunch until I noticed that there were shrimp (allergy) in the squash dish... The server apparently was not aware it had meat in it, could not verify if it was shrimp, and had to ask the owner/cook to confirm.  I thought this an unacceptable practice; it's a good thing for him that I am not a vegetarian, and a very good thing for the venue's cook/owner that I am not deathly allergic to shrimp, at least not yet.\n\nThe owner/cook gladly replaced the squash dish for beef steak (w/c tasted fine, albeit salty and VERY greasy), although my original buffet server was not pleased.  This irked me- what does it matter to him that she replaced a dish bec, he was negligent of the original's ingredients?  Perhaps he felt embarrassed that he couldn't even tell there was shrimp in it, but why show discontent?  Oh, he really made my blood boil!  \n\nI'll try to visit again to try other lunch specials and see if the service improves.  Otherwise, I may just spend my money at Jeepney Bistro and Lumpia Factory down the road (where my eardrums won't be tormented by untalented comics on \"Wowowee\").

Heavenly is now the third Filipino bakery to open in this same spot in the Lee Lee's shopping center. \n\nFirst impression, clean, lots of product on shelves to choose from, friendly customer service.   \n\nI was only able to quickly eye their goodies, before my little one started trying to rearrange their product display, dropping a package of \"Palitaw\" on the floor. It didn't pop open, but I bought it anyway, since the fall made it's contents all jumbled up. Good thing I have fond memories of this treat from New Years in my Mamalo's house back home. I also ordered one of their Cheese pastries. Curious if it tasted like or better than the previous owners flaky cheese pastry. \n\nI paid with my debit (couldn't do that with the previous bakery) so that's a plus. While paying, I noticed off the back left of the store behind the register, was a refrigerator stacked with ready made take home dishes, like menudo, If i recall correctly. So, next time I'll definitely take one home, but, I didn't this time, because I still had to do my grocery shopping at LeeLee's. \n\nOnce home, I tried the Palitaw. It was soft and pleasantly chewy with a non-sweet powdery coating. I think I recall coconut flakes on the ones my dad made for me back home. I'm not sure what the powdery coating is, it's got a subtle flavor of perhaps toasted crushed rice.  But, It might not be something everyone would like. If I were to compare it to something, it reminds me of mochi.  which i love.   I put these in the fridge and they didn't get hard.  \n\nI didn't treat the cheese pastry with care as I shopped around that day. When I got home to open the bag, it's top layer was almost all flaked off. So, I'll be ordering this again & eating straight from the case next time. Overall it was light and flaky and not greasy. The cheese filling was also nice, not too sweet.   My toddler loved this treat and that it wasn't overly sweet was good for her too.  I'd love it if they make another variation with some kind of fruit to contrast the cheese.  \n\nI'd like to go back without my little one, so that I can fully experience all that this 1 month new bakery has to offer & take better photos.

Definitely more welcoming than the restaurants in Chandler!  I found the high counter a little daunting- I, being only 5 feet tall, had to either hoist myself up on the counter with my elbows to peer down, or had to crouch down to have a look under the counter, and have a look through the sneeze-guard.  Their labeling system needs improvement: I vote for adhesive labels that go on the sneeze-guard so that patrons can easily identify the food on the buffet line.  I'm sorry, but no matter how often Karey and Purine say they like to cook the food to order, food laid out in huge trays and placed in \"turo-turo\" style ISN'T food cooked-to-order!\n\nHere is a list of the food I tried that day:\n\n1. Lechon, large order $6.99- includes corn tortilla (I subbed flour) and  choice of Spanish or Filipino garlic rice.  (I chose Filipino, of course!) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kareys-kitchen-phoenix?select=SHZJN-BYDlPa74nDjqH2xg#SHZJN-BYDlPa74nDjqH2xg\n\n2. 3-entree combo of Dinuguan (\"chocolate stew\"), Beef Mechado, and Pork Adobo $- includes garlic rice.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kareys-kitchen-phoenix?select=Pcxd22BrQ9Ixjgm13149fQ#Pcxd22BrQ9Ixjgm13149fQ\n\n3. Lumpia shanghai (fried Filipino pork eggrolls)- small order includes 8 pcs. of pork- and onion-filled mini-eggrolls that are fried.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kareys-kitchen-phoenix?select=HyJX4evw0Ogej34RgcptkQ#HyJX4evw0Ogej34RgcptkQ\n\n4. Halo-halo $4.50- frozen dessert consisting of sweet beans, coconut strings, coco jellies, ube (taro-based pudding), coconut milk, choice of ice cream, and shaved ice.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kareys-kitchen-phoenix?select=cphMBWm29BPKoaBidq9QCA#cphMBWm29BPKoaBidq9QCA\n\n5. Pan of cassava $8- Cassava is a root, much like a sweet potato or yam that is pounded or ground into flour and then mixed with cream, butter, eggyolks, and sugar and baked/steamed into a cake-like dessert dish.  Somewhat cakey and much thicker than an egg-custard pie... A little help here, Joel?  \n\n6.  To-go containers of Pork adobo and Dinuguan, each $3\n\nI found all the entrees and eggrolls, save the mechado (meat was a little tough), very tender and very tasty (loved the dinuguan!).  However, they're ALL very greasy, unfortunately!  I'll never ever order the fried eggrolls again... Everytime I ate them, they came back to haunt me, and all due to the high grease and salt content.  A coworker came for her first visit (with her husband and stepdaughter. as well) after I had left, and told me that she found the eggrolls VERY salty, as well as the other dishes she tried there, but couldn't bring herself to tell the owners because they were all so very friendly and sweet.  Karen, Rey, and Purine, as well as Michael, were all very friendly and accomodating, this is true.\n\nI would order the dinuguan and pork adobo again, but I won't eat any of it until I'm able to place them in the fridge so that their sauces may gel up and I can skim off the HUGE amount of fat, reheat, and then place them back into the fridge again so that I may re-skim the fat one more time.  Only then would I be able to enjoy these dishes.  They are very tasty, but I have to be careful...  Or I could enjoy them fresh, but without much of the sauce.\n\nWhat my coworker and I definitely agreed on was that we'd both come back just to have the halo-halo again!  This dessert, similar to the Vietnamese Che ba mau, tasted like it was made from fresh ingredients, instead of from a bottled mix of beans, coco strings and jello.  I liked the ice cream they used, too.  You have your choice of either ube, vanilla, or mango.  I'll definitely have to come back and try a bowl of the two Filipino flavors...  As a special, Karen had prepared ginataan, a warm dessert consisting of plantains, jackfruit, coco strings, taro, and something akin to yams, cooked in coconut milk and sugar.  This looked and smelled so very good, but I couldn't try it due to food allergies.  I wonder if Joel had a sample?  I know he enjoyed the cassava... I did, likewise.\n\nAs for the lechon, I'm sad to report that the skin wasn't crispy at all, and I detected a chemical flavor every time I tried the skin.  It tasted much like what a disinfectant might taste like.  A faint hint, but still there, nonetheless.  The pork meat didn't wow me, either.  A big part of the enjoyment of lechon is the Mang Tomas Lechon sauce, which you can buy at Lee Lee supermarket in Chandler (or at Mekong in Mesa).  Awesome sauce, just ask Joel!  I'll have to try the leftover lechon soon with the sauce (I stayed away from it bec. I wasn't sure of the ingredients at the time).\n\nI will definitely be back to try their daily specials.

The pinakbet was a bit of a dissappointment, it was little on the bland and dry side, but I am judging this on how my mother used to make it.\nI asked about any specials coming up, like lechon, and she said that in a couple of weeks they're going to have another lechon roast.

There are a few tables as well as counter seating for eat in, and the tables can be pushed together to accommodate a party of eight or more.\n\nKaren, once an accountant, has turned restaurateur in this family-run venture, which includes her mom, Puring, husband, Ray, and brother, Michael.\n\nIt brings me so much joy to see the love and care that goes into a place that is family owned and independent. The warm smiling faces that greet you at the counter are so genuine and welcoming. Karen and Puring run the front of the store and tail it back to the kitchen to cook.\n\nFor the unfamiliar, many Filipino foods consist of stews, braises and roasts of beef, pork and chicken, which work perfectly for this concept. For the purist you can order a combination plate of classic Filipino dishes and select your own items, or you can go for something more unconventional, yet accessible, like many of its tasty hybrid burritos, chimichangas and flautas.\n\nI must add the menu is more of a guideline rather than something set in stone. If there is something on the menu you find yourself craving, maybe call ahead to make sure she has it that day. Sourcing top quality has been tough, and on a several visits the restaurant was out of one thing or another.\n\nDaily specials play a large part of Karey's menu, and there are always three to five specials per day. If you'd like to know about those dishes, you can choose to follow Karey's Kitchen on Twitter.\n\nOn one visit I created my own three-item combo ($5.99), which included a couple of out-of-this-world pork spare ribs. The barbecue sauce was house-made and had a wonderful slightly smoky and sweet flavor.\n\nI also chose the chicken curry, which was fall-off, the bone tender and not heavy like most I've tried.\n\nTo round off the combo, I chose the pancit, which is the Filipino version of Chinese lo mein. Though rice sticks were used instead of egg noodles, it has a lighter sauce. Of course this was made to order and the vegetables were still slightly crisp.\n\nThe pancit is probably the lightest item on the menu and had plenty of chicken breast and vegetables for those who are watching their figures.\n\nAdobo is to the Philippines as Pho is to Vietnam. Essentially a method of stewing meat brought to the Philipines by the Spanish in the 1500s, it has become the national dish.\n\nKarey's version is absolutely delicious with its rich savory flavors and tender meats. You can have this in a combo or rice bowl, but do yourself a favor and get the Pork Adobo Burrito ($5.99). A huge flour tortilla stuffed with pork adobo then rolled in Parmesan cheese. With the outside rolled in cheese, it adds a depth to the burrito that I've never quite experienced.\n\nWith the burrito you also have your choice of Spanish rice, white rice, garlic rice or beans. The Spanish and garlic rice are moist and flavorful, but my favorite were the creamy beans. Karey's doesn't have a traditional Mexican salsa but instead chooses to use Asian chili paste. The spicy vinegary heat is the perfect complement to every dish I tried.\n\nI love eggrolls in about any shape and form, including Karey's outstanding Filipino version called Lumpia ($2.95/$4.95). These are smaller than what you'd normally expect at an Asian restaurant, but the crunch factor is far bigger. Simply filled with seasoned ground pork and served with a side of sweet chili sauce, these little bad boys are fantastically crispy and light.\n\nKeeping with the hybrid fusion theme, desserts are few but interesting and worth the calories. The Halo Halo ($4.95) is made of shaved ice, beans, purple yams, sweetened condensed milk and ice cream.\n\nOkay, I know, it sounds a little crazy, and when it is served, the first thing that comes up is, \"What have I gotten myself into?\"\n\nThis dessert is brightly colored and unusual in its presentation with so many different layers. Once you brave the first bite, it won't be your last. Creamy, icy, tender and smooth, it's a textural and flavor overload that should be experienced at least once. I have a feeling I'll be having another one on my next visit.\n\nAsk about Puring's Cassava Cake ($1.29). It's served warm and is made from shredded cassava, coconut milk and sugar.\n\nFrom the crispy lumpia to the tender, melt-in-your-mouth adobo, Karen and company cooks how they want to eat and treat their customers how they want to be treated, like family.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 8, "useful": 14, "cool": 12}}, {"text": "Filipino food just like my sister makes!

The adobe is an intensely seasoned beef that I like to mixed into the pancit - a delectable blend of rice noodles and veggies which is made to order with chicken or tofu (yum) as requested.

I asked about pancit and dropped a hint or two that I wanted to try a variety, but couldve been more forceful probing options.  By this time, however, we had already eaten six skewers and I felt a little piggish asking for more. And Karen didnt offer more. Were we hard sold something we didnt want? No.  But I felt gently steered toward a few standard selections and away from other (more exotic?) options, especially considering there was nobody behind us in line.  If the covers were off, or there were pictures, I'd have been more likely to say, \"That looks interesting\" or \"that smells good, what's that?\".   In lieu of a detailed, descriptive menu (there is none, although Karen was verbally descriptive and very helpful) I just think a customer benefits most from a visual display (think Miracle Mile Deli, Panda Express, etc) of ready to eat fare.     \n\nWe stopped by around 5:30pm on a Thursday, and were at Karey's around  fifteen minutes.  There were no other customers.  Zero.  Tons of traffic driving home from work. And nobody.   At this point, I think Karey's is a more sincere than genuinely  savvy operation, but that could change by smoothing a few rough edges,  showcasing all their recipes and maybe a spicier sauce or two.  \n\nTwo minor glitches.  We werent given a receipt copy for our take out order. Also, one of our plastic clamshells leaked on the way home.   The sauce was filled near the brim, but it was messy and annoying.  Good intentions...not so good execution.    \n\nThere's definitely potential here and they're not too far from making this a terrific place with broad appeal.  Who wouldnt root for a relatively unfamiliar cuisine served up by such friendly folks?   But I think (for well intentioned Yelpers) to pretend they've already nailed it, largely on the strength of warm greetings and surprisingly mild fare with exotic names, may be setting Karey's up for a wave of unmet expectations.

Let me explain myself. \n\nThe first time I went to this place (which is just a few blocks from my office), I really liked the food but found the service hit-or-miss (albeit ridiculously friendly). As of April of this year, I had stopped eating meat, so I was unable to order anything from the ready-made lunch buffet. Not the restaurant's fault, per se, but it would have been helpful to know from the extensive \"laundry list\" online menu that fish/tofu items had to be made to order. I did end ordering a noodle bowl with tofu and shrimp but it took 25 minutes. Even though the man helping me was incredibly apologetic, it was frustrating on a busy work day to be so held up. The noodle cake he offered me was also good but hard to eat before I had actually eaten my savory lunch! Again, though, my noodles were greasy but really good. \n\nThe second time I came to Karey's Kitchen, I brought a co-worker. She eats meat, so she ordered items from the lunch buffet. I again ordered something off the menu and we also ordered some vegetarian fried rolls to share. When my food finally came, we dug in. Her pork-based dish was incredibly greasy and she described the meat as being \"suspect.\" My vegetarian dish (essentially a tofu rice bowl) was good but also very greasy. Worst of all, the vegetarian rolls had meat in them! Third strike...\n\nI do truly appreciate how nice the staff at this place was each time there were mess-ups. I was also really impressed by the way they leveraged social networking (Facebook, Twitter) to advertise their opening and spread awareness. I also understand that as a family-owned business, they are short-staffed.

You can imagine the nostalgia that swept over me, then, when I finally found this bakeshop situated near the food court in Arizona Mills.\n\nThe shop looked so pretty- all lit up and all these enticing baked goods wrapped in plastic/cellophane with candy-red printing.  (Hmm... an alarm went off in my head after seeing them all wrapped up.)  The shop looked very clean, with welcoming tables and chairs, and my, how lovely those cake rolls look in the case!  Imagine, then, my disappointment upon reading the nutrition info on these plastic-wrapped goods to find that most, if not all, items are made with margarine, not butter.  These baked goods failed the \"farm vs. factory\" test- ingredients listed sound more like they're mechanically-produced in a factory rather than being all-natural, such as \"flour, eggs, butter, milk,\" etc.  Before sampling what I must admit was a delicious morsel of mocha crunch cake, I asked if the frosting contained powdered sugar.  The sales clerk looked at his coworker, whom I assumed is a manager, who looked at him, then looked at me, and then said \"We think it's whipped cream.\"  Think??  How can you not know what ingredients are used in the products you sell?  I also inquired if any items are made on-site.  No, he said.  Everything is shipped/trucked in, and the only preparations done at the bakeshop are the frying- the FRYING- of the empanadas and the re-heating of the siopao and noodle dishes.  \n\nSorry Red Ribbon, but this Filipina only wants goods baked with butter, not margarine.

So, prior to today, I would have rated them a 3 or 4 star. \n\nToday, I drove out just because my brother had been really craving a good piece of cake. So we trekked it out to Red Ribbon.   Starting with the good.  The eating area was clean.  My almost 2 year old daughter loved playing on the cool orange chairs.  \n\nUnfortunately, my brother & I don't recommend going out of your way, like we did, just to come & try Red Ribbon at AZ Mills.  So, Now with the not so good, my brother decided on a red velvet cupcake.  There were three on a tray along with 3 chocolate mint cupcakes and a white cupcake.  The sales lady told him, \"Oh that's just for display.\"  My brother & I exchange glances, because he was just joking about this possibly happening!   \n\nThe sales lady promptly suggested we buy the four pack of mint chocolate cupcakes. My brother didn't like the look of the chocolate cupcakes, plus he only wanted one!  So, he asked for the only other cupcake option, one white cupcake. She told him it was for display also. \n\nI suggested that maybe they should sell the cupcakes individually. She responded that they do that. So, I was thinking OK, so why can't he order that red velvet cupcake? but oh, well, maybe it was old. \n\nSlightly perturbed, but not yet willing to abandon our quest, i ordered the Ube Boba Shake, because they were out of Mango.  While my bro made his final choice, he noticed there was one white cupcake, that was in the tall refrigerator behind the counter.  It was inside a plastic four pack container, along with one chocolate mint cupcake.  The lady said, \"Oh, that's just icing from a previous mango cupcake...\" My bro asked to see that one anyway. \n\nShe seemed to me, to be reluctant as she went to the fridge & got out the pack. And lo and behold, it was not just icing, it was a white cupcake. Odd that she would tell us that it was just icing. \n\nSo, my brother asked if he could get that one, specifically pointing to the white cupcake in the pack. The lady again, proceeded to put the four pack of mint chocolate cupcakes in a bag... \n\nMy brother & looked at each other again. I told her that this was just confusing and that she looked like she was getting stressed out & I apologized for that. But, my bro wanted that one white cupcake. She finally rung us up for that mango cupcake. Relieved to be done with us, she quickly asked the next customer if she could help them, without giving me my Ube Shake. I asked if it was ready?  Without saying anything, she walked away to the back, then came back & told me they're still making it. In my head, I'm thinking, OK....I just don't get the feeling that we are a valued customer. \n\nWhile waiting for my shake, I tasted the cupcake that was so difficult to get.  I liked the icing, because it was light and not overly sweet.  But the cupcake itself, was nothing special to write about.   My brother also told me he tried their pancit on a previous visit and thought it was, in his words \"Blegh!\"   I told him how I like their chicken empanadas, but he was no longer interested in trying anymore of their food. \n\nWhen I finally got my shake shortly after, it was nice & cold and had a thick texture like a shake should have, but really did not taste great. Mainly because the boba had a strange texture to it, like some parts were hard and some semi soft.   Also, to be fair, I'm usually not an ube fan in general. But, even still, I just thought it tasted bland and with a hint of sweetness/ chalkiness. I guess I was hoping for something more exotic with such a bold purple color. I think the price of $3 something after taxes is high for what you get.   I suggest taking two more steps passed Red Ribbon to Gloria Jeans or Haagen Daz if just want a good shake.  And I will save my Boba Shake cravings for Lollicup or AZ Boba Tea House. \n\nSo unfortunate that we didn't have a good experience at all.  I really want to support our local Filipino restaurants.

I feel bad giving them a 1 star, so I'm giving them an extra star...If Red Ribbon can improve on their customer service at least, then I would recommend people  try it.

So when I came to Phoenix for work, I wanted to see what the Filipino restaurant scene was like.\n\nLike the previous reviewer stated, there are very few Filipino eateries. The supermarket that I found on my GPS was closed, so I found this one on Yelp. Overall, I would recommend to go to support the local Filipino restaurant.\n\nWhen you first walk in, you start in the bake shop area where you'll find cakes and pastries on display. I wasn't sure if I could seat myself, but I was greeted and seated. There were two other tables filled with about 8 people eating including myself. What concerned me is that 2 of the other folks were the only other Filipinos - as I tend to judge all ethnic restaurants by the number of people of the same ethnicity.\n\nBut that logic doesn't seem to work here were the demographics of Filipinos seems relatively low.\n\nI was craving Sisig (grilled pork - which is my favorite at Ongpin in South San Francisco) - but they didn't have that. On the whiteboard, they had Sinigang na Baboy (pork) - so I figured I couldn't go wrong with one of my favorites.\n\nSince I was here on business, I figured I'll order a few other things including the shanghai lumpia (eggrolls), Halo Halo, and topped it off with Hot Pandesal.\n\nThe Sinigang was served in a bowl with 3 pieces of boneless pork. The meat was very tender and you can pull it apart with a spoon and fork. The soup was a little on the salty side since they may have put a little more tamarind mix, but that I might just be a little oversensitive about my sodium intake.\n\nI couldn't help but think that I was eating at home or a family friend's house. Included in the sinigang was spinach, string beans, eggplant, a small potato, and cut onions. What was missing was dikons (those white radish things). It wasn't bad, and it wasn't exceptionally delicious because nothing compares to home made sinigang. But this would be the next best thing. I ate all the meat, and had quite a few eggplants left.\n\nThe shanghai lumpia came out shortly afterwards. The portion was pretty large and I could have shared it with someone else. I didn't care for sauce that it came with. I wanted vinigar, but a filipino family came in and there was only one server.\n\nIf you ever had Halo Halo at Ongpin, you'd find this lacking. It is served it a large plastic cup. What was missing is the ube ice cream. In fact, there was hardly any ube in it. There was a spoonfull of the leche flan, but I didn't finish it.\n\nI actually ordered the Pandesal later, this version was like two very large dinner rolls served with butter. The bread had a fresh out of the oven taste.\n\nThe restaurant section was clean, with standard fare dining. There was a large flatscreen tv with TFC playing.\n\nLast week, when I ate there, they were just written about in the local paper, but I didn't get to read the review.\n\nThey accept Master Card and Visa, but not American express.\n\nI would eat here again to try some of their other dishes not because I want to support my fellow Filipinos, but because the food is actually worth having again. I took some photos of each dish with my iPhone, so I'll have to figure out how to upload them.\n\nThis is actually my first review because I was hoping to read more about Philippine restaurants in the area, I only saw this one.

The decision on what to eat is usually made using the following criteria: Where haven't we been that we can yelp about?\n\nOur last lunch involved us going to Hope Kee and getting all wrapped up in their cutesy snack section and coming in late to work. So we needed somewhere relatively closer with no Hello Kitty gummi lips to distract us from our voyage back.\n\nClarice suggested Casa Filipina, a Filipino place by the Lenny's Burger somewhere near but not necessarily 35th Avenue.\n\nWe were welcomed in by the staff and taken immediately to a nice cozy table by the window. We were given our menus by the excited and talkative waiter I would come later to know as \"that fucking guy\". \n\nAt first I was a little troubled reading the menu. I was once in a relationship with a Filipino girl that was so tumultuous and unloving that when I seriously thought of breaking up with her that my first thought \"but  man, I love her mother's cooking...\". \n\nBut aside from the adobo and lumpia, I saw nothing else on the menu that I could recall from all those awkward awkward family dinners.\n\nI can't tell if this means there's more to the cuisine than I'm aware of or that said ex's mother was, as well as a good cook, a fucking liar. \n\nEither way, I'm glad I left her in the end anyway.\n\nI ordered the Dinguan, which translates as \"chocolate pork\".\n\nDon't be fooled by the name, all you saucy foodies out there thinking of that Iron Chef America where they made savory dishes with chocolate.\n\nChocolate pork is actually pork cooked in pig's blood. \n\nI'll repeat that.\n\nIt's pig's blood. It's called \"chocolate pork\" because the blood takes on a brownish-black hue after it's been cooked.\n\nAfter hearing this from that fucking guy, Clarice changed her original order (we even order the same thing! aren't we just the cutest!) to the Bistek Tagalog, which she was familiar with and knew she would like.\n\nAll the entries come with at CFB is a side of ride. I'm not sure if it's jasmine, white, or saffron, because I always opt for noodles when given the option. \n\nAnd if you get that fucking guy, that rice doesn't even come with soy sauce. After serving us, he disappeared into the bakery, talking it up with some of the other customers. Clarice didn't get her soy sauce until after we had finished our entrees and were on our second helping of rice. \n\nThankfully my chocolate pork came with a lot of sauce and I was able to dribble it on my rice. \n\nThat's right, muchachos. We trannies prefer blood on our rice. You think about that the next time you try to tell us what bathrooms we can use, amigo.\n\nI couldn't taste the pork. All I tasted was the blood. They could've just dumped a quart of blood on my rice and called it a day. The texture was nice though.\n\nClarice wasn't as fortunate with her dish. While I've tried to stay away from beef (it's enough of a commitment to keep my vegetarian brother off my back but not interfere with my eating habits), I had some of the Bistek, and it was passable. It reminded me of beef jerky, with its dry spicy roughness. Good, but not sure if that's how it's meant to taste.\n\nMoral of the story: Clarice's entree did NOT make its own gravy, which made eating her rice a little inconvenient. \n\nAnd seriously, JUST rice (really good rice, but seriously, how hard is it to make good rice)? Even my neighborhood so-poor-it-steals-its-recipes-from-other-restaurants Chinese place gives you an eggroll or wonton with your meal. \n\nAs the place is so fucking proud of its desserts, we ordered some. Clarice got the Creme Brulee and I got the mango tart. That fucking guy was in the middle of bringing Clarice her spoon when he caught the attention of another customer, so we sat for a good few minutes waiting to dig in. In the meantime, I managed to come up with a name for the color of the filling in my tart : burnt earwax. \n\nMy tart was about as tasty and edible as that term would imply.\n\nClarice's creme brulee was good, albeit a little cold by the time that fucking guy came with her spoon.\n\nOn our way out I learned that the bill had to be over 10 dollars before they would accept debit.\n\nAfter I imagined beating every one of the staff near to death with a rolling pin, I got an eclair to go.\n\nWhat I got was a bunch of whipped cream between two pieces of rock-hard pastry that you'd get at Fry's.

Super fresh, sweet cheese filling from end to end, and considerably larger than Goldilocks'. You can instantly tell the difference on how fresh baked these were.

It was a lot of ice, and maybe a little less than 1/4 of cup of the mix\n-Ensaymada: Little disappointed in this one. I think I'm more used to it be a brioche type pastry with sugar, cheese and butter. This one was more of a heavier roll, and seemed a little stale.

For no known reason we decided to go with CF if only for the fact that it was closest to us at the time. This is not in our home area so it's unfamiliar territory for us but we ventured on until we found it in a run of the mill shopping plaza with a Big Lots (a nice bonus since it was actually open on Easter so we got to do some after lunch browsing).\n\nWe didn't know what to expect from CF but we know we weren't disappointed. The small bakery opens up into a pretty good sized restaurant with a good amount of tables. There were several other parties there including what looked like an after church Easter family gathering of about 12. Good sign #1.\n\nWe were greeted warmly and seated right away. We were surprised at the menu choices and excited about the options they had. Of course, there are some Filipino dishes we wished they had but hey, you can't have everything. What they did have was pretty darn good.\n\nWe ordered the sisig [see-sig] (sauteed bits of pork with onions) and the pancit malabon [pon-sit muh-law-bone] (noodles with sauce, hard boiled eggs, shrimp and cruched chicharon, or pork rind chips, on top). I also got sago to drink (sweet syrupy drink with tapoica pearls and sweet rice jelly) b/c it made me think fondly of family parties when my dad would always make a punch bowl of the stuff. \n\nThe food was flavorful and offered good portion sizes.

It has thicker noodles and comes with mini shrimp and hard boiled eggs. My 2nd favorite type of pancit.\n   Kare Kare - Here it's made with beef or pork.

I have been searching for some time now, trying to find a Filipino Restaurant that my wife would approve of.  When we were last in Las Vegas, she wanted us to go back to Pinoy Pinay which she stated was her favorite place to eat Filipino foods in the US.  Glory be!!!!  Now I do not have to take her all the way to Las Vegas for her native dishes anymore.  We made a trip into Phoenix to try this small Filipino restaurant/bakery that I came across on the internet.  The reason for the trip was that it was her son's birthday and I thought that it would be a treat to get out and about.... we live in Casa Grande.  (I actually wanted a Mango Cake for his birthday and the internet stated that they had them here.)  Immediately, my wife and kids felt at home. (Her children just arrived from the Philippines in July of 2013.)  Looking at all of the beautiful pastries in their showcase was just too much for this guy to contain.  We sat down and I had the kids order what ever they wanted to eat.  While waiting for the dishes, I decided that maybe we should try the different tarts in the showcase.  I ordered one of each for them to try and we loved them all.  After a very filling lunch, the Mango Cake I had requested with a birthday greeting on it was served at the table and the staff sung him \"Happy Birthday\" which was totally out of surprise.  But we were too full to eat any part of the cake so we boxed it up to take home.  But we could not leave without those yummy tarts, so I ordered 3 of each to take home with us.  Our son had a piece a bit later and he stated that it tasted like a \"piece of Heaven\", and that is coming out of a 19 year old teenager.  Imagine that!  All in all, the 1 hour trip to Phoenix for this wonderful and tasty meal was well worth the time and effort and we will be looking forward to visiting this small piece of the Philippines in the near future.  Casa Filipino Bakeshop & Restaurant, thank you for the wonderful food, service and atmosphere.

For some reason, the expected flavors were flat and notes to plateau and climax were severely missing.\n\nThe Sisig ($7.99) encompassed diced pork and pork ears saut\u00e9ed with garlic, onions, lemon juice, and fresh chopped jalapenos. Given all the sharp tasting ingredients, the flavors should have been far more robust, striking, and complicated. To the chef's credit, the positives were the food did not appear greasy; and the textures came out firm and not overcooked. The side of pancit was lacking flavor, and unfortunately, equally unimpressive. I've had all of these items homemade, so the experience was modest at best given this being one of the only two Pin@y bakeries in the area.\n\nUbe Hopia ($4.99) was my least favorite item from the bakery. The exterior was noticeably staled without the fresh flaky textures. Although the purple ube filling was delicious, the air pocket inside was too big for me to recommend it. To this day, my favorite Pin@y bakery is still Valerio's.\n\nDespite the limitations, the Sago't Gulaman ($2.50) was truly outstanding. It came in a big glass of tapioca, gelatin, and crushed ice. The drink was impressively refreshing to counteract against the hot summer weather. Of all the things I've tried so far, this is one item that I'd highly recommend.\n\nService was friendly and kind, but the food did take some time to arrive at our table. I still believe their food is a good gateway for those experiencing Pin@y cuisine for the first time. However, their targeted audiences could be much more inclusive of those who have already been introduced to the cuisine.

My mother is from the Philippines and I have grown up around authentic Filipino food (and can make some of it myself), so I can tell you that this place is straight-up The Real Deal.\n\nWhen I first heard from the owners of Pinoy's Best that there would be a Filipino restaurant in Surprise, I knew to keep my eye out for when it would become a reality. Now it's here and it's very delicious. Or, in Tagalog, \"masarap-sarap!\"\n\nMy mother and I visited for lunch and were immediately impressed by the rather extensive menu. Some items aren't available every day, but it's still a really impressive selection. We ordered adobo pusit, pork menudo, and pancit canton. My mom hadn't eaten Adobo Pusit in quite a while - squid in vinegar and soy marinade - and she was really excited to taste it. It didn't disappoint.\n\nThe pork menudo was also delicious. They even included liver in the dish, which to me screams authentic; I always feel like there's a fight over the liver pieces between my Filipino uncles once the pickings get a little slim. The carrots and potatoes were perfectly cooked and the sauce was rich and satisfying.\n\nAlthough the pancit was good, it was a little salty for my taste. If anything, my only (small!) complaint is that the food was rather salty - but if you've ever eaten authentic Filipino food, you'll know that a lot of the food is very salty and sometimes there's just no getting around that. While nothing beats my Auntie Rose's amazing pancit, I still liked the pancit here.\n\nAs we finished our meal, we decided to take home a little bit of food for dinner. We ordered lechon kawali. We discovered when we got home that the portion wasn't very big and that they forgot to include rice, so that was a tad disappointing - but nothing that would keep us from ordering it again.\n\nWe also took home a little bit of puto (now, don't get this confused with Spanish - in Filipino, puto is a muffin-shaped steamed bread made with rice flower). There was a little bit of cheese on top of it. It was a perfect treat!\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my experience at Pinoy's Bistro. The service was very good and the atmosphere just right for a lunch spot. The prices were fair and the portions were generally very good (especially the pancit). \n\nOne cool thing about paying at Pinoy's: they use Square to accept payments. Square is reaching a higher adoption rate every day, from what I can tell, after taking off with tech-savvy cafes and restaurants mostly in large metro areas. When you use cards that are tied to your account in Square, you can get a receipt e-mailed or texted to you, plus at Pinoy's they keep track of your visits and you get a stamp on your virtual loyalty card for every visit! We have yet to see what the loyalty card reward is, but I'm sure we'll find out soon as we plan on going back before too long.\n\nLike I said, we'll be back.

I don't want to sound ignorant, but when I was served the Chicken Tinola, with a single bony piece of chicken in a small cup of broth, and a pile of stark white rice, I was shocked. My husband, a fan of soul food, ordered pig knuckles and had to gnaw on a nearly meatless bone for his dinner. I sent back my meal and filled up on diet soda and the delicious putos.

But apparently, it is gone and this went in in its place.  A family-owned Filipino restaurant.  I was in heaven and we went in instead of leaving to find another deli.  \n\nI ordered their pork lumpia (12 pieces) and their traditional pancit Bihon (I think this was the 2nd word)...two things I grew up absolutely loving when I lived in Mira Mesa (San Diego) surrounded by a ton of my Filiipino friends.  My best friend's mom made the BEST pancit and lumpia and it has been years and years since I have had any. I used to eat it at least once a week. Mmmmmmmmm. \n\nThe lumpia was just okay.  The meat wasn't ground up with the veggies, but rather more of a stick of pork wrapped.  Meh.  Reminded me of eating fake crab at a sushi restaurant.  Their sweet chili sauce was perfect though!  \n\nOkay, so then, they brought out what I was really really waiting for...my pancit!  When she set it down in front of me, I could already tell I was too excited for absolutely no reason.  There was no color to the noodles.  They looked like they had been taken straight out of the boiling water and placed on my plate.  Rice noodles are supposed to be practically see-through, but these were just as white as they were when they were taken out of the package. There were 2 slices of lemon, chopped carrots, some cabbage...and are you ready for this?  The pieces of chicken looked like they had only been boiled as well as the pieces of shrimp (I've never had traditional pancit with shrimp...so it's a good thing I am not allergic).  No type of seasoning/sauce or anything!  Soooo not traditional to me!  I know there are different regions or versions, but this is certainly not what I am accustomed to eating at my filipino Ate's or Tiya's houses.  I unwillingly squeezed my lemon over it and took a bite.\n\nOMG!  It took everything I had not to spit it out and get up to leave.  It lacked so much flavor it's not even funny.  Well, there was no flavor.  I felt like I was eating lemon flavored noodles.  The chicken was an afterthought and I couldn't even taste it.  \n\nHow could they?!  I am so upset and annoyed by this.  I am so glad I have had true traditional pansit because if this had been my first taste I would have sworn off the deliciousness of Filipino food for life.  \n\nMy friend had their chicken adobo and she thought it was just okay.

We had heard good-ish reviews for Mabuhay, and were excited to try a new style of food. Unfortunately, the whole experience, from start to finish, ended up being terrible, which led us to give the restaurant the nickname of \"Mabu-bye.\" We actually walked out of the restaurant before we had even taken a single bite of food, but, lest you think I'm being unfair in this review, please read the whole thing.\n\nThe restaurant is located in a small strip mall along S Park Street, which wasn't a big deal to us because some of our favorite restaurants have been located in strip malls. Our first warning of things to come should have been that there was only one other car parked in the lot at 6:00 pm on a Saturday evening, but we walked in anyway. Upon entering the restaurant, we discovered that there was no one at the cash register, and no indication of whether to seat ourselves or wait for someone to seat us. We saw one waiter running around getting drinks for the 3 tables that were eating, but he never once looked at us. After standing awkwardly in the entrance for a few minutes, we decided to just sit down at a table, at which point a woman who had been sitting and eating at one of the other tables got up and said, \"Yes, wherever you want.\" Well, that would've been helpful a few minutes ago!\n\nSo, we sat down at a table, and the waiter came over another few minutes later to ask if we wanted drinks. Both The Wife and I ordered water, which he brought out, but  it was lukewarm (no ice at all) and the glasses were barely 3/4 full. He then walked away without saying a word about ordering food.\n\nNow, going in, we knew that the food would be served buffet style, but the waiter did not say whether we could just go up to the buffet or whether he would bring us plates to use first. So, I got up and went to look at the buffet. I discovered a stack of maybe 6 plates that I thought were clean (though I'm still not sure they were), some silverware, and one bowl. I also glanced at the buffet items, and thought, \"Oh, god, what have we gotten into?\" The Wife came up to join me at the buffet, and while she was looking over the options, I started to serve myself some rice. I dug the rice scoop into the rice cooker only to discover that the rice was so overcooked that it was too hard to push the scoop into. So, I changed my mind about the rice and went to look more closely at the other food options.\n\nNone of the dishes were labeled, so it was a complete guessing game as to what food you might be serving yourself. The stuff that looked like chicken skewers were just sitting in a metal tray perched precariously on the edge of the buffet station, but they looked old and dry. One of the pasta dishes looked so slimy that it literally made me gag, and the other noodle dish looked old and crunchy, which is not how I ever want to eat noodles. The remainder of the dishes looked funky, old (like they had been sitting out for a while), and, again, we had absolutely no idea what any of them actually were.\n\nGiven how terrible EVERYTHING looked and how bad our initial service experience had been, we set our plates back on the table, left $1 to tip for the water, and walked out.

On one side of the boat was a small bowl of white fish ceviche and on the other side was a bowl of diced tomato, onions, salted egg, and pink anchovie paste (somewhat like a Filipino salsa).  Everything was delicious...can't really think of anything I'd change.  My husband and I hope that they will have a half version of this boat for people who dine in small groups as this one can easily feed a group of 6 people.\n\nTo top my mom's birthday, the Chef brought out 4 generous desserts for each person (including our 7 year old son).

We topped it off with Buko Pandan (2.99) and Sago at Gulaman (2.49). The Buko Pandan is basically green jello mixed in a sweet coconut juice nectar and whipped cream. The Sago at Gulaman is considered a drink but would more classify as a dessert because of how sweet it is with its sugar based water mixed with sweet jelly and boba pieces.\n\nNext time I come back, I will definitely order something different so I have an excuse to try their whole menu eventually.

Both of us have Filipino running through our veins so this was definitely a no brainer.\n\nThis restaurant is in one of my favorite strip malls ever! I often frequent this area as they hold a lot of my favorite restaurants: Sushimon, Shabu Grill, Starbucks and more. When I entered the joint, the first thing I thought was HOLY RED! The floors, the walls, everything is red. I'm glad they took the opportunity to paint some brown on the wall and include green plants. It certainly broke up the monotony of red but turned into a Christmas tree. Not a big deal though, and I'm glad they had a lot of seating in the restaurant. Great for big parties. Our server was a young girl, super sweet and accommodating. She was quick and really made us feel welcome. For dinner, here's what I got:\n\nMy friend and I started with the Full House Trio Appetizer for $7.99. This 12 piece app was filled with Lumpia Shanghai, jumbo fish balls and pork pot stickers, served with a trio of dipping sauces. For sauces, my favorite was the citrus soy sauce. The lumpia was super delicious! The wrapping was crispy and light. I thought the fish balls were a little soggy, maybe because it was the end of the evening. Also, the pot stickers were nicely cooked on the outside, but the inside wrapper was a little slimy and not the best in my opinion.\n\nFor dinner, I got the sizzling Lechon Pinakbet for $8.99. Two things I love: Lechon and Pinakbet! I didn't believe it when they said sizzling but the plate came out super hot! Flavor wise, I LOVED the elements and textures of this dish! The pumpkin, green beans, okra bitter melon and eggplant was perfectly cooked. I LOVED how they didn't mix the pork together. It allowed the crispy skin to really shine through! Loved it all except one thing. The bagoong, or shrimp paste, used in this dish was really strong because the sizzling platter continued to reduce the sauce as it sat on our table. That meant a very salty dish. Please be advised.\n\nAt the end of the evening, I had a great dinner. I'm definitely going to keep this place on my list of Filipino joints to frequent in the future.

Please continue to read..\n\nI'm not a Vegas native, I am in fact from the Bay Area. There are a good amount of Filipinos who live here obviously. I myself am Filipino, and as much as I try to support Filipino chains and small businesses, I am always disgusted by them. Why? Because they always seem like a rip off. Not only that, service is slow. Prices are high for below or average taste. And portions are extremely small for the price. It's also surprising how many people still frequent these Filipino restaurants we have here in the Bay Area that are Filipino and not realize the things I just mentioned. Perhaps they are blinded and skewed by the fact that they are supporting a local Filipino business, or maybe because they can't cook Filipino food. It must not be the latter because us Filipinos take so much pride in cooking those who know how to cook the dishes won't think twice to criticize the same dish made by someone else and how theirs is always better. Am I not right? I guess for your quick fix of Filipino food, we have plenty of choices here in the Bay Area, but they suffer from the previously mentioned. If I go to these Filipino chains, it's mostly for buying a Birthday cake or other pastries. The ship for buying regular entrees have long sailed. Be thankful for parents or other relatives who can cook authentic Filipino dishes. It's ashame that future generation of Filipinos who don't even know how to speak Tagalog will think this is good Filipino food for the price. If the price was lower or portions were grander sure no problem. But portions are small, and most if not all the food seems like it's just heated, and hell--they have no shame showing you that they just microwave them. To add insult to injury, Goldilocks (I'm not sure if they still do this practice), will weigh the food from the a la carte dishes to the palabok. Now why do these Filipino owned businesses and chains wonder why only Filipinos go to their stores and restaurants? If the Bay Area wasn't filled with so many Filipinos, I doubt these places would stay open. Vietnamese, Hawaiian, Thai have appealed to everybody recently, and have easily passed up Filipino food as general favorites for everybody. \n\nWhile in Vegas, for some odd reason we wanted to get some Filipino food. Not being from around here, we consulted the GPS. Having a GPS is very handy and I highly recommend it when going to places you are not familiar with, but thats an entirely different review on it's own. Pinoy Pinay came up so off we headed. I don't know the area nor it's reputation, but it wasn't too far off from the strip. It was in a small plaza center which seemed like it housed other Filipino/Asian businesses. The exterior was nothing special. It wasn't nice, but wasn't bad either. The ambiance of the interior was that of a typical fast food type of chain. There was plenty of seating arrangements and the space felt roomy. Never did I feel congested. \n\nNow the differences that I quickly realized were the prices, portions, and service of this place. Wow, its the 3 top complaints that I and other Filipinos and non-Filipinos have about Filipino restaurants here in the Bay. I should have got a copy of the menu and uploaded it, but I forgot to snag one. I can't remember in detail, but prices were very reasonable. Actually in comparison to those from your local Chinese fast food restaurant. The prices were actually CHEAP compared to those of Bay Area prices. But what good are the cheap prices of portions are small. No worries there, the portions were surprisingly generous from what I'm use to seeing from Filipino chains. Us Filipinos are known to run on Filipino time, slow and usually late. Here in the Bay Area, we prove that stereotype by exercising it in the workplace. It's in full effect in Filipino restaurants here. Jollibee, Goldilocks, and other Filipino places are very slow. Just because I'm Filipino does not mean I'm your relative or even your friend where you start talking to me like I've known you forever. A simple hello and small BS will suffice. I'm here for my food and time is money. The staff at Pinoy Pinay restaurant knows this, and have setup the food line in a efficient manner. One person manning a different station. It moved the line quickly and I was shocked that they were waiting on me. Over here in the Bay it's almost always the opposite. \n\nWe went here before the afternoon on a weekday and even then it had a good amount of patrons. Mostly if not all Filipinos, but there was a token black guy that showed up. A black guy in a Filipino restaurant--that was proof enough for me. If the traffic was as it was when we came, I could only imagine during later hours of the day and on the weekends this place would be busy.\n\nThis place is what Filipino restaurants are not in the Bay Area, but what should be.

I just recently went here with my hubs and mom.  We were very disappointed on what we got.  We went here by chance because we needed to eat, I didn't exactly know where Seafood City was, and I didn't want to drive up and down Sahara.  Coming from SD and I have many selections of different turo turo (point point) places and never really came upon a place that wasn't good.  So I didn't think much of this place on not being good.  There were ppl inside eating...\n\nFirst off, they make you get a tray.  The tray I got smelled like it was wiped with a wet dirty towel.  It had a disgusting sour smell and I didn't understand why they wanted ppl to eat with it.  The guy behind the counter was pretty adamant on us getting a tray.  I got the tray, but I didn't want to put my food down on it.  SO GROSS!\n\nWhat I got:\nI decided on their beef steak.  The guy asked if I wanted sabaw (okay, the sauce) on my rice, heck ya!  I just wanted one entree choice with my rice.  \n\nWhy it wasn't good:\nFirst, the rice.  It seemed like old rice they reheated and put too much water on because it got too dried out.  My beef steak wasn't good at all.  The sauce of the beef steak seemed too oily and it didn't taste fresh.  It also tasted like it was cooked a long time ago and just reheated.  They just looked like they cut up fresh onion and topped with it to look like it was recently cooked. \n\nWhat the hubs got:\nHe got paksiw na lechon and sinigang na HALIBUT.  Yea, thats right, they put HALIBUT in with the sinigang.  I never had and now I know why.  If you're going to make any type of FISH sinigang...fricken make it with BANGUS!  I know they had bangus because they had one all fried up in the front.    \n\nWhy it wasn't good:\nMy husband is on of those filipinos who love really sour sinigang.  When he asked the guy if it was extra sour, the guy had no hesitation to say yes.  When hubs went to try it, the sabaw (soup) was barely sour.  He also agreed to not eat sinigang with halibut, it just didn't taste right.  As for his paksiw, that also tasted like it was cooked a long time ago and just reheated.  The sauce of the paksiw was way over powering and didn't taste that good either.\n\nWhat mom got:\nShe also got the sinigang and she also got afritada.  I didn't taste it because I was already disgusted with my food and my husbands.  I doubt that tasted any better. \n\nI don't know if they were lazy to cook stuff for a Saturday evening and again and just reheated old food.  I surprised that so many ppl like the food from here.  But I will definitely not come here again and will make it a point to find Seafood City, because I heard there are more places to eat around there.  \n\nPpl from Vegas or ppl visiting vegas...don't go here...seriously....your lola/mom/auntie/lolo/dad/uncle or YOUSELF who know who to cook will be disappointed with the food from here.

I should begin the review with an explanation/disclaimer; growing up, after finding out what everything was, in filipino cuisine, I became a picky eater. I was the one cutting off all the fat off the meat. I don't like greasy foods, in general (plus, being pregnant, things are not always agreeing with my system). I stuck to safe things because in all honesty, I don't eat all animal flesh (limit it to beef, chicken, sometimes pork, turkey, seafood and shellfish). And it's not like I don't eat fatty foods at all, I just select the days (I eat carefully on most days, but on the weekends, I eat what I want; it helps my figure). We don't go to a lot of filipino restaurants (but this doesn't mean that I'm less of a Pinay, I know alot about the history, I do know Tagalog, though I am not fluent, and I could go on and on about Pinoys in Hollywood, believe me, I am proud). \n\nLocated in Amall, on the corner of Sahara and Maryland Parkway (the one with 7-11 on the corner), the cafeteria-style restaurant  (you select your items and pay at the end of the aisle, before sitting down to eat) is located in the elbow of the strip mall. Inside is spacious with lots of seating, tables & chairs. Trays are placed on top of the trash cans located near the doors. Bathrooms are located in the back of the restaurant. It is clean, however, we did see a dirty tray (had food stuck on it), which the employee promptly picked up upon seeing that it was set aside. And when we sat down, noticed that there was a B grade up on the wall. My husband also noticed that something was cleaned up with a dirty rag, which was then placed on top of the counter. \n\nWe had cousins, and my auntie, in town so we met them here for lunch last saturday afternoon. My husband and I each chose the two-item plates (two scoops of rice, pancit, and BBQ sticks), a drink, and I also got the bibingka, and my husband got the turon (oops, forgot to tell him it was made with filipino bananas). The cashier was nice and cracked a joke about the sticky balls on a stick (carioca). The rice was plentiful, the BBQ sticks were cold and more on the fatty side, and the pancit was ok. (Also, another reason why I am picky with filipino food is that my mom's pancit and lumpia were the best. When there is such a high standard, it's hard to have anything else). The caldereta did look good, and maybe I would've enjoyed my lunch if I had that instead. Ok, I have to share this funny story abut our nephew, my sister's oldest. I didn't know that he liked dinuguan, and I told him what it was before he ordered it, when we were in line. He was eating it, and had this uncertain expression on his face. And then said, \"What is this?\" My immediate reaction was to laugh heartily, as I always do (sorry, I have a loud laugh). My husband later said that he wished he had recorded the whole thing (see, he can't have dessert unless he finishes the meal, it's the rule). I did enjoy the bibingka, I do love filipino desserts! Masarap. The turon @ $1.50 was really good and such a generous size too. The cost of our meals was over $21.00. My sister, brother-in-law, and their older boys split a couple halo-halo's- served in glass dishes similar to ice cream sundaes, which looked good, but I love Chow King's version (in Seafood City). If I wanted some filipino dessert, I could stop here, since it's in the neighborhood.  \n\nThere were other customers in the restaurant but I would't say that it was crowded, especially for the weekend (when we moved here in 1991, there weren't many choices and now due to a higher pinoy population, there are lots of choices for us; and the most popular is Seafood City).", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I'm not a fan of filipino fast food but when you really want filipino food and you are away from your mom, this is one of the few places you can go to and get it done right.

Nanay Gloria's on Maryland Parkway used to be a good deal for your dollar, but things have changed, and I feel, it's to save money as much as possible.  Firstly, if you have children between the ages of 1-3 years old, they will be charged.  It doesn't sound like a lot--$1.99, but more respectable buffet eateries don't usually subscribe to such practices.  Still, they didn't use to do this.  Secondly, they've gotten rid of trays.  Yes, trays.  This is a cafeteria style buffet line, and you are expected to fill your plate and carry it to your table by hand.  That means multiple trips back to get water and your silverware.  God forbid that you happen to be carrying soup...and with a kid in tow.  Talk about an accident waiting to happen.  I honestly feel they got rid of the trays to discourage customers from filling their plates.  I actually asked them why they got rid of them, and no one could give me a decent answer.  But, trays are just practical at any eatery, and I strongly condemn this restaurant for  getting rid of them.  I've always liked their kare-kare (ox-tail and tripe in a peanuty broth) which is always complemented by a sauteed shrimp paste (known as ginisang bagoong).  I remember how I used to love their sauteed shrimp paste.  Now, it tastes as if the shrimp paste is coming straight from the jar without being sauteed.  The pancit was left wanting, as it was more noodle than anything.  There were big chunks of the \"rootier\" parts of the cabbage--not the leafy part, and it left the dish tasting too bitter.   Their curried chicken at the time I dined there, had veggies that were undercooked, and I happened to scoop up the chicken's neckbone, which, in my opinion, wasn't going to do a ravenous diner any favors.  Do they expect that I'll be sucking on a length of neckbone just to lap up the last bits of curry?  If they want to add it for flavoring, they should remove it prior to serving.  The dessert items are very limited.  They always have a hot dessert on the food line, but the selection of fruits and other sweets were very limited.  Trying to sit down to a clean table was almost impossible.  Even the cleanest table that we were at felt sticky to the touch.  They need to not only remove dishes, but they need to really wipe down their tables (and chairs) better.  In all, I think Nanay Gloria's likes to rely on the reputation it had in the past.

They're definitely a much better lunch and dinner restaurant than a special events catering facility.  \n\nAt Lunch:  For the price $9-12 dollars for most lunch specials, you get pretty good food. Their wait persons are very nice.  The food is authentic and fresh, and the presentation is good.  There are lots of families inside this open type of layout so it's kind of loud and lively. The five of us tried many different dishes including the sinigang, kare kare, lichon, pansit, fried seafood. and all were pretty good.   \n\nOf course my extroverted sister, like always, made friends with the table to our right.  Next thing we know, they're trying out some of our stuff and vice versa.  I was too full to try anything else, though. There's something about Filipinos around the table sharing food and conversation. Actually I was saving up for their delicious bibinka.  \n\nOne thing I didn't like was their  pansit, the noodle dish. Theirs had way too much fish sauce.  I guess I'm used to my mom's home made version which has more flavor with only a tad fish sauce.. Salo Salo's desserts are overall good, esp. their excellent bibingka baked in banana leaf.  IMO this is the best thing they make.  I also like their halo halo.  \n\nThe banquet room  1.0 star\n\nWe liked their lunch food enough that we decided to have my parents' anniversary party there. Turns out, that wasn't such a good idea. As a banquet venue, they were below expectations.  It cost about $33 a person and there were about 100 of us.  For that, we got their pre-cooked bland lumpia and pansit, white rice, and three entrees cooked in bulk and kept lukewarm, sort of  It was buffet style, I thought there would be more entrees. Nope  We got our own room, but it was not well appointed as the main restaurant. It was like being put in the spare storage room with sparse decorations. \n\nWe did get \"entertainment\" however.  Well, sort of.  He was a DJ and singer, supposedly.  The most recent song he played as a DJ was Cher's \"Believe'. We had our party in 2008, and that Cher song was around 2000? We did like some of the old disco tunes.  But with 1/3 of the attendees under  30, we wanted to hear Hip Hop and modern dance music.  He didn't have any hip hop or rap songs as a DJ in Vegas? What's up with that?. As far as his singing: he could sing okay over his too much echo karaoke machine.  \n\nIMO it was NOT worth the   $33 dollars a person.

It was very easy to find, located in a strip mall about 10 minutes away from our hotel.\n\nScene: KID IN A CANDY STORE!!  That's what I felt like when I looked at the menu.

I was happy to see it was the version that came topped with sauce and long noodles rather than the short fat noodles with the sauce stirred in already.\nCrispy Pata - A little too over-fried but the pork hock was delicious nonetheless.  The vinegar sauce was a great complement.  My hubby couldn't resist picking up the bone to gnaw off as much crispy meat as he could.\nKare-Kare - I'm always used to other places cheaping out on the oxtail but these guys spared no expense.  I counted 4 or 5 pieces of oxtail along with tripe and green beans, eggplant and bok choy.  The housemade bagoong was complex, briny and delicious.\nSizzling Sisig - This was probably our biggest disappointment.  It didn't sizzle and that was probably due to the vast amount of liquid the pork was sitting in.  However, the pork still tasted delicious and was very tender.\nGarlic Fried Rice - It'd be tough to mess this up.  Super tasty although we couldn't eat much of it.\n\nWe ended up packing the kare kare, garlic fried rice and sisig to go to snack on in our hotel room later tonight.  \n\nBut in the meantime, we ordered some halo halo for dessert.

The tripe is plentiful as well but not as enticing to eat because they use huge pieces instead of cutting them down\nGrilled Eggplant - This was a cheap side dish which I think was totally worth the $3 we paid.  I don't know if they really smoked it or just used liquid smoke but it the heady smokey flavor was delicious, especially when paired with the accompanying bagoong.

Service was prompt and we sat on their front patio/atrium (its indoors).  I was all prepared to order a San Miguel Beer which is the Filipino national beers, when our waitress informed me of some tragic news: They dont serve alcohol.  I had to recover from this stomach blow and in my confusion I selected a coconut juice drink.  It was fine, but minimal in size and not really the appropriate compliment to what food was going to be forthcoming.  \n\nAs for the food, we HAD to order the Chicken Adobo.  Not ordering that is like going to New Orleans and not having a biegnet or Hurricane drink.  We also ordered Palabok, which are noodles topped in a fish gravy and then covered with pork rinds.  Finally, we got some Vegetable Limpia which is a type of spring roll.   The presentation of all the dishes was pleasant but once I dug in, I noticed a common theme..........Salt!!!!!!  Salt is a critical component to all cooking but when I taste it in abundance I feel its the hallmark of a lazy kitchen.  Rather than expertly prepare their array of spices, many kitchens will just add salt to give a dish some flavor.  I kind of felt that was the case here and thats tragic because the chicken was tender and juicy and the noodles were expertly cooked.  The limpia had fresh vegetables but all the sauces that accompanied the dishes was just way to salty.  See why the beer would have come in handy now?\n\nPrices were all very reasonable and the portions were generous.  I feel that Salo-Salo has in it the makings of a fine restaurant, they just need to want to take it to another level.  Then again, the Filipino's I know seem to love it, so why should they change?  Perhaps its this discontinuity why Filipino food has yet to take off and really make it mainstream.  Until that happens, Salo Salo is a fine enough place for this type of ethnic food, but dont expect to see Anthony Bourdain in here anytime soon.\n\nPS- There are 2 locations in Southern California as well.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Salo-Salo Grill is an impressive Filipino restaurant.

This is always good and a nice start to the meal. (There are garlic peanuts for sale if you like the sample that they give). \n\nThe kare kare was one of the first dishes served and I liked the presentation of the kare kare because they put this in a traditional Filipino palayok or clay pot. It comes out nice and hot and the peanut butter broth is perfect for topping off the rice. There was plenty of veggies in this in terms of eggplant and greens. The veggies and the broth is always my favorite for kare kare. I did notice their didn't seem to be a lot of meat in this though. (The veggies for me are the best part anyways). \n\nThe sinigang soup was nice and sour and had a fair share of veggies and tomato.

The meat they put in this though could have been a little bit leaner. \n\nThe bangus fish they served was huge! I think our party only got through a quarter of the fish! \n\nThe crispy pata was good. It was fried just right and was not to hard. It's good to match this with kare kare or sinigang. I also liked dipping the crispy pata in the vinegar dipping sauce that they provide. \n\nThe turon delight was our dessert. Their turon delight is mini banana egg rolls (maybe about 8?) and then in the middle is some ice cream. The ice cream is a Filipino ice cream flavor - the night when we had it I believe it was jack fruit.

I wash it all down with either melon juice or calamansi juice.  I end my meal with one of my favorite Filipino desserts - leche flan!

Originally, my idea of Filipino food was greasy pork and horribly cut chicken wings cooked in adobo sauce served in a buffet line. I'm so glad I had dinner with my girlfriend's family here for a real authentic Filipino dinner. The prices are affordable as any other Asian restaurant which is $8 for an entree. \n\nOur family had prawn sinigang, fried milk fish, spicy coconut chicken, and some sort of BBQ sampler. Let me just begin by saying that nothing is more like comfort food to a filipino than fried fish + sinigang and boy did it hit the spot. Hot sour soup with fish and rice on a cold day really speaks comfort for itself. As a Thai man, I must say I was very pleased with my spicy coconut chicken. It was creamy, mildly spicy and delicious. My only complaint would be small pieces of tendon in my chicken that were not carefully removed during the deboning of the chicken (which is difficult!) Lastly, the BBQ sampler was nicely seasoned and tasted great. We then finished with torron (fried banana) with ice cream. I HIGHLY recommend this dessert because they add this crispy rice to the ice cream which adds a lot of texture to the dessert. You take a bite of fried banana with ice cream and each bite has a great crunch and smooth soft texture on the inside and it is just amazing.\n\nThe owner (I assumed) then came out to greet us and made sure the food was okay. There is honestly nothing that shows you care more about the customers than coming and checking on them and I highly appreciate this.\n\nAll in all, Salo Salo is not THAT different from good 4-star Asian restaurants, but I'm giving it 5 stars for the following reasons:\n\n1.

But this recent nrws really knock my appetite to the food. Yet Iam here to tell you that I didnt rate them because of the recent news (roach infestation.) Rather iam writing this rating with the same criteria I have been giving other food places.\n\nWe ordered:\nChopsuey\nPancit bihon \nAnd family set( includes ; bbq pork and chicken, squid, and arellanong bangus.\nRice\n\nLets start with the chop suey. The vegetables were fresh and the flavor is there when it comes to the chop suey taste that filipino style shouls be but the chicken that came with the chop suey was dried up. So dry that we didnt touch it.\nNext the pancit, it was probably the one thing that i ate alot of on the bunch, it taste good, and has all the flavor i want frpm a pancit.\nLastly the big family plate which contains different food, the beef bbq is probably the only thing that was near the taste that is near the standard of pinoy beef bbq. The chicken bbq was we only took 1 bite out of it, 4 sticks remained on the platter. The arellanong bangus was okay, but it tasted not fresh, as well as the squid, which i may add has only the bbq sauce on top of it, and smoked. I would have done better prepartion on it, no to mention , it tasted days old or refrigerated.\n\nRegardless of the ROACH infestation which we saw momenta before we eat, i find this place pricey with foods that are not as highly as other yelpers say.\nMaybe my standards of pinoy foods are high, but when a chicken bbq is so messed up that the bbq chicken that I make home made is way better than what you sell, then theres a problem. \n\nLastly I would not reccomend anyone to eat here. I dont know if its true but they should have the GRADE C on their door, I may be wrong but its either they have never put it out, or they have been inspected again since January i cant find an update about the roach infestation.\n\nThis will be the last time i will eat here, i took a chance to see if the flavor and taste are what the other yelpers said are true, even in the midst of knowing what might be back on that kitchen.

When I walked in to pay, the waitress said there had to be a minimum $20 for card use ($20 is kind of a lot for a minimum! Especially if you're dining alone). I totally understand this rule and where it comes from, but I just completely did not have cash on me at all. I told them that they can just put an extra charge or whatever that most stores do when you don't reach the minimum. The lady was nice enough to say \"it's all right, but next time just remember that we charge a minimum $20.\" So all was cool until they continued to twist my arm to buy more things after that statement. They were probably half joking, but that can definitely make a customer feel uncomfortable, which it made me feel.\n\nSo all in all, this place still has amazing food that will blow your palate away if you've never had Filipino food or even if you have, it's still really good!

There was no meat on the lechon pieces and the skin was soggy instead of crunchy. Their pork belly slices were really dry and their barbeque was a rip off only because at other filipino restaurants, you can get more meat than you do here. There's only like 3 pieces of meat on a skewer and or 3 skewers it would cost you $/7.99. Take Fiesta Filipina, you can get at the least 8 meat pieces on the skewer and 3 skewers for under $7.00 with rice included. Their Sabaw Manok was lacking in flavor.

We waited for at least 30 minutes while Andy was taking the orders of other, cleaning and clearing away the table, manning the cash register even though there was already someone there, and serving the food to the other customers, until we were seated it and it took Andy 20 to get our order and then another 30 waiting for our food, which in my opinion is too long. Then said girl behind the cash register actually decided to help (finally) and kept mixing up our order with the other tables around us. And since she didn't realize until they finally ate it, we were forced to wait even longer. She didn't even say sorry or thank you for waiting. \n\nOverall, it wasn't a pleasant experience and the only reason I'm giving it a 2 was because Andy is so hard working and is such a rockstar and so apologetic for all the mishaps.

I chose this place because they have a website with their menu online! I'm hoping that they will add pictures to every menu item on their website so that my mom and I can let our stomachs and eyes order for us :). We called in our order and drove about 20 minutes to the restaurant. We showed up the day before their Grand Opening so we missed the restaurant when we drove down the road (they have a nice bright sign now though, so you can't miss it)! We were promptly greeted and our food was brought out right away. \n\nMy mom loves to talk so we enjoyed a fun conversation with everyone. They got us to try the melon juice and halo halo and I'm glad they did. The melon juice is like a shredded melon boba :). They add shaved ice to melon juice with shredded melon at the bottom. Super yummy- especially on a hot day. My mom and I couldn't agree on the halo halo though. I like simple halo halo while my mom loves \"loaded\" halo halo with tons of stuff (like the cup is full of beans and jellies and fruit) and D'Pinoy's halo halo is definitely more simple (maybe about a quarter full). I loved it but I'm sure my mom will ask for more fixings in hers next time. The Philippines might seem like a small country but there are many regional differences. Some people just prefer things a certain way because of the region they grew up in. \n\nWe ordered several things including lumpiang shanghai, fried bangus (milkfish), beef kaldereta, chicken curry, pancit bihon, binagoongan fried rice, and beef bulalo. I loved their pancit but my mom didn't care for the tofu in it so I took it all :). The chicken curry has bones but the chicken is very soft and will fall right off it. The beef in the beef bulalo is super soft and absolutely delicious. The binagoongan rice wasn't what I was expecting (it has mangoes and tomatoes on the side- never seen that before) but it was absolutely delicious. Very unique and very tasty! Everything was very good, very soft, and cooked very well. \n\nUnfortunately, we were missing one thing in our order and didn't notice until we got home (oops)!

It's a fast food Filipino joint that serves you up a good one or two item plate at a good price. I think some people are expecting the world by looking at some of these reviews. The food is pretty good and authentic tasting. I actually like it a lot. My favorites are the fried pork cracklins with meat attached, chicken and pork adobo and the beef steak with onions. I've been here with quite a few different people, also have been to the one at the Hawaiian market. I think the place is a hit or miss with people because of the authentic nature as compared to what you're going to get at Panda Express. I'm not a big microwave looking food eating kind of guy. I like real food that looks like it was cooked from atop a stove. I think this place grows on people, as it has on a few people I've gone with. Their reviews were so so maybe on a two star level after a first visit. But two different people, after trying it out with me a first time and being at a level two, ended up asking me if I wanted to eat at \"MY\" Filipino place. Which to me tells me both these individuals were not really at a two star rating. After a second visit I would estimate their star rating to be at a 3.5 to a 4. You kind of just have to give it a shot for yourself and don't be thrown off by the authentic look.. not all fast food joints have to cook their food in a microwave and have that rubbery consistency that a lot of people have come accustom to.\n\nOn another note, when I first use to go to Kapit.. the customer service wasn't the greatest. Now either I've been there so many times that they have warmed up to me or they have caught on that giving good service is a good business practice.. i don't know. For whatever it's worth, the food at the price was impressive enough for me to come back for more and I think if you give it a shot, you'll feel the same way. If you give it a 2 star rating, try it a second time and see if it has grown on you.

But not just any kind of shopping. Today was a day of shopping for Asian foods, beauty products and medicinal herbs. What a day! Foods, creams and spices I've never heard of. I just took it all in. When we were finished, I was definitely hungry! Right next door was Kapit Bahay. I was definitely excited to try it out as I LOVE Filipino food. \n\nWhen you walk in, you're definitely taken to a blast in the past, it seems like.  The walls were faded canary yellow, the tiling, tables and chairs were definitely outdated, to say the least. In the corner, the restaurant also doubled as a mini mart, selling snacks and goodies specific to the Philippines. The counter reminded me of a Filipino version of Panda Express. Most of the food was already prepared and lined up ready to order. The two ladies that were working the counter was a bit strange to me.  On one hand, they were super nice, but they had no patience! It was almost like I was expected to know everything and what I wanted. I felt a little rushed so I just chose the two items that I could pick out right away. \n\nFor lunch, I got the 2 choice combo for $6.50.  I'll definitely give them that.  The price is affordable and very attractive to the audience. For my choices, I got the Pork Adobo and the Lechon. Pork Adobo is a pork cooked in soy sauce, vinegar and other spices. For this choice, it tasted like the adobo was sitting out for a while.  The meat was super dry and chewy.  The broth was also way too oily for my taste, but had a nice flavor to it, not too salty. The lechon was also a turnoff for me.  Lechon is roasted pork, including the skin and fat. This lechon tasted like it was under the heat lamp for a long time.  The meat was way to hard to chew through. I ended up abandoning that side, when all said and done.\n\nAt the end of our meals, my friend and I agreed that this wasn't the best of the best. I could tell some of the choices were really authentic, however, I think they need to rotate their food a little more so we (as customers) are getting the best of what they have to offer. Living on the other side of town, the best way I can put it is that fact that I probably wouldn't make a special trip to this restaurant if ever craving Filipino food.

Want to see the interior? see the restaurant's own video on youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9ahwcj5mw&feature=mfu_in_order&list=UL \nThe atmosphere is cordial and conducive to just eating. Sometimes it's filled with diners on peak dining hours and sometimes I dine in with only 2 or three tables occupied. I like that, too, so I can concentrate on my meal and savor it without rushing out (so others can seat and eat on the table I just vacated, so unlike other restaurants). \nThere's televisions to watch Filipino programmed shows or sometimes sports is on the monitor.

Well, I stop the enumeration right there because I have many favorites. It could get on and on, including soups and desserts...that said, it would take up so much space here on this page. Any favorites you can think of? Many Filipino food favorites are presented for you to have, to taste. A variety each day. Not the same served on the buffet line everyday. Isn't that exciting? Each time you visit, it ain't the same foods for the day. \nFinely sliced, scrumptious, well-seasoned and deliciously spiced up meals. \nThey serve breakfast food. Though my regular choices were simple, my breakfast meal is always delightful of Garlic Fried Rice, a double nice sunny-side up eggs and delectable \"Longanisa\" (sweet and spicy sausage). \nAn array of finger food delicacies and packaged candies or mini-desserts for your sweet fixing need. \nFor just less than $10, a generous choice of 2 entrees in a combination with a heaping, steaming white rice and a small side of soup is a good deal. There are times I get a really good appetite, an extra serving of rice is given free of charge.\nThe buffet line staff are friendly, helpful, and cordial. And they serve with an attentive smile. Although the staff is Filipino speaking, English as you all know by now is spoken by most Filipinos.\nFood is made fresh daily, hot, and straight from the kitchen.\nA \"to-go\" styrofoam box and plastic bag is given when taking home the rest of the meal is an option.\nThere's a bathroom to wash my hands or peruse it for other purpose, you know what I mean.\nParking space is abundant outside the restaurant. Choose your space.\n\nUn-Plus, but See the Good Side Of It: \nNo wait staff if you are looking for someone to attend to you while you eat. It is a fast food restaurant. What did you expect? A tip is not even expected, unless you were really served by one of the staff. \nJust don't expect the same Filipino foods made for each day. The buffet line offers you delectable choices that varies each day. \nLater in the course of the day, the buffet trays are replenished; nevertheless, it's made fresh each time.\n\nBack to Plus: The tables are attended to after the diner(s) leave the table by a cordial cleaning attendant resulting in a nice clean table if the diners before you do not clean up after themselves, you know how some people are.\n\nOverall, I enjoy my meals and \"masarap talaga\" (that means, really tastes good!)

I know because I asked my mom, who was born and raised in the Philippines, unlike me, who was born in Akron, OH, raised in Cerritos, CA, and have parents who didn't teach me Tagalog.  Now you know, too.\n\nAs the Halo-Halo Challenge winds down, contender #9 brought us to yet another Filipino fast food place that we've never visited.  One thing Mel and I have learned in this short period of time doing the challenge is that Las Vegas has A LOT of Filipino food restaurants.  We're only going to review ten of them for this go-round, but there are still many beyond that number.  ISA is a \"turo-turo\" style place where you \"point-point\" at the food you want, just like those other places where you line up at the counter and can get two or three-item combos with rice. We didn't have any food, but I thought I'd let you know in case you want to eat here.\nWe didn't see halo-halo on the menu, but just ordered it anyway, knowing that they did offer it. The lady behind the counter starting speaking to Mel in Tagalog--uh oh.  When this happens and you don't understand what's being said, you just keep answering in English.  She got the message and finally told us that it would take ten minutes.  Oh, okay.  The price here is $5.25 for the icy dessert and theirs had:\n\nUbe ice cream, kaong, azuki, one piece of leche flan, nata de coco, white beans, jam, and chunky ice, again.  What's with the chunky ice?  Challenger #7 also had chunky ice.  I am not a fan of little icebergs in my bowl that I need to stab with my plastic spoon.  \nNo macapuno, langka, ube, or pinipig in this version.\nOther than the chunky ice, this halo-halo is not too shabby.  It's only missing a couple of ingredients that I prefer to make it one of my favorites so far.

Well, unfortunately the food DID NOT satisfy my taste buds. First let me tell you why I rated this place 3 stars, then the food we ordered and reasons why I didn't like it. \nThe 3 stars are pretty much for the great service, cleanliness and classy atmosphere. The hostess was very friendly and also pretty! (1 star for that) Servers were quite attentive and very nice whenever I was asking them questions. (2 stars for that) The third star was for a very elegant and clean look of the restaurant. \nNow, let's get down to business, the food. We ordered Max's chicken party, calamares, chicken sisig, and nilagang baka. Alright, I'll give you guys a run down for each entree. The calamares was the first food that came out after 30 minutes of WAITING, was it worth it? Nah, the batter or breading was heavy and boy it was SALLTTY! It came with sides of atchara (pickled papaya) and vinegar with garlic which helped to tame the saltiness. Second  entree the \"Max's fried chicken\" I don't know how Zankou in Cali cooks their chicken but it's incomparable. I saw someone I know that had just finished eating and he told me that KFC tasted better. I was like seriously? I had their chicken before in Glendale it's pretty good. He was right! Again, not enough seasoning and just plain salty although not as salty as the calamares but I just tasted salt. I was wondering is this what their signature fried chicken? Then just forget about it. Now the chicken sisig, I made sure I do a TIP on yelp because it was just...I really hate to say it when I talk about food, but it's gross. Not appetizing at all. Like what I tipped it's too much onions and the mayo was weird. My sister in law was like is that macaroni salad. The nilagang baka was my last hope in this entire eating experience here, but behold my freaking nilagang baka taste way better. It had a slight metal or iron taste and  don't forget the salt. Yeah, it was also a tad salty. Taste like salt water with a very hint of metal or iron. I don't know maybe I was expecting the food to be way better than those Filipino fast foods, but I can say that it's about the same.

After what seemed like an eternity and after much anticipation especially amongst the local Yelp community, Max's Las Vegas location is having a soft opening, with hours being 5:00pm to 9:00pm.  Mel C. and I stopped by for dinner on a whim and arrived around 6:30pm on a Saturday. The place was full with groups of people waiting to be seated and we were told it would be a 40 minute wait.  Already famished, but willing to be patient after waiting for so long for the place to open, we got lucky and were actually seated within 15 minutes.  However, we didn't get waited on for a while.  A waitress came by and checked on us; Mel says it's because she saw his Yelp app open, but who knows?  ;)  Although the fried chicken is what their specialty is here, I opted for the small order of kare-kare, my favorite Filipino dish.  The waitress started speaking to us in Tagalog and we answered in English until she got the gist that the b/f and I are \"Amerikano\" Filipinos, i.e. we don't speak Tagalog (although I can understand more than you think).  After a rough start, we got our food in a decent amount of time and our actual waiter, Noel, was attentive the rest of the meal.  The kare-kare beef and oxtail were good, except that the dish wasn't very hot, more lukewarm.  The eggplant was rather tough, so I didn't eat it after two bites.  Overall, there was quite a bit for a small order and I ended up taking half home. Mel got the famous fried chicken and it was just like I remember it: crispy skin like our relatives make at home, definitely not KFC like someone else described it.  \nWe didn't have room for halo-halo, but I do look forward to trying their version.  This place was busy the entire time and the line was longer for a table when we left.  It seems we weren't the only ones waiting for Max's to open and, by the looks of it, they are a big hit already.  We'll be back--salamat!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 6, "useful": 12, "cool": 9}}, {"text": "Finally!! This has been a bookmark for quite some time months before their opening.  In fact, Yelp Las Vegas even has a Talk Thread about Max's Restaurant (http://www.yelp.com/topic/north-las-vegas-halo-halo-and-maxs).  What's all the hype...it's suppose to be Filipino food at its finest.  I've had their popular crispy chicken before.  And what I can remember, it was crunchy, greasy, and yet, it was still tasty.  Fast forward to now, the chicken is still greasy, still crunchy, and still tasty.  \n\nMy Thoughts:\n-The Restaurant:  I know it's a new Restaurant and is suppose to be clean.  Guess what? It was was.  I was actually impressed with the size, decor, spaciousness, and cleanliness.  I don't remember a Max's being this clean.  Max's of Manila in Las Vegas is a change\n\n-Ambiance:  Comfortable, for me at least.  I would say it was 99.2% Filipino.  Make that 99.9% after Terri R and I arrived. It's their soft opening, so busy they were.  The mood was fast paced once you finally get your food.  As soon as you leave, they fill your vacant tables.  Lines, lines, and more lines.  Customer were coming from all over.  You even notice this from the parking lot with all the NV plates, CA plates, and rental cars. The wait for us was suppose to be 40 minutes, but we ended up being seated just 15 minutes later.  NOTE:  This can still seem like an eternity if you're hungry like a madman. \n\n-Service:  Not at their finest.  Once seated, we waited patiently, then impatiently for a long 15 minutes.  Keep in mind, this is just to get our orders taken and your drinks filled.  Max's is Filipino and their service is definitely on \"Filipino Time\".  \n\n-The Food (Max's Budget):  Like I stated earlier, their chicken hasn't changed over the years.  I ended up with their Max's Budget, which consisted of a leg quarter of Max's full chicken, 3 baby pieces of Shanghai Lumpia, a cup of white rice, and Caramel Bar.  The chicken had a lot of meat and was tasty.  The chicken was also greasy.  I use to be a fan of this type of chicken.  Not anymore.  But I can't complain about it because this is how they set for their fried chicken to taste like.  My mom's fried chicken is even made this way.  Geez, my family parties even have chicken made this way.  In other words...comfort \"Food for You\".  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=k0PIF3xHTbBa16EtRCe3yg&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ)\n\n-The Food (Max's Teaser):  I also ordered the Max's Teaser, which is their Calamari, Fries, and Shanghai Lumpia.  I don't eat fried foods much anymore and only got this to taste test.  I was disappointed with this order because it was skimped to the Max (pun intended). I felt disgusted after killing the whole plate.  Yes, I had to deMELish this but it didn't take much because I didn't get much.  I don't want to sound \"kuripot\" and I get it...it's called Max's Teaser for a reason.  They just teased me and ganked me with baby portions. (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=qm-sSyuKcJ-aYusyMZqMnQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ)\n\n-Price:  I'm mixed here because Terri's Kare Kare looked hooked up, my main meal's portion was average, and the Teaser was lacking everything.  But if you need to know, dinner for two with an appetizer only cost $33.  I guess that's not bad at all.\n\nOverall, it would take a little more for me to give this place 5 stars because they are not \"As good as it gets\".  It's also tough for me to give them less then 4 stars because Max's Las Vegas is how I remember them and exactly what they aim to be...that's comfort Filipino food and served at a \"Filipino Time\" pace.  I'm sure I will be back because my out-of-town friends and family are fans. I'm sure they'll want to come here when they visit. \n\n\nPS:  I thought the artwork on their paper place mats were a little interesting. These are just some of the things you notice when you're waiting to be served. \n\n\n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (465/500)", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 12, "useful": 14, "cool": 10}}, {"text": "I've been anxiously waiting for Max's to open since when they said they were going to open back in August.

Everyone's lolo/lola, tito/tita, ate/kuya and barkada/kaibigan were here. \n\nMy parents would take us to Max's back in Manila when I was little. I liked their chicken a lot that my mom copied their recipe and she got it right. You can't come here and not get chicken and dip it in Jufran banana ketchup.  \n\nWe got Max's Budget, Max's Fiesta Plate, calamansi juice, a bangus and halo-halo.\n\nMax's Budget:\nFried chicken leg, rice/fries, lumpiang Shanghai (egg rolls with meat) and a caramel bar. I've said this before and I'll say it again...I don't eat rice. But if I do, I always get garlic rice. The chicken was on the salty side and that's not how Max's does their chicken. My lumpia was burnt and super oily. I like the caramel bar. 3/5 \n\nMax's Fiesta Plate: \nMy sister and bro-in-law both got fried chicken leg, garlic rice, lumpiang ubod (fresh lumpia with heart of palm) and caramel bar. The lumpia wrapper was a bit thick but the filling was delicious. 4/5\n\nDaing na Bangus:\nPronounced \"dah-eeng na bang-oos\" not \"bang us\"...mmkay? Or just ask for the fried milkfish. Milkfish marinated in vinegar and garlic then fried. Dip in vinegar and eat with garlic rice. Yum! 5/5\n\nHalo-halo:\nShaved ice with kaong, nata de coco, ube, flan, beans, coconut shreds topped with ube ice cream sprinkled with pinipig. The ice to topping ratio was great. Most places will you lots of ice and less toppings. Max's has more toppings than ice and their ice is finer than the ones I've had here in Vegas. The pinipig was great and most places in Vegas  skip it and I don't know why. Sarap!!! 5/5  \n\nThere are still kinks to be worked on and I understand since it's only their soft opening. Wet plates from the washer. Our food came an hour after placing our order. The chicken was a bit saltier than other Max's I've been to. My halo-halo went to the wrong table.

The chicken was juicy and tender in the inside, and had a nice seasoned crunch on the outside.  The fresh lumpia was a nice contrast to the pallet.  The Sisig on the other hand was a bit disappointing to me because it had ears,  I guess I got too excited, and didn't fully read the description...lesson learned!  We did not get out caramel bars...but I guess that was the reason our waiter subbed out for ice cream.\n       Service from our waiter great.

In my opinion that's one long soft opening!  At this point they should consider opening normal business hours to help decrease wait time in the evening.  It was 1h+ wait time when we arrived.  They were taking \"To Go\" orders also, maybe during \"Soft Opening\" stage this isn't the smartest move; again they are only open for 4 hours ATM.

Although I did enjoy the pancit canton because they used a different type of noodle. On the other hand, the sisig was just a mess, what's up with the mayo?! It didn't have the vinegar in it like the traditional way. I read in another review it is like flop of mayo called sisig, which is true so I don't recommend ordering this. We had to wait a good 20 minutes to pay because supposedly the credit card machine was acting up, but Jackie was very apologetic about this. I must say her service did make our experience overall better. Lastly, the interior is pretty nice, beautiful for Filipino standards.

Here are my thoughts about this place:\n\n1) WAIT = The long wait was expected because of all the hype. No problem there...the only issue I had was when the host tried to give my spot in line to somebody that he knows.  When I approached him about it, he told me that he doesn't have a table for 4 yet he offered a table for 4 to his friends that just got there.\n2) AMBIANCE = the ambiance was good. Definitely a good family place to dine in.  They also have a bar inside which is a plus considering their location. It also set up nicely for private events as there are sliding doors that could separate sections of the restaurant.\n3)  SERVICE = The service wasn't as good as expected but given the fact that they just opened 8 nights ago (dinner only), I have to say that they have to do a lot of training specially their bussers. It took 15 mins before we got our drinks while there are at least 3 bussers walking around for plates to be put away instead of making sure that all the customers waiting gets their drinks first.  I finally called one of the staff which seems to be a manager or a supervisor as he wasn't wearing the waiter uniform instead he was wearing a blue shirt with a tie. I had to ask for our water and informed him that we are ready to order. After placing our order, it took another 10 mins and my husband has to asked another server for our drinks. Our waiter Lloyd apologize multiple times about the delay which is nice. He made the rest of our dining experience tolerable.\n4) FOOD = We ordered 1 full chicken, regular crispy pata, regular kare kare and bicol express and buko pandan for dessert.  The chicken was ok, I think the one in Glendale was better. The Crispy Pata was amazingly good. It was fried perfectly on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside. The Kare-Kare was also good. The Bicol Express is perfectly seasoned and spiciness hit the spot. The buko pandan was delicious but the winner for tonight's dinner was definitely the Crispy Pata.\n\nOverall, the management should consider training their staff more on quality customer service so they don't end up a failure like Goldilocks. We, Las Vegans are quite particular with the quality of service and food since we are blessed with many upscale restaurants.

We were told someone would be coming, and we waited another 10 minutes.  We had to flag someone down again.

We ended up flagging another server to find out where our server was. \n\nSo he finally comes back to attend to our needs.

He obviously was on his break smoking. Pop a breath mint or 20. I hope he at least washed his hands.

The Max's in SD closed years ago so seeing it thriving here is definitely a treat. \n\nSince I arrived here in December I have visited this place about 5 times already. I have dined in as well as phoned in pick up orders. Through my  experiences, I didn't realize that this restaurant was fairly new nor did I have any qualms about the service I received nor the quality of my food. In fact, during my last trip here, our server Lloyd was very amicable, polite, and sincere. I almost felt ashamed to hear an elder regard me with \"Po\" so obviously I tried to be an even more pleasant customer.\n\nThe nice thing is that a lot of the food here seems to be cook to order. For anyone who knows a little about cooking Filipino food, it doesn't take 5 minutes to tenderize your meat, deep fry your chicken, or soften your pancit. While I'm sure more kinks could be worked out in terms of speed, I'd much rather enjoy my food piping hot and fresh (with a 15-20 wait) than something that could easily be obtained from a \"turo-turo\" with a layer of soluble fat skimming the top.\n\nAlso, we brought some food to my family while they were visiting. Everyone knows that a homecooking 83 year old grandmother is the harshest critic of Filipino food. Needless to say, my nanay enjoyed her food very much and was surprised at the quality of the sisig and pancit. To each their own.. \n\nAnyhow, it might not quite be like home but for a family who is too lazy to cook, a transplant who wants a little taste of home, or a tourist/newcomer looking to try a different sort of Asian flare, I definitely recommend Max's. \n\nTry their garlic fried rice, fried chicken, lechon sisig, and pancit miki if you want to be a little on the safe side.

Anyways, the waiter took our orders and the food came out pretty fast. \n\nFirst was this egg drop looking soup with bits of corn, carrots and ham(?) or spam? It was an alright soup. I wasn't impressed by it since it looked like something I could have whipped up easily and maybe even better.

I'm not used to eating pancit like that and I just didn't think it was great. \n\nMax's whole chicken (4/5) - nice crispy skin, but the chicken was more on the dry side. I wasn't crazy impressed but I did think it was delicious but for the price I think I like my auntys secret recipe chicken much better. It was good just not good enough for me to come back and want more. \n\nKare-kare (2/5) - meh. It was served in a medium bowl and looked like soup with veggies. There was barely any meat and tons of sauce, soup or whatever you wanna call it. Again, this dish didn't really \"wow\" me in any way. I just used that excess sauce to pour on top of my rice. The flavor just wasn't there for me. \n\nLechon kawali (3/5) - I understand that this is deep fried but I was really turned off by the amount of oil that was just sitting on the place. And I usually LOVE lechon kawali but man that was some serious grease fest on that plate that I didn't even wanna touch it. I had like two piece but it was just insanely oily.

The other 6 items (excluding laing which was okay regarding to my family, i have no taste for it.) So for the bland foods are the following; pancit and nilaga.

We waited about 25 minutes. Not too bad you would think, but when you see the staff just standing around and empty tables you'd think they could sit you right away, but no. There were also several tables not bussed the whole time we were at the restaurant. \n\nWhen we finally were seated, we pretty much knew what we were going to order because we looked at the menu while we were waiting for our table. We had the pork sinigang,  lechon kawali,  pancit canton,  daing na bangus,  Max's chicken, large garlic fried rice and small steamed rice. We just ate family style. Everything we had was cooked well and really delicious. My only complaint about that was that the dipping sauce for the lechon kawali was ice cold. \n\nNow the service. It took us maybe 15 minutes or so before someone came to take our drink order and since we were already aware of the mediocre service we ordered our food as well. We didn't want to wait another 15 minutes to order. 30 minutes later we finally received our food. The kitchen looked busy, but there were maybe 4-5 other tables in the restaurant besides ours. I don't know why it would take that long for our food. \n\nFor dessert I got a buko pandan which I order at their restaurant when I'm in Oahu and my mom got halo halo to share with everyone.  The buko pandan didn't taste the same as the other restaurant in Oahu and wasn't the same green color. It looked really light. It wasn't as coconut tasting as expected. The halo halo was huge and my parents thought it was decent tasting. \n\nI wish they the service was better because I would go back, but I would rather not have to deal with the slow service. I really like the food here, but it's not worth my time.  Oh and by the way, the tables that had not been bussed when we arrived were still sitting there still not bussed when we left.  I don't think I'll be back unless they fix the service issue.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Excellent service.

This is a crushed ice and milk dessert with preserved fruits (beans, corn, lanka, and kaong, and topped with ube (taro) ice cream. You mix it all up and use a long spoon to eat and drink.  You can go ghetto and drink it down like a soda.  It's gross that way because you'll end up slurping to get everything in your mouth. Little kids eating it this way lose some of it on their faces, some on their shirt, and some on the floor. \n\nI also bought a small pack of mini baked rice cakes ($5) - plain and ube. My brother also ordered the fresh lumpia ($4.50) which was a rice wrapper filled with sliced pork and fresh vegetables, and topped with a warm sauce.  It's made to look like a dripping burrito but unless you scrape off the sauce, use a knife and fork. Everything we ordered was good, but the other dishes in the cafeteria style eatery was really worn down by the end of the night.\n\nI like these smaller Goldilocks locations.  The large ones in CA are sit down places have terrible service.  Often, there is no host so you end up seating yourself anyway.

I havent had this in a long time, but this is one of those that you SHOULDN'T eat on a regular. The Ube shake was good flavor, but the ice was rather too coarse for a \"shake\".

Which of course just means that we ordered nearly everything they offered: two of their two-meat plates with rice, and a bunch of other added-on take out containers of sauces and stews, plus this and that from their appetizers and desserts section, and we were out the door with a gigantic, packed bag of food for only $25.\n\nNow, I have only a vague idea of what each item was, but I can tell you right now, it was ALL freaking delicious! The pork adobo and a beef stew dish were probably my favorites, the crispy pata was too indulgent for me, the eggroll-like things (I think they're called lumpia?) were downright sinful and had surprisingly little grease, the grilled skewers of chicken and beef were both very flavorful and not overly charred or burned, and the fried intestines were super salty for my tastes- but BF loved everything that I had the slightest hesitation about.\nThere was a vegetable and shrimp crispy pancake thing that was just alright to me, but BF raved about, and I felt that way about the dessert we had- a skewer of round balls that looked like donut holes, had a chewy center, and a slight maple-syrup-like aftertaste.\n\nNot only did we pig out for this meal (as evidenced above), but there was even enough left over that we actually saved some for later- almost unheard of for us. Knowing what we like here now will likely make future trips much cheaper- two 2-meat plates with rice for under $11 is amazing, and as long as I can have pork adobo for one of those, we're good to go!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Thought I'd try a new Filipino restaurant in town, but I left very disappointed. \n\nArrived at the restaurant and was immediatley greeted by the staff.

Sweet, sticky, but nice flavors. \nginesang pusit (sauteed squid w/ chilies, and bellpepper), *- I really liked this. Right on with the flavors.\npancit (thin glass noodles),- was okay\n sisig (chopped pork with vinegar, chilies and onion), *- made with the lechon kawali, lots of chilies, added more vinegar for a kick\nginetaang baboy (pork in coconut &shrimp paste sauce), *- this was good. I love coconut milk based dishes\nlechon kawali (crispy fried or roasted pork belly), - good, crispy. Like always, big layer of fat, but at least you can pick it off it you're not a fat lover. \nlengua estofada (beef tongue slices in a tomato soy sauce)* - the tongue was really soft, but I like how they kept them in thick slices to keep it juicy inside. The sauce was good, but I scraped a lot off since I like tasting more of the lengua flavor\nafritada manok (chicken in a tomato sauce- has bellpepper, potatoes, carrot),- I didn't try\nginisang (squash, shrimps, green beans, bittermelon sautee)- grabbed only some green beans, okay\nginisang ampalaya (bittermelon sauteed with eggs)- didnt try\nseafood ginetaang (mixed seafood in coconut milk)- didnt try\ndiniguan (pork cooked in it's blood and spices)*- pretty decent for the standard style of doing diniguan. I do it in a different style which no restaurant makes and I feel is tons better\npalabok (thick rice noodles in a sortve \"gravy\" sauce)- mushy, didnt like\npork afritada (pork tomato sauce stew- has peas, potatoes, hotdog, bellpeppers)- had a small bite only, decent\nNilaga Baka (beef broth soup with chunks of beef and veggies like bokchoy, cabbage, potato)- didn't have\nkaldereta (beef stew)- pretty decent, but a bit more oily than I make it\nkare kare (oxtail, tripe, eggplants and green beans in a thick peanut sauce)- no oxtails to be found, way too oily, but the tripe was nice in it.\nbeef steak (sliced beef and onions in soy sauce)- this was okay...it was straight soy...lacking that signature sauce lemony/soy/beefy flavor \nfried salmon- didnt try\nfried bangus/milkfish*- pretty good! my favorite fish and it was fresh. \npata na paksiw (pork leg/hocks cooked in soy and banana flowers)- didnt try, I dont really like the fatty leg rims\nginetang (warm coconut milk dessert with sweet yams and tapioca)- too full to have dessert\nbanana que (bananas fried with sugar) - too full to have dessert\nfresh fruit bar- watermelon, oranges, pineapple, etc. - looked fresh\n\nThe * are some of our favorites. BF really loved the paksiw- tender and nice flavor, I love the lengua the best. \n\nThere are some extras you can buy but we were hella full to grab them. They have chicken empanadas, crispy pata (deep fried pork leg), sweets like polvoron (powdered milk \"cookie\"), pastillas (chewy milk candies), cashew tarts, tamarind candy, turon (fried banana and jackfruit \"eggroll\" cooked with a coating of sugar on the wrapper), kuchinta (steamed rice cake), pichi-pichi (rice and cassava cake rolled in grated coconut).  \n\nBTW- they are CASH ONLY. Lucky I had cash today, I normally don't roll with much more than a few bucks for tips and my cards. \n\nSimply put- compared to the Filipino a-la-carte places nearby, this is better in terms of quality and flavor and freshness (they have decent traffic so it doesn't sit forever). Add in the kicker that you can eat all you want for $7!. Some items were a miss like the palabok was mushy, but most were decent to good, spot on flavors. I can't complain since I can pick and choose what I want to eat and can skip out on the a-ok items and pig on the things I love. \n\nYes, there's a bit of fat, a bit of grease, but nothing that you can't scoop out. It's kinda part of the culture...Flipinos enjoy their fat. It's not  really more than say other greasy cuisines like diner food, chinese, soul food, etc.. It's why I don't eat out all the time though is so I can savor these when I do decide to eat something greasy and homey.  I think that's partly why MY mother's food is best to me- she tends to buy only higher end, leaner meats, but cooks with all the love and flavor. I got used to my moms health conscious, yet still flavorful Filipino, but she's no where close so I'll take something 2nd best to moms cooking....specially since I don't cook my own cultures food on a regular at home (for shame, I know and I call myself a \"cook\"). \n\nWill definitely be back!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 4, "useful": 11, "cool": 11}}, {"text": "Great price!

Really took care of us.  In addition to the free soda we got for checking in, he brought out two extra entrees...on the house.  Here is what we ordered:\n- chicken long rice- clear rice noodles with shredded chicken.  Solid.\n- original fried rice omelet- savory goodness.  The take of this classic dish wins me over.  It's their signature dish.  Order it at least once.    \n- chicken adobo- succulent chicken.  a filipino classic.  dip with a vinegar-ey sauce.\n- gisantes- a pork entree that is a little tart.  interesting. not a bad item, but we had so much incredible food, that this took longer to finish.\n- dinguan- surprisingly good.  I don't normally go for blood, but the blood was more a part of the sauce, so not a bad dish.  I'd eat it again.\n- pinakbet- pretty good.

Very good.\n- Pig Feet Lauya- I know this is a bit adventurous for some.  Please do yourself a favor and order this dish.

Hubby enjoyed the bistek and caldereta.    \n\nThe steamed rice is on the buffet in a regular steam pan and not in a large rice cooker (as most Filipino restaurants serve their steamed rice from a large rice cooker).  Prefer the steamed rice to be in a rice cooker so that it doesn't dry out.  Oh well  ...  There is also a choice of fried rice.

Of course, there is no pricing on any of the items except the halo-halo, which was listed on the board for $4.  At first I thought this was really expensive and after consulting with my wife and dad in the car, my instincts were right.  Being Filipino-American and only being able to speak in English, I felt they definitely decided to pull one over on me and overcharge.  As I was leaving, they were talking about me in Tagalog and I'm not sure exactly what they said but I laughed and they knew I understood.  So when I got home, I anonymously called and asked how much the karioka and banana que are.  They told me $1.99 for the banana que and $1.75 each for the karioka.  So the total should have been $9.50 instead of the $13 I was charged.  I immediately confronted them about the price discrepancy and the lady obviously remembered me coming in and came up with an excuse saying she charged me for a \"large\" halo-halo that cost $6 instead of $4.

When I went they had at least 20. For sure they had everything from Dinuguan, Tocino, Daing, Munggo and even Sisig (which was my favorite dish of all).\n\nThe place itself was clean. The area where the food was held was clean as well. The only thing I thought was different was the use of the trays. I know that probably served to keep the area clean and all, but I felt it just used up more room on the tables than needed to be. That part wasn't really much of a deterrent. I will come back again.\n\nMy only gripe would be the parking.

It's a great selection of savory eats and tasty treats! I really liked that I got a little taste of all of my favorite Filipino food here! There's nothing like eating a fulfilling meal of white rice topped with kare kare sauce and pairing it with pork bbq sticks!

The day I went they also offered a yummy Filipino dessert via ginataang totong (coconut dessert with mung beans). The ginataang totong was sweet and very good. It is like eating rice pudding.\n\nThe buffet here is $7.99. You can pay another $1.50 for the soda.\nThey also offer other treats here for an extra price like turon (banana eggroll), 3 for $2 and Filipino ice cream popsicles and ice cream drumsticks, $1.50-$1.99 each.

A combo plate of these two items also came with rice and achara (pickled papaya and carrots).  I also ordered one piece of saba at langka [saba bananas (or in this case, plantains) and jackfruit, wrapped in lumpia wrapper and deep-fried].\n\nThe wait for our food took longer than I expected, but it wasn't too much of an issue since Mom took awhile to do the groceries.  The wait, however, was worth it!  I really enjoyed the pork barbecue skewers- the flavors really took me back to my childhood in the Philippines, when street food, already a daily ritual for us then (and just now gaining popularity stateside) had us sampling BBQ, fried fishballs (and the many different sauces to dip them in!), steamed rolled rice and tuber pancakes, ripe and sour mangoes (the latter eaten with bagoong (very tiny salted shrimp) or vinegar and garlic, and \"dirty\" ice cream, to name a few from food carts that were to be seen all over Metro Manila and around colleges (grammar schools) and universities (\"colleges\" here).  Writing about those pork skewers actually make me want to stop at Mekong Plaza now, instead of going for Italian or French food I was considering earlier!  The liempo, on the other hand, I could've gone without; I remember thinking that we should've just ordered a double of the BBQ!  The skewers were just more flavorful than the pork belly pieces.  While Mom enjoyed the liempo, she did agree that the BBQ was were the money was at, and the owners really did have something to be proud of!\n\nLet's not forget the dessert!  On second thought, maybe we should.  First, I didn't care for the presentation.  Take a gander at the photos, and you'll see what I mean.  Second, it wasn't very sweet.  Not even sweet enough.  See that pool of caramel sauce the turon rested on?  I did not leave a single drop on the plate!  Not because it was so delicious, but because the roll really needed the added punch.  Mom already knew it wasn't going to be anything to write home about, just by looking at the offering, but did wait till I took a couple of bites before saying \"I should've just bought the ingredients at Mekong and made you those at home!\"  My sentiments exactly, Mommy dearest!\n\nOh, but the pork BBQ!

When I went to pay I decided to splurge and get an order of Pancit, another favorite, to go for later or the next day. \n\nIt was closing time but the food was still coming out of the kitchen for late customers and it, too, smelled good.  Must. Come. Back.\n\nParking is no problem.  There is a huge lot.  And as of this writing, 11/16/12, their hours are 8am to 8pm seven days a week.  I asked and was told they had just opened up about a month ago.  They offer many more items besides the buffet choices including Lumpia, Pancit, and silog, which I understand is a breakfast type plate including fried rice with your choice of meat (beef, pork, chicken, fish) and a couple of sunny side up eggs, available all day.

We ventured in here eager to try out this restaurant for lunch, and left full and satisfied.  The owners here were warm and friendly, and at the \"buffet\" area there were about 8 items for people to choose from.  In addition to single dishes, they offer combo meals (2 items for 5.99, $1.50 for each extra item), and if there's something on the menu like lechon kawali (Deep fried pork belly) that you don't see in the buffet, chances are they'll be able to make some for you on the spot.  My friend and I shared a 3 item and 2 item combo. We got a good mix of dishes, such as fried fish, dinuguan (stewed pork), lechon kawali, chicken curry, and stewed jackfruit in coconut milk.  Each dish had very good, rich flavor, and came with a hefty side of rice.  Out of all the dishes, I was most impressed with the dinuguan.  It's basically a stewed pork dish made with pork blood and spices.  This is my first time trying this dish, and despite the sanguine origins, it was really tasty.  I couldn't taste any particular \"blood\" flavor per se (Due to the spices and other ingredients to enhance the sauce), and the pork in the sauce was nice and tender.  \n\nThere are 2 fridges with various drinks, like bottled water, Coke products, and some more Asian drinks such as calamansi juice and coconut juice.  As for ambiance, it's basically a little hole-in-the-wall, mom-and-pop restaurant.  \n\nDue to the reasonable prices, very friendly service, and homemade dishes made with expertise and care, this is definitely a place I'd like to go to again!", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 6, "cool": 4}}, {"text": "Longanisa with vinegar dip, fried rice and egg is the bomb!", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I love their pinakbet (veggies sauteed in garlic and salted shrimp paste) and their pork BBQ (the meat is marinated in soy and garlic, skewered, then grilled).

I've tried a number of Filipino restaurants from Mesa to Glendale and Manila Sunrise was hands down THE BEST. No offense Arizona but this is the first Filipino restaurant that was as good as California. First of all the service was amazing! I felt like the staff was my Tita's (auntie) house and she was taking care of us like we were her relatives. I didn't catch her name but she was so cute in her chef's hat and she was super sassy, I love it. The food, oh my god, the food was amazing. I have been craving Filipino food for a while now, so I decided to go all out for this particular lunch. I ordered us the crispy pata, which is a traditional dish that is basically the best ever invented. If you like lechon, which is the roasted pig, this is the way to go. It was cooked to perfection with the crispiest skin and most tender meat. This was the husband first time eating crispy pata and it had him (and me) tearing it apart for every last bit of meat. Since that took about 20 minutes to cook (so worth it) we decided to share a combo plate while we waited. We got the fish sinigang and kare kare- I must say both were extremely delicious, but I'd say the kare kare stood out over the sinigang. Sinigang is a tamarind based soup, so it's sour (in the best way) and kare kare is a special stew with a peanut based sauce that is to die for with some rice and bagaon (shrimp paste). Randomly, I ran into my brother and some of his friends here, so I expect to see some familiar Filipino faces everytime I come back. I can't wait! I love Manila Sunrise!

I've been reading pretty good reviews about this place, so I took my parents for a quick bite to eat while running errands. \n\nManilla Sunrise Gourmet is tucked away in a shopping plaza in West Mesa. It's a small, but cute establishment. When we walked in it was a little crowded, so we were thinking the food must be good. After reviewing the menu we noticed they didn't have to much to choose from. The food under the hot lamp looked a little \"old.\" We ordered 4 different things; Picadillo (Giniling), BBQ Pork, Ribs and Shanghai Lumpia. All left us disappointed and still hungry!! =( The Giniling was oily and the ground beef tasted raw. As for the BBQ and Ribs, it seemed as if they just came straight from the grocery store freezer, no real flavor at all. Also the ribs seemed to have a coating of oil on them. I figured the Lumpia would be better. Who can really mess up lumpia, even if it was store bought?!! Well they managed to mess it up anyway and burned it. As for the rice, it was soggy. To top it off we happened to get some of the \"morning\" rice and new rice mixed together... Blahhhhh!! \n\nI heard they have great dessert, Halo Halo and Turon but after my experience with the food we decided to just skip it. It seems there are NO GOOD FILIPINO places on this side of town!!
