There is a restaurant which seems to do pretty good business. I popped in before 7 on a Friday for a takeaway and it was pretty full which is always a good sign, with lots of other popping in to collect takeaway too.\n\nTheir takeaways are awesome. First visit at New Years was for meal deal for 2 and we added extra bits (pakora, naan, extra rice) on to make it a meal for 3 - seriously, there was tons of food, even feeding three with pub munchies, meant there was still another meal and a bit left for another day. Meat is cooked amazingly - we had a chicken korma and there was a lamb dish with mint whose name escapes me. I would never order lamb normally and didn't intend on even trying it but it was awesome. Totally melt in the mouth gorgeousness. \n\nI tried to look for it last night but probably missed it on the menu due to tiredness and starvation so I opted for a chicken dupiaza. It was lovely, subtly spiced tomatoey sauce with huge chunks of tender chicken and slices of red and green peppers and onions - yum! I ordered boiled rice to go with it and when I opened the bag at home, not only did I have my order, but a 2 little tubs containing a chopped onion salad and some mango chutney. I think this is a Jashans thing as there is always some kind of salad and sauce thing that comes extra which is a nice touch. \n\nSo, yep, Jashans is worth checking out. There are deals on for the restaurant on Sundays, and lunchtimes during the week,if you fancy a bargain lunch treat. The staff are lovely and the restaurant is really nicely decorated, very modern, but with lots of red, orange and gold accents to reflect the Indian and Bangladeshi theme.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I was really happy to see a curry house open on Slateford road, in part it always struck me as odd that there are 4 (now 5 I think) Chinese style takeaways or restaurants yet no Indian...\n\nHowever Jashans is a mixed bag, I can't fault the quality of the meat and the milder curries are decent however the spicier dishes lack any differentiation outside of an extra chopped chili or some chunks of garlic, they all use the same base sauce giving no depth to the flavour. Perhaps the demand simply isn't there for the spicier dishes and thus when one is ordered it is an exception, however this doesn't excuse that it  feels like there is a lack of care in these dishes.\n\nJashans is ideal for those that enjoy milder curries, but if you are looking for something a little hotter (madras or similar) there are definitely better places.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "it was sunday night, it was late, it was cold, it had been snowing on and off all weekend, neither me or my boyfriend could face cooking dinner so we decided to finally try jashans which had opened up down the street from his flat a number of months ago.  we phoned our order in and headed over to pick it up.\n\ni was a bit shocked entering the restaurant itself, as it really rather quite posh looking.  all rich sumptious colours and dark wooden tables.  i was definitely impressed, perhaps less so when we had at least three different waiters come up to us to ask what our take away order was.  um we already ordered and we are just waiting for the food now... it also took about three attempts to pay.  about 10 minutes after our arrival though, we had paid and the food was brought to us and we hopped in the car to head home.\n\ni unpacked the items which included poppadums, onion salad, garlic chicken, green herb chicken, saag aloo, pilau rice, and a peshwari naan.  i did like that the food came in tupperwares which meant for less chance of an accidental spillage while carrying it from car to flat, but i found that the food was barely on the hot side, more warm moving to room temperature.\n\nto be fair the curries were perfectly nice and i really enjoyed the naan, it was lovely and coconuty and sweet but without that weird hideous orange dyed coconut colour that you usually get.  but i felt like this place fell short of the other amazing curry houses that edinburgh has to offer as i can really only describe my meal as nice and not overly memorable.  it was also a bit more expensive than i would have expected for a takeaway.  so sadly, it's only A-OK and i may encourage my boyfriend to order from a different establishment the next time we opt for an indian to take away.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Awesome banquet meal! \u00a312 each every Sunday.

The food and service was brilliant! \n\nThe Britannia Spice Restaurant is situated just on the corner of Commercial Street. When inside, the restaurant is quite spacious and its interior certainly is influenced by the nautical history of Leith, with ships galore, memorabilia on the walls and it even has a ship's wheel! \n\nSo, you're satisfied by the decor, but what about the food? Well, the food certainly beats the decor am afraid. The portions are generous and we did not have to wait long to get our starters and then our main courses. The starters were tasty with the pakora and samosas going down a treat! The tikka masala and jaipuri were bursting full of flavours, while the nan bread was ideal. \n\nThe service was top notch even though the restaurant was quite busy, not full, but still busy enough to keep the staff on their toes. \n\nA great place to eat in Leith!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "This classy Indian restaurant has a great reputation throughout Edinburgh for better than average cuisine of a spicy nature, so after a strenuous (!) afternoon of shopping at the nearby Ocean Terminal shopping centre, my mother and I decided this was definitely the moment for a curry with matching, tasty nan bread.\n\nAs my mother and I are both pretty indecisive people when it comes to choosing anything from a menu that has more than one thing on it, the helpful waiter chap recommended quite a few dishes for us. We went for the Murgh Masallam and actually, I think the other dish was a good old Tikka Masala, which I know is a pretty unadventurous dish to go for, but it tasted so good. Add some garlic nan bread and pilau rice, and you have yourself one awesome meal.\n\nAptly, being near the water and the Royal Yacht Britania, the restaurant's interior is very nautical, with a lot of blue and sail decoration on the go, so you do feel like you could be eating in someone's large yacht. I should also add that not only does Britannia Spice offer Indian food, it also has a range of Bangladeshi, Nepali and Thai cuisine on the menu.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Britannia Spice is the place to come for Indian food that is definitely a cut above your average curry house, at above average prices as well.  When I came with some friends we were well impressed by our meals, and found that although the menu boasted a bewildering array of different dishes, of the selection we tried everything was extremely tasty, indicating that they've not been over-ambitious in offering food from such varied geographical areas, from Nepal to Thailand.\n\nHowever, somehow I can't recommend the atmosphere of this large restaurant, perhaps because, with its nautical theme, it's so overtly aimed at tourists who've just visited the nearby Royal Yacht Britannia.  I kind of felt sorry for the waiters for having to wear absurd sailor costumes, while the overall vibe is of an astute money-making franchise rather than of a friendly family-run business.\n\nThe quality of food just about makes up for this defect though.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Generally, there are two (mutually exclusive) indications that a restaurant's food is not going to be that great: an over-the-top theme, and location within walking distance of a major tourist attraction.

I also love that dishes can be ordered in both side-dish and entree portions, which lets individual diners have some variety if dining alone or in a group that's not eating family-style (shared dishes). \n\nMy partner and I especially liked the Mushroom Bhajee and Mughlai Vegetables. Service was a little formal and stiff for my tastes, but the servers are very kind and try extra hard to ensure a nice dining experience.

The food, while pleasant (more than pleasant)... I just don't remember thinking I was blown away. I had the prawn puri, a nice touch in that you could see what ingredients were involved whereas in some restaurants it's a smooth sauce with an odd colour to it (not that the colour detracts), and it was a generous portion of prawns inside the puri. The Silent Reviewer had the mixed kebabs, which he greatly enjoyed. \n\nMy main was a huge selection of tandoori vegetables - with a little kick at the end. I don't usually pick the tandoori option, but I didn't feel particularly overawed by the vegetables - grilled vegetables are lovely, but the marinade hadn't infused the vegetables, just sort of slid into any nook or cranny available (bit hard on a tomato). We also shared a side of chana masala, it seems the Silent Reviewer is picking up my little love of chickpeas, as well as a garlic naan and some rice. We definitely had leftovers! I keep wanting to use the word pleasant, because it was and if it wasn't for the service, I may have been more inclined to go back. The Silent Reviewer certainly wants to. \n\nNow the problem I have is that from the moment we sat down, any question was directed to the Silent Reviewer. 'Are you ready to order drinks, Sir', 'Are you ready to order now, Sir'. Apart from pulling out a chair for me to sit down, I felt like I had turned into the Silent Diner. When the check came, it was placed on the table then moved to a jaunty angle, in order to face 'Sir'. \n\nToo bad Madam was paying. \n\nNow, I'm all for manners and being polite, but I didn't feel it was polite, I felt slighted, as the only time I was acknowledged was at the end of the meal when I walked out and the door was opened for me (subsequently for the Silent Reviewer as well). Especially as I was actually paying for the meal, I would have preferred the service we had from the gentlemen at Britannia Spice to have checked rather than assume that the male of the party was paying. It left me fuming in all of my feminist glory. For that, I don't want to go back and it will take some effort for the Silent Reviewer to persuade me otherwise.
