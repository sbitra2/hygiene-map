I thought 45 dollars was a great price for a generous 2.5 pd lobster entree.\nWhat arrived on my plate was a cut up overly sauced jigsawed puzzled lobster animation on a platter which was in no way a 2.5 pound creature to begin with. It was dismantled then pieced together to look like a lobster shape. The meat was still in shell. (and I mean IN SHELL).  There was hardly any meat to be had. The tail which should have been the meatiest portion was cut in one inch pieces with shell INTACT and had yielded maybe 2 morsel of meat total.

The chicken is good as well - not some of the gray chicken-like material found at lesser establishments.  \n\nWe don't dine in often or at all.

The portions they give out are very fair - my cashew chicken typically leaves me with a nice lunch for work the next day. \n\nIf you're looking for top-quality Chinese food, I highly recommend getting take-out here.

The decor is neither unique nor offensive, jumping on the current generic steakhouse decor with the bar having the alcohol bottles on under-lit glass shelves behind it and the main dining part of the restaurant dimly lit with dark wood wainscoting and blood orange red walls. Flowers and vases stuck to that deep red and orange theme as well. \n\nI ordered nearly immediately. A petite (8 oz.)

Maybe the overcooking is why it took 45 minutes?!? No trace of anything even remotely pink in the middle. I immediately pointed it out to my waitress and she agreed and apologized once again.

While I can't fault the service, if you are a steakhouse and you can't get the cook level on your steaks done correctly (and in a timely fashion) you need to fire someone in the kitchen and find someone who can...especially when you are charging $30-40 per steak and the place is nearly empty.\n\nConsidering the price (over $50 w/tip and w/out wine), if I make it back to Madison I'm taking my future business to Tornado Steak House.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 5, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Decided to go here for Restaurant Week and was not disappointed.

It was OK.  We were in Madison this past weekend for our 1st Anniversary and I really needed to find a place the first night that I could make reservations at seeing we were dining with our 7-month-old daughter - weren't sure how she was going to handle a long dinner out -  and I also needed a place that well, makes a damn good steak.  I figured it was safe to assume that something with Chophouse in the name would make a decent filet.  \n\nThings started off very promising.  Our server, Liz, was incredibly nice and was wonderfully sweet to us and our little girl.  She was very apologetic when it took a ridiculous amount of time to receive our first course - carpaccio and she even removed it from our bill.   She was great and she is the reason for one of the stars.  Finally after the carpaccio - which was quite delicious, not overly flavorful or brilliant, but good enough - we received our Caesar salads which were actually brilliant and delicious and receive star number two.   Though, in a \"chophouse\" a salad should NOT be the highlight of our meal.  FINALLY, our steak comes out.  We both ordered a filet done medium rare and while their level of doneness was not an issue, it was just the most absolute boring filet I've ever spent $38 on.  It was completely unseasoned and looked like it came off a Weber grill out back.  Scratch that, a filet off a Weber grill out back would have been far more delicious.  I was expecting something far more luxurious - a nice solid sear, etc.  This did not meet either of our expectations at all.   We went with the a side of mushrooms and they were pretty good.  By no means the best damn mushrooms I've ever eaten, but they were pretty good.  All in all, this place was a big miss for us and left a bit disappointed.  I kept saying we should just got to Ruth Chris', take our daughter to a chain, it'd be easier, this and that and dammit - we should have.  \n\nWe certainly wouldn't make any effort to go back here, nor would we recommend it to anyone else.
