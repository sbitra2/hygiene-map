They had pakora's but I don't want vegetables battered and fried. (I'll eat my calories at Hagen Daaz thank you.)  My eating partner had the chicken boti which comes a la carte but they added about a half a cup of rice as a bonus.  Very nice.  We had the roti which was puffy but nothing to write home about.  I had a beef dish (can't remember name)  that consisted of a piece of beef with a sauce that seemed to have file(fee-lay) powder in it --the stuff they use in New orleans to thicken Gumbo.  First, I had to scoop out about 8 tablespoons of oil from the top of the dish onto another dish.  I spent some time doing this so much so that the owner realized what I was doing.  He politely assured me that it was only vegetable oil (as opposed to butter, I guess). I told him that I really didn't want the calories of the oil (also concerned about stomach's reaction to so much fat, but I didn't say this to him).  So all in all, my eating partner had an average meal and I ending up packing the meal and frankly I don't know what I am going to do with it.  By the way, they served a very tasty hot sauce which is house made.  As I said before, the owner/server could not have been nicer.  I was so disappointed considering I adore this type cuisine.

I asked for an order of Indian pickles and chutneys...they told me we already had them and pointed to the sauces on the table...uhhhh, ok, chutney is pretty universal (although some can be very exotic but I digress) and that was not chutney.  Next up- all of the dishes were bland and very sweet like they had been made with canned tomato sauce (or ketchup). I asked for my food very spicy and they said that the food could only be prepared as it was (aka all the food is pre-cooked and they are just reheating it).  So I asked for some hot pickle or hot sauce.  They brought some ketchupy looking stuff and warned me that it was very hot....it tasted like ketchup with a half drop of Tabasco in it.

But hey, what's life if you don't take a risk now and then?\n\nWell, I'm kind of glad we did. The place itself is rather spacious and very comfortable, with low lighting (they bring up the lights a little brighter over an occupied table, which is quite snazzy) - altogether quite pleasing, especially on a cold, rainy December night. One touch that really doesn't work, though, is a large digital clock with red numbers - even counting the seconds - which \"chimes\" the hour every 30 minutes. It's a little disruptive, not to mention slightly apocalyptic.\n\nNow then, when it comes to curries, I love chicken korma. I mean I really love it. I don't choose it because I can't handle spice (I can) or because I don't like the unfamiliar (I do) but just because I really, really love it. But normally, I feel cowed, worried that I will be judged as a pleb, so I order something else instead. Of course, I always enjoy my food; I don't order to spite myself. However, sometimes I just long for that creamy rich korma... Well, this was the day! Defiantly, I decided to navigate with determination to the korma, through an impressively extensive menu - the second half of the menu is Indian; the first half, it claims, is Thai - I'm no expert in Thai so can't comment on the remarks in previous reviews that it lacks authenticity. Moray L was certainly looking forward to her meal at least, having eaten there before, and promising me that the sweet potato fritters were \"the best thing ever!\"\n\nThe sauces that arrived with our poppodums were a little lacklustre and I think they might have come out of bottles, but they were fine. Our waiter, on the other hand, did not seem fine. I don't know whether he'd just had some terrible news, or was just having a really bad day, but he walked everywhere at half speed like he'd rather be anywhere else and never cracked a smile once. It wasn't busy in there (about three or four tables including us), but it seemed to take forever to get anything done and after our first drinks he didn't come back to offer us more at any point.\n\nMoray was right, by the way: those fritters really are quite something. As I said, I can't vouch for their Thai authenticity but I don't really care. I just want to eat them all. My korma, too, was lovely - perhaps there wasn't as much as I might have hoped for, but maybe I've been spoiled in the past. It was just fine - not the best I've had, but not disappointing either, and hit the spot nicely. I'd ordered lemon rice to go with it, and it was super-lemony (hooray!), which gave a nice kick to the creaminess of the korma.\n\nOur bill came to just under \u00a340 and, well, here's a useful thing - if you're going Dutch, they handily present the total per person (as divided equally) beneath the main total. Assuming you've ordered roughly the same amount, this means no more faffing around working it out!\n\nIt feels like more than three stars, it really does, but just doesn't quite warrant four.

As I go to fill up my plate, I (and the entire restaurant) hear her yelling into the kitchen and the tone was not friendly.  Someone yells back, also not in friendly or joking tones.\n\nNow, I look at the items in the buffet, and it looks pretty sparse.  Granted, the place hadn't just opened, it was after 1.  But still.  Rice, a chicken korma, a spinach dish, a vegetarian dish, maybe two sad pieces of tandoori chicken, no onions or lemon with in.

The BF asked what my favorite dish was, and I didn't have an immediate response to this question, one bit. \n\nFood was great, I really liked the flavors.

The place was almost deserted at 1pm, with only one other table occupied - fair enough. We went for the buffet. And I have to say, it was simply \"okay\". The buffet didn't have a particularly wide variety of stuff - several items were cheap regulars such as the saag and the dhal - spinach and lentils for the uninitiated. They did have aloo zucchini, never seen that before - tasted okay, about as good as I'd have been able to make it (and that's actually not a compliment). No lamb dishes - disappointing, but unfortunately this is also rare.\n\nFlavorwise, I found it boring and unspectacular. Saag is saag, tandoori chicken is tandoori chicken, except their chicken was very light on the tandoori smoke flavour. None of the food left the slight zing on my tongue that it should have. Rice was okay, but then you typically can't go wrong with cooking basmati (although another reviewer's mileage apparently differed on this count). We had our almost-3-year-old along and he did have a little rice, chicken and beef - it was his first real curry and thus a pretty substantial milestone for us. Then the wife went to get a little kheer and a gulab jamun ball. The kheer was watery but tasted okay - compared unfavourably to the sabudaana kheer at India Palace. The jamun ball was almost completely solid - you had to press real hard with a fork to cut it, normally they're nice and soft and soaked. However, another one I got was normal - so it was just the luck of the draw there. Beef curry was nice, although the first piece I ate was mainly fat - whatever, you get that and I don't mind it. The fried pakoras can normally be cut through with a fork. These you had to saw through with a knife - not great, chewy to the point of almost being crunchy. No samosas in the buffet. The naan was unusual. I've had a LOT of naan before and this stuff was the uncommon kind, not thick and pita-ey but instead a little more like a roti. It tasted very fresh - we had plain and also garlic - and the wife really liked it. Kid did too. I personally prefer the other sort of naan - softer and a little more substance to it, but this one had merit regardless. However, it took at least fifteen minutes after our food was served before the naan arrived.\n\nAll up, middle of the road as far as I'm concerned, although the wife quite liked it. Note that this is for the buffet only - we did not have a-la-carte and perhaps the to-order cooked food may have tasted better. I've had better buffets - the best one in Phoenix west of the 17 IMO is India Palace - a wider variety, a lot busier (as a result, I'm sure) and more flavourful food. Admittedly, I haven't tried any other Indian places south of Bell but west of the 17 except for Sutra. Bell appears to have most of them?\n\nI would normally have given this place a flat three stars, but I'm going to give it an extra half and round up for a few reasons. Firstly, the waiter was real nice and very attentive - up to the standard of a typical US chain place, rather than the silent wanderers with the Easter Island statue facial expressions at other buffets who do no more than refill your water and clear your dirty dishes every fifteen minutes or so. He was asking us how we were doing, offered refills of my wife's iced tea at appropriate times etc. Spot on. Next, there's a buffet discount where all kids under 10 are $5 - however, we noticed that they appropriately knocked the price down to $3.50 for us, unbidden and I guess for the simple reason that he was set up in a high chair and obviously only ate 1/4 of a breakfast bowl worth of food in total. Third, the place had nice decor (although I was a bit concerned there were no tablecloths, with my kid banging his plastic sippy cup and spilling sh1t all over the tabletop) and thankfully they didn't have sh1tapple wudda-wudda-waa-waa pretentious bhangra muzak playing in a cheap attempt at making you feel like you're actually in India.\n\nI'd eat here again, but only if I'm in the area and DYING for Indian food. It simply didn't measure up, either buffet-wise or flavour-wise. For first-timers, I can see how they would have enjoyed the experience - clean seating area, Americanized flavours and a good waiter.

Seriously. It was a very thin sauce, with cut up chunks of nicely cooked chicken breast in it. But the sauce was not like any shahikorma I've ever had, and it was not interesting. The second time we came we had the Chicken Tikka Masala, and strangely enough, it had the exact same sauce as the shahikorma. The two dishes should not, repeat not, have the same sauce. And the Chicken Tikka should have been made with chicken cooked in the Tandoor oven, but there was no evidence that it had been. We felt a little ripped off that the two dishes use the same sauce. They should not. \n\nThe spinach dishes were ok, except the potatoes in the Spinach Aloo were undercooked - as in crunchy. I didn't eat them. \n\nThe Naan is great, I admit.

I'm not someone that loves spicy food (ie. Hyderabi, Goan, Pakistani food.. I can't handle you) However, I do like some heat, so the 3 was honestly just perfect for my mom, sister and myself.

My friend and I went here for dinner after work on a Thursday about 2 weeks after opening and were very excited to come here after seeing the restaurant's tuk tuks wandering the streets. First of all, it's a great location in the heart of tollcross, across from King's Theatre and conveniently next to a co-op when you want to take advantage of Tuk Tuk's BYOB policy. The branding they've developed is very smart and makes it look like it's part of a chain. After asking one of the waitstaff who is a school friend of the owner, he said they hope to eventually expand in this way. The interior is very stylish but also has an old building charm. We only discovered upon visiting the toilets that the building must have used to be a bank, as there's a huge vault door in the ladies'! The music was also very fun, who doesn't love a bit of bollywood?\n\nThe major problem with our visit was the wait for the food. We were seated immediately when we arrived, but because there was a large group that had sat down not long before us, the kitchen had a hard time dealing with the number of orders. Our server continually apologised for the delay and even brought out complementary poppadoms when we asked for something because we were starving after waiting for such a long time. I would think that once they have their service down, they would aim to bring out the tapas style dishes as they're ready, but we mostly got ours all at once as in a normal restaurant. The food was good. Each dish came in a perfect portion size considering one person is recommended to order 2-3 dishes. There was this mysterious sauce that seemed to appear drizzled on most of the dishes; my friend didn't much care for it but it wasn't listed on the menu so she didn't know not to ask for it. The dishes also came in these small metal dishes that, while stylish, were very hot to the touch! It made it difficult if you wanted to pour a curry over rice or to pass a dish over the table to someone. At the end of the meal, though, the bill was surprisingly affordable for the amount we ordered, though at that time they could only take cash as payment. Luckily, it's located right next to the co-op! I plan on going back here because I think they have a lot of potential and room to improve on this one experience.

They're making money hand-over-dot at this place and the final issue I have is that my 8-oz container of chicken makhani was less than half chicken and the rest sauce. See my Tandoori Village review for more information on this. They need to knock their prices WAY down. I want a take-out meal for two and I want it to be under thirty bucks. When I can get three pounds of Chinese food for under $20 (see my review of Chen & Wok in Surprise), paying double that for less food doesn't strike me as a particularly good deal. Don't anyone make the mistake that this place is haute cuisine either. It ain't Gaylords. Not by a long shot.

For most Indian restaurants, the trend is to put out large tubs of curries and tandoori chicken made with ready-made pastes.  With pre-made pastes, it is impossible to get a fantastic Indian meal, it must be made with fresh ingredients, from scratch (even down to making your own cheese).  It got to the point that I could not scratch that itch for the authentic tasting stuff so I started making it on my own at home.  Just like Mexican food, the best stuff is made at home, not in the restaurants.  \n  \nHowever, the Tandoori Times bistro came along in Scottsdale and I had finally found my culinary nirvana.  Then as if prayers were being answered, Tandoori Times 2 came to Glendale.  Their tandoori chicken is exactly as I remembered it at Modhi Mahal's in Delhi, as is the dal, nan, mattar paneer.  \n  \nI've read a lot of mixed reviews of TT2 here on Yelp ranging from \"beyond bad\" to exquisite.  I don't understand this, maybe because most Americans don't know what to expect with Indian food because they either think it's native American food or they've never had it in their life before (most Americans already know Mexican food, whether they like it or not).  One thing about food from India, is that it is an ancient cuisine going back thousands of years.  Mexican food as we know it (tacos, enchiladas, tostadas etc.) is relatively new.  Why is this important to know?  Well, even the rice is different, basmati rice has been developed for thousands of years to get the size of grain and taste:  they CARE about what grain of rice they use, it has to be basmati (Uncle Joe's Brown rice just isn't the same, sorry).  This is the feeling I get from TT2, they know what authentic Indian food is and what it takes to make it and it is no trivial, slap-a-burger-on-the-grill-and-fry-it type of food.  It takes days of preparation to put out the correct recipe and it doesn't come from canned pastes.  \n  \nThis really shows up in the end result at Tandoori Times 2 and makes their somewhat high priced menu worth it if you know what really goes into making good cuisine of India.

Sign says \"Please wait to be seated.\" So we wait, and wait, and wait. A few waitresses made eye contact with us, but no on really bothered coming over to welcome us. There were a couple open tables and I could have sat myself, but you know, in a new place you want to play by the rules as much as possible - so we kept waiting. After about 5 minutes a young lady came over and asked if we'd like to sit in the open table less than 5 feet away. \"Yes please.\" I responded. \n\nAfter sitting at an empty table for about 7 more minutes, we still had yet to be given our menus, silverware, or even a cup of water. At this point I wanted to leave, because frankly I wasn't having the best time. \n\nFortunately our waters and menus arrived, after being in their doors for about 15 minutes. \n\nGuess what happened next? If you guessed more waiting, you're right. We say at our table with empty bellies and waters in hand, for about 10 more minutes before our waitress returned. She asked if we were ready to order - I wasn't sure if she meant drinks or food. Fortunately my girlfriend was quick enough to position that we were ready with our whole order.\n\nWe ordered a couple soft drinks and all of our food, at this point I think our waitress recognized that we were a bit annoyed by our wait, and promptly returned with our soft drinks. Props to her for some mediocre situational awareness skills. \n\nOur food came out maybe 10 minutes after we ordered it. Things are looking up! Or so I thought...\n\nAbout 5 minutes into eating, really loud hookah bar music started pumping through the speaker, then she appeared. The belly dancer. Now I've never seen a real live authentic belly dancer before, so I had pretty unestablished expectations...I was a clean slate. To be as un rude as possible about her appearance - It wasn't the most appetizing thing to watch while eating, frankly I wanted to tip her so that she wasn't dancing in the faces of my date and I but I think tipping would be giving her false signals, such as I enjoyed her presence. \n\nI feel like tipping a dancer, strip club style and having her stuff it in her garments somehow, is not what should be happening while eating dinner. Unless I'm having the steak special at HiLiter.\n\nAfter not finishing all the food, because I had lost my appetite, we got the check, paid and left. \n\nNow I know what Tandoori Times is like. \n\nI really think they could benefit from nixing the belly dancer from the payroll and investing in a hostess instead. \n\nI'm giving it two stars, as my girlfriend was amused by my attitude about the place throughout the evening, and the food wasn't even bad!

We went on a Thursday night and walked in with a Groupon which they readily accepted.\n\nOne of the positives is that they have a full bar and a very nice wine list which my wife appreciates.  I like the full bar in case I want an old fashioned as I'm not much of a wine drinker.\n\nI ordered the lamb vindaloo and the Princess ordered the chicken vindaloo.

We buy it at Costco just to have around the house.  The naan here is a whole different level than what I pull out of that bag, let me tell you!  Soft, light, and perfectly toasted.  We upgraded to the chili naan which has green chilies sprinkled all over it.  It's awesome, definitely worth the next $1 or whatever it is.\n\nFinished the meal with dessert, (surprise, surprise).

Since trying a dosa last year, then exploring some of the hotter dishes from the region, and choosing from the overabundance of Indian restaurants in Edinburgh, when I heard The Cholas had opened also offering dosas, I made a booking as soon as I could.\n\nAnd what I found wasn't just dosas, but lidls, and lots of other puffy bread products, and curries made the proper way - with chunks of spinach and simmered down lentils and still firm chickpeas, and each curry tasting entirely different to the last.\n\nEven their drinks are homemade: the Cholas special, a tonic water with lime and mint concoction, incredibly refreshing. Then the lemon and ginger tea I ordered at the end being another home-made beauty. The Chai Latte is also made in house. The fact that The Cholas make everything themselves, and there isn't a Twinings teabag label in sight, really made me happy.\n\nBut the biggest happiness came from the food. So many Indian restaurants in Edinburgh, so many doing nice food that really is tasty. But here you'll fine coconut rice with mustard seeds, coconut flakes and almonds; or lemon rice with kaffir leaves and curry leaves and peanuts; or a Daal curry with whole chickpeas; or a chicken starter with a delicious dopiaza style onion sauce. The curries were hardly 'saucy' at all, as is often the case: big bowls of creamy, liquid sauce with chunks of meat. Oh no, these were mainly the ingredients - whether it was spinach and lentils, or chicken or chickpeas - being the centre of the dish, with hardly any extra, redundant, filler 'sauce'.\n\nI didn't even try a dosa and I was already head over heels. The interior of the restaurant is quite bare and a bit personality-less. It was a night when it was blowing a blizzard of snow, and it was cold (no internal heating, although there was a small portable one). But the staff were so friendly, and the food just divine. I do hope they go from strength to strength and word spreads.\n\nI'll be back, and soon, for the banana dosa dessert, and to try the \u00a37.95 lunch deal.

I am a massive fan of South Indian cuisine, so Edinburgh's dining scene is very exciting for me.\n\nWe came along, it was empty. This was probably because it's new and hasn't built up a reputation yet. The waiters were really friendly and the menu was very authentic. \n\nOn offer are thalis, uttapams, idlis, dosas, various curries, and various other dishes you would find in Kerala or Tamil Nadu. My boyfriend and I went for the classic masala dosa, whereas our friend who is visiting from Milan opted for the chicken masala dosa. Dosas are fantastic, as the batter is made of rice and lentil flour, meaning there is no gluten inside! Yay! Unless you choose the rava dosa which is made partly of cream of wheat.\n\nWhile waiting for our food, the waiter brought a plate of poppadoms, mango chutney, lime pickle and a minty raita. These dips were slightly less authentic, but went down well. It was especially nice as it was an unexpected treat. We also got given a glass of a sweet sparkling mint drink, which was very refreshing. \n\nThe food arrived, and it was very nice. The dosa, whilst good, was not the best I have had in Edinburgh. That would be Tanjore or Kalpna, but it came close. Improvements? They could have supplied a little more sambar, made the dosas more crispy, and the masala filling could have been much spicier.... Maybe aiming at British tastes? Despite these little observations, it was very nice, and for a new restaurant they did a great job. I think that a few simple adjustments could be made to make this on a par with the best dosas in town. \n\nOn the dessert menu: Gulab Jamun (deep fried sweet doughy things in a very sweet syrup) , payasam (milky vermicelli pudding with Cardamom), Kulfi (the most delicious pudding ever: a condensed milk ice cream that comes in either pistachio, badam (almond) or mango flavour, flavoured with spices like cardamom, saffron), a few standard ice cream options, and a regional dessert which I don't remember the name of which is made of rice and black lentils. I think it was a type of halwa. \n\nI'd love to come back to try the thalis, some of the other typical dishes, and chat with the lovely staff.

As a previous reviewer mentioned the portions are smaller than you may find elsewhere and also slightly cheaper so it does mean you can try different things. On both visits my fellow diners and I haven't bothered with a starter course, instead we ordered lots of things to come at the same time so that we can share and try everything. There were so many interesting flavours to discover. They have some tasty teas and drinks too.\n\nI can't remember the Indian names of the foods that we had last night from the top of my head. However we did have a seafood curry, a vegetarian curry, a bread thing that was utterly delicious!!!!, coconut rice (which I think I could just eat on its own), tamarind rice and a Dosa, which is a kind of Indian crepe. \n\nThe decor is quite basic, it could put you off at first, but I can assure you without a doubt that it  will no longer matter when when the food arrives to the table - the world is a brighter happier place!

As I said in my previous review, it's hands down the best South Indian food I've had in Edinburgh. \n\nIf you think you know 'Indian food' this is very different to the 'British Indian' made up of heavy naans, chicken tikka massala and vindaloo. There are sauce-based curries, but also lentil and rice crepe-like pancakes called dosas, delicious small but buttery breads called paratha, desserts like Paniyaram and Gulab Jamun, and of course, Mango Lassis (a thick, not-too-sweet mango milkshake).\n\nSince I've been so often, I can now recommend my favourites, having tried many things on the menu:\n\nVegetarian Curry Mains:\n\n- Brinjal curry: aubergine simmered in tomato, quite sweet but also spicy.\n\n- Channa Massala: chickpea curry. So flavourful.\n\n- Dhal & Spinach: lentils simmered to a sauce with lots of spinach. Creamy (but without dairy) and a bit milder.\n\nMeat Curry Mains:\n\n- Chicken chetinadu: mostly sauce based, no veggies in the sauce, but sweet and spicy (it is spiced with pepper not chilli, so isn't too spicy)\n\n- Lamb nilgiri: green in colour, flavoured with mint, but not overpoweringly so. The lamb is so tender.\n\nMeat Mains (not curry):\n\n- Lamb masala dosa. A large, thin crepe made of rice and lentil flour, fried in ghee and stuffed with lamb and potatoes and spices. It's gluten free and really filling. It comes with three types of chutney (one being coconut) and a small serving of sambar (lentil curry sauce).\n\nSides:\n\n- Paratha: Non-wheat bread (so gluten free I think, made with corn) that is round, flaky and absolutely delicious dipped in anything.\n\n- Coconut rice: all the rices come with spices, nuts etc. in them. The coconut rice is by far the best. No plain boiled rice here.\n\nDesserts:\n\n- Gulab Jalum: A very sweet, sticky, not healthy small donut-type ball deep fried then soaked in sugar syrup. Decadent.\n\n- Paniyaram: Less sweet than Galub Jalum, a white small spongey ball with some sultanas in it, and spices. A bit lighter too.\n\nTeas:\n\n- Lemon and Ginger tea. Even this is home-made, no Twinings tea bag here.\n\nI know I'm giving brief descriptions of each, but basically everything is home-made and with the best spices. Every single curry and dish I've had here tastes entirely different: no generic, red, creamy sauces with chunks of meat. Instead, you'll find star anise mixed up amongst the vegetables in your kurma, and mustard seeds in the rice.\n\nLike I said, even the drinks are home-made (I'd also highly recommend their special lime drink, very refreshing) and you can see the put a great amount of love into the food.\n\nThe portions are a bit smaller but the prices are lower, which you means you can order more things to try and still leave very full but without overspending.\n\nI can see myself returning here many times more, a lot.

We were sat at a table for four, which because it was an extendable table meant that I rather uncomfortably sat with my leg curled around the table leg for the duration.\n\nThe menu offers a nice variety of different dishes, and typical of Indian cuisine, veggies are very well catered for. Between the 3 of us, we ordered a veggie and a chicken chettinadu, a veggie biryani (all of which had the same sauce) and a dosa - though sadly just one of these dishes lived up to any sort of expectation.\n\nThe biggest problem with The Cholas is that they fail to remove any of the inedible pods and leaves before serving. This is either because they are rushing to get the food out to the punters, or this is a conscious decision to make the sauces differ from a jar Sharwoods sauce. This might be harsh, but the chettinadu sauce was identical to a pre-made vindaloo sauce.

The chana masala has about 1/2 has many chickpeas as it used to, and is far more a 'sauce' with some floating chickpeas in it. Before it used to be made up of almost purely stewed, soft chickpeas. The dosa once came (home delivery) with a lamb filling that had NO flavour or spice. They must have forgotten to add any spices, but it was tasteless. The chicken curries taste like standard \"UK Indian\" creamy, spicy curries but with no distinct flavour. The paratha is thicker, heavier, less buttery and fresh, and just not as great. The aubergine curry also has less aubergine in it. \n\nThis used to be a restaurant that offered what many Indian restaurants in Edinburgh couldn't.

Medium here is really good - it teeters on medium and hot.\n\nThe Palak Paneer (spinach cooked with homemade cheese) is earthy, spicy and buttery.  This is really, really good.

Both of our dishes cost around $12, and the food portions were sufficiently large.  The clientle during our visit included two older couples (60's), several middle-aged couples (mid-40's), and a family of five with three relatively young children.  It probably wouldn't be my first choice of somewhere to take kids, but it certainly wouldn't be out of the question...depending on the kids and/or the parent's level of patience.\n\nAll in all, Maharani provided a great alternative to other local restaurants around the capitol.

I don't know exactly how that happened given that in high school (and to this day) I was obsessed with Red Dwarf, and if chicken vindaloo was good enough for Dave Lister it sure as hell was good enough for me.  Yet throughout all of my years in college I never had the chance to have a proper curry.  Part of the reason had to be at that time there were no Indian restaurants downtown to my knowledge.  I knew about the ones on Odana but I never drove out that way, so they just remained on the long list of places to go someday.  I also spent a good deal of my later college years frequenting mostly Thai restaurants whenever I had enough scratch to get a proper meal.  So it somehow came to be that I entered my late twenties knowing only that I loved Thai curry, with a huge question mark relating to Indian food.\n\nFortunately I've got a good group of friends that would not let this aberration stand.  One rainy spring night last year we were all arguing about our respective favorites in town, and I let it be known that I'd never tried anything Indian save a curry-flavored ramen one unfortunate time.  We went to Maharani because it was their agreed upon favorite.  I can now say that it is also mine.  It was one of those times when you experience something that in retrospect you don't know how you ever got by without.  I liked everything about Maharani.  My chicken shahikorma, medium spice, was the perfect starting point.  On return trips, and there have been many, I've fallen in love with the chicken shahjahani, the lamb jalfrazie, and the paneer - Oh boy do I like the paneer.  Yet writing this review I realize the one thing that I've not done is the chicken vindaloo.  Next time, for sure.\n\nI'm not usually downtown around lunch, so I've never tried the buffet.  It sounds interesting, but I've been told that the Odana restaurants are superior in this regard.  I can't say one way or another.  I would easily give Maharani five stars except for one drawback: the service can be frustratingly slow.  Sometimes it's exceptional, but more than a few times I've sat at the table, papadams long gone, spooning nibbles of the onion relish, with an empty bottle of Kingfisher, just waiting to order.

With a massive menu that incorporates dozens of different varieties of curries, vegetable dishes, tandooris, biryani, and anything else you can think of, Maharani never gets old. And they manage to execute every dish on their menu with utter perfection, meaning that I have yet to make a visit that I did not completely and fully enjoy.\n\nI start every meal at Maharani with the samosas, stuffed fried potatoes/other veggies which have been spiced in a unique way that I haven't tasted anywhere else. I would describe it as resembling za'atar, a common Palestinian spice, but that's still a bit off and my description can't really do it justice. I tend to ignore all the other appetizers on the menu because while they're all good, the samosas are absolutely unmatched. They also bring out to every table a thin crispy bread along with 3 sauces for dipping. One is sweet, one is spicy, and one manages to pull off both at the same time - it is truly an experience in itself.\n\nI should indicate that Maharani is a vegetarian's paradise; I am a voracious meat-eater and would easily forgo it for any of the vegetable dishes here. Thoughts of the paneer tikka masala, for example, often get stuck in my head all day. I can't spend too long writing about it or I will start fiending for it and go crazy until I get my fix. Think soft, chewy cheese inside a thick orange sauce that has just a hint of sweetness and a heartiness that makes it perfect for dipping bread or pouring it over rice.\n\nWhen you open the menu, you'll notice literally dozens of dishes. If you don't want to spend all day looking at this menu, you need to decide what kind of dish you want. If you pick curry, you have 3 pages alone and need to narrow it down by meat type. I highly recommend the lamb. It always comes perfectly cooked, soft and fatty and practically falling apart when you stick your fork in it.\n\nI do, however, have to take issue with the poor service here. Their lack of speed and attentiveness seems to be a consistent problem, perpetuated by a unorganized system of incompetent waitstaff. There is one girl there who seems to stand around with no idea what she's doing half the time, and she usually ends up taking part of my order and leaving the rest of my service to someone else. I once waited about half an hour just to order my main course.\n\nHowever, I persist with 5 stars because the quality of the food more than makes up for the waitress who tends to get lost in space.

It's a fine enough way to sample a few things, but it's not the best way to experience indian food, because things don't always go together well.\n\nAlso, the default setting for spiciness is often \"wisconsin spicy\", particularly with the buffet.  However, they can, and will on request, bump up the spiciness (both the heat and otherwise).  Having the boti kabob at a spice level of what the chef said was \"how he would eat it\" was revelatory.  It wasn't blindingly hot, but it was deeply savory and complex in a manner that the \"standard\" spiciness wasn't.  Without asking,the standard spiciness can be a smidge bland.  \n\nTheir menu is huge and features both north and south Indian specialties.

This was by far the best, most extensive Indian buffet I've had in the States. I lived in India for a year in the '80s and can't remember every single thing I loved to eat there, but I do remember spending many afternoons in Colaba in Bombay, eating Masala Dosas in a little upstairs restaurant. I'm always tickled when I find dosas on the menu at an Indian place, as it doesn't happen often.\n\nWe went out to dinner here, and our table of 6 let me do the ordering and recommendations. I was very impressed by the fact that when my husband ordered his meal \"hot\", they asked \"Wisconsin hot, or India hot?\" We're fairly adventurous eaters, so he said \"India\" and when he got it, it was definitely spicy. I wouldn't have wanted it much hotter, myself. I ordered the Masala Dosa, and  I wish the dosa itself had been a little crispier, but it was very good.\n\nWhile we were eating, I saw a sign over the buffet that said Pani Puri! I was so excited - haven't had that since 1988 on the streets of Bombay. So, we went back for the buffet today, but no pani puri that I could see. After I tasted some of the other food, it didn't really matter. Nearly everything I tried was great! I generally never order Chicken Tikka Masala because we make it at home, and I almost never find a version out that I like better. When I eat Indian food out, I'd rather try the things I can't make myself. :) My husband tried it and said he likes ours better, so I didn't bother with it, as there was plenty else to enjoy. \n\nOur waiter from dinner nearly a week ago saw us today and actually remembered that I liked masala dosas, which I find impressive. Even more impressive is that they had them in the buffet, too! Wow!\n\nIf we had a restaurant like this near us, we would be spending a ridiculous amount of money here. For those who like their Indian food more spicy (hot), all you have to do is ask. I personally feel this is a great representation of Indian food. As regards the price, I didn't find it excessive at all. I know how much money I spend at my attempts to make good Indian food at home (with all fresh ingredients) and figure you can spend what, $5-6 at McDonalds, getting a burger, fries and drink, or $10 for an all-you-can-eat tasty Indian buffet?

The samosas and naan were the best I had ever had. The naan was super light, fluffy and warm. The samosas had a nice crunchy outside- not soggy and chewy like at a lot of other Indian restaurants. The chicken was cooked perfectly- very tender and sauce had a lot of flavor. I've dined at several Indian restaurants (in Boston primarily) and this was my favorite. My mom had only had Indian once before (with me in Boston) and she didn't care for it so she was hesitant to try it again but she really liked it. Although neither of us were starving when we got there, I still think the portions were enough for 2 meals. \n\nOur waitress was quiet and shy to start but warmed up after awhile. We ended up really liking her- she was quite friendly. I don't recall her name but she was from Serbia. \n\nWould definitely recommend this place.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Fabulous food!

Fantastic, flavorful and probably impossible to beat for the prices at this restaurant. Our waters weren't refilled throughout our meal but we almost didn't notice because the food was so good.

It was literally mashed up chickpeas with no additional ingredients (tahini, anyone? Maybe a little lemon juice?). It was bland as can be.  To be fair, my husband enjoyed his chicken, but it doesn't take a lot to please his palate.

Yeah, the kids, who help run the place are adorable and well-mannered, but that's not a reason to rave about the restaurant ... or is it?  \n\nLet's talk about what's NOT cute:\n\nOne of our companions ordered the kabli pulao from the menu.  He did state, that the meat was fairly decently spiced, but the rest of the dish was pretty bland.  His plate, for some reason, came with plain pilaf, which did even less to relieve the blandness.  My plate had the Afghan rice with raisins, so it was a little better.  However, the presentation of the kabli leaves something to be desired.  I would seriously consider altering its shape, since it arrives at your table shaped like a long .... Well, let's just say, I wondered whether one of my dogs from home got into the restaurant and had an accident on his plate  (my companion assures me, that would not have been possible as the food would then have had more flavor than it did).\n\nI had the lamb shank.  It, too, came with enough rice to feed an Afghan family of 7.  And, as much as I love carbs, most of it sat on my plate at meal's end.  The lamb was very fatty, but, hey, that's what gives it taste.  Unfortunately, it was the ONLY dish with lamb available at the restaurant (which, for an Afghani restaurant is as bizarre as going to an Italian restaurant and them not having pasta!).\n\nAs an appetizer, I had the hummus, which was -- surprise -- bland.  The bread they serve with it -- allegedly naan -- bore an amazing resemblance to Little Caesar's cheesy bread.  Good, but not naan in any sense of the word I know.\n\nMy partner had the chicken tikki masala, which, to me, looked almost like pho (soup) when it came out.  However, he said it was not only very good, but creamy.  They did not, however, bother to ask him how spicy he wanted it, so it came out in a neutral, middle spiciness, which, according to him, added just enough spice to avoid it being --- you got it --- bland.\n\nService was attentive and extraordinarily polite, especially when considering our server probably doesn't yet know how to shave.\n\nOverall, we won't be coming back here.  The food was bland and nothing particularly exciting.  If, as one of the reviewers stated, the cooking reminds her of how mom made dinner at home, she should immediately close Yelp, drive to mom's, and blow up her pots and pans.\n\nMany of the reviewers here have written, that the dishes come with plenty of food.  But this isn't exactly true:  when it comes down to it, the main dish portions aren't big at all and you're served truckloads of cheap rice to fill out the dishes.\n\nAs my partner stated:  \"you really have to read these reviews with a grain of salt\".  \n\nPerhaps.  But if you intend to take reviews of this place with a grain of salt, make sure to bring your own with you:  as bland as the food is here, you won't find any salt laying around to use", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 8, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Charming joint in a sleazy strip mall where you underpay to be overfed.

I disliked the food so much that it's taken me that long to even try Indian food again - and boy am I glad I was able to try again here at Maharaja's Restaurant!!!\n\nWe were looking for \"something different\" to eat on a late Sunday night - they are open daily until 10pm.  We were a party of four consisting of two middle aged adults with our \"kids\" age 27 and 18.  If you're in the mood for something quicker  - they also offer a lunch buffet daily.\n\nThe atmosphere was beautiful - chandeliers... white tableclothes... candles on the tabletops. Authentic yet subtle Indian music played softly in the background. The waiter put the napkins into our laps - very classy.\n\nBefore we went I had looked over the online menu (great descriptions and pictures) so I already had some idea of what I wanted - which made it easier than guessing in person.  Our waiter was very helpful in advising  my 18 year old daughter on what dish she might enjoy.\n\nMy son is a vegetarian and was impressed by the selection - the rest of us are not vegetarians and we were also impressed by the selection!\n\nWe would call this food \"cruise quality\" (back when that really meant something that is).  It was awesome and out of this world great.\n\nWe all took turns sampling each other's meals... which were served in individual serving bowls.  The dishes we ate were:\n\nBeverages: Mango shakes (very unusual and refreshing - especially after a spicy bite of something) and Masala tea (sweet hot tea drink very similar to Chai).  Fresh glasses of ice water were automatically given and refreshed frequently.\n\nAppetizers:\n(complimentary) Daal Poori (fried lentil bread) - think of this kind of like tortilla chips in a Mexican restaurant - crispy but with a different (but very tasty) flavor.  This was served with three different types of dipping sauces.\n\nPickles - these are not any ordinary 'pickles.'  This was very salty and unusually flavored with spices like corriander and chili powder .  We were told some of the ingredients included vegetables... green mango chunks... and some type of Indian fruit.  The piece I ate reminded me somewhat of olives only saltier and stranger.  Unfortunately most of us did not appreciate this dish - but the good news is it only cost .95 to try it.  (very salty and somewhat spicy)\n\nCheese Pakora - flat cheese that has been breaded and fried - tasty though reminiscent of tofu and/or fried chicken.  (not spicy)\n\nSamosas - spicy turnovers stuffed with potatoes and green peas - mixed reviews - the men in our party enjoyed them more than the women did. (yes they were a bit spicy)\n\nSoups:\n\nS.O. had the Mulligatawny soup - it's made with lentils and vegetables and has an unusual spicy flavor and topped with a bit of cilantro.  Very good with the lemon squeezed into it.  I felt it was somewhat reminiscent of a granular pea soup.  It had a little kick to it.  (somewhat spicy)\n\nThe three others of us had Coconut soup - sweet and creamy warm soup with shredded coconut and pistachios.  Daughter felt it \"reminded her of Christmas.\"  I think perhaps it reminded her of eggnog in a way - similar comfort level but different taste. (sweet not spicy)\n\nFor breads we tried plain Paratha (similar to a thick wheat tortilla) and the garlic Nan - it was extra super garlicky and tasty.  (neither spicy)\n\nOur meals were served with a large bowl of long grained rice for us all to share.  We were given a choice of spice levels from mild to hot.  1) Beef Jalfrazie (beef curry with various vegetables); 2) Chicken Tiki Madras (tomato/curry base with coconut - from Southern India)  (3) Vegetable curry (stir fried medley with curry sauce) and I indulged myself in a decadent special of the day 4) Tandoori Lobster (spiced lobster tail cooked in a high heat pressure type cooker called a Tandoor oven).  We all tried each other's dishes and each was enjoyed by all.  My (mostly) vegetarian son even snuck in a bite of lobster! :)  (none of the entrees seemed too spicy for us)\n\nEven though we were stuffed and had leftovers - we knew we \"had to\" have desert.  Daughter opted for the Gulab Jamun (also called 'waffle balls') - sweet fried dough balls covered in a rosewater syrup.  Was reminiscent of perhaps pancakes with syup or cobbler - but of course with a different flavor.  We were very impressed with the kulfi - a sweet custard-like ice cream made with pistachios and almonds.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and kind - answered all of our questions with patience and care... helping us throughout the evening to get the best meal possible.\n\nTo top the evening off - the waiter brought us all hot damp washclothes for our hands.  What exemplary service and attention.  Dinner for the four of us came to a bit over $100 plus a tip - which seems very reasonable for the amount of food we ate - plus leftovers.   Fit for royalty!

Moments later, the waiter returned with a wine for me and what appeared to be a watery-Coke for him. It was obvious after the first sip: the chardonnay and Coke were indeed combined. Ummmm, did this just happen??!! Again our server remained MIA. Finally he returned with my companion's entree. But not mine. About a third of the way into HIS meal, my dinner finally arrived. Sorry, but that is just not acceptable.

The strangest thing is when you get to the end of the buffet line, it's a dead end and you have to like walk awkwardly around people to try to get out... It seems nonsensical.

On my way to the bathroom not to be too dramatic but I was hit by the most aromatic smells I have ever smelled; what a great start!\n\nThe menu is vast and the host/cashier patiently and thoroughly answered all the questions that I had and even offered some suggestions.  The menu is very organized and it is easy to narrow down what you want by spiciness, meat and sauce.  I finally settled on the squash curry but it was definitely hard not to get the sweet potato curry because that sounded amazing too!\n\nI got the home and immediately dove into my food!  The curry was simply amazing and the rice was cooked perfectly.  I do have a couple of qualms about the food however.  I could have done with a lot more curry for my dollar.   The food was delicious but the portion size is definitely on the small side.  I also could have done with a bit more chicken in the curry as well.  With that said however I still feel comfortable giving this place 4 stars because the curry itself was cooked and seasoned perfectly.

I was looking for good Indian food and found the reviews on Yelp for Z Grill, and drove to the grocery on a Sunday evening just in case they were open.

The atmosphere is totally \"family-run business.\"  I believe the owner seated us, and was pleasantly attentive, but also friendly.  The experience at this place feels something like you are being welcomed into the owner's home for dinner. A beautiful young woman in brilliant emerald dupioni silk helped out.  There was a large table of what appeared to be cricket players, not something I am used to seeing in Phoenix restaurants.  Nor am I used to seeing restaurant patrons pray on prayer rugs, which one quietly did.  The room is quite darkly painted, and the decor quite utilitarian, quirky, which only adds to my expectation that this is going to be an authentic and delicious meal.  Not disappointed in that.  The buffet had been hit hard (hungry cricket players?) but there was still plenty and it was delicious.  I am not going to be good at recalling everything by name, but the dal was awesome, tandoori chicken flavorful and moist, a cream chicken dish even better.  Aloo gobi SO good, as was the chickpea dish (don't recall its name), nice tray of condiments, with ample cilantro sauce, and chopped cucumber salad.  There were more dishes I was too full to try including beef nihari, and maybe lamb or goat? Fragrant really long grain rice.  Water in a cooler.  Hot tea.  Sweet rice and Banana custard for dessert.

I'm not quite sure what on the menu is Afghani; I would say that the overwhelming majority of the food served is Pakistani, which is similar to Indian in some respects, but definitely different and noticeably so to the experienced palate.  I saw no Indian food.\n\nFirst, decor.  The pictures in here show a bare, brick-walled seating area.  As plain and jarring as that may be, I wish the restaurant still looked like that.  Since those photos were taken, someone painted the place gray and dark red and the tables black.  These colors definitely should NOT be used in a restaurant and if you're someone easily influenced by your surroundings, it will add a depressing effect to your meal (then again, if you have weight to lose, that may not be a bad thing).  While there are some geographic-designed paintings on the wall with Arabic writing on them, the overall effect is to darken the place and give it the look of a nightclub, that's been opened during the day for some function.  \n\nThe food itself is a mixed bag:  my partner had the chicken tikki masala.  One bite of it convinced me, that I made a huge mistake in not ordering it:  well-spiced; reasonable portion and incredibly tasty.  The only \"mistake\" was to serve it in a large, metal bowl, which gives the impression you're getting less than you are.  It's by no means a huge amount of food, but it's more than enough.  Both our dishes came with copious amount of na'an.  So rice was an absolute non-essential here.  My dish, however, was disappointing.  I got some goat dish and was surprised at what came out.  It came in a noticeably smaller bowl  (at the end of the meal, I could put my bowl comfortably inside his with room to spare and, as I said, his was hardly a large portion).  The food was green and thick, with a consistency between very thick pea soup and creamed spinach.  If there was goat in it, there wasn't much and it was completely shredded  (I THINK, I tasted shreds of meat).  There were absolutely no solid pieces of meat.  It was good, but it made me wonder whether there was some 1980s Pakistani version of the Wendy's commercial, where someone would ask annoyed, \"Where's the Goat?\" instead of where's the beef.\n\nThe buffet today was very hit and miss.  As is typical for buffets, the best food wasn't there and I could have really kicked myself in the rear for not having the tikki masala, which tasted great on the one miserly forkful I had last night.  And, in an ironic repeat performance, there was a serving plate marked \"Goat Paya\" and inside was -- without exaggeration --- just broth and bones.  I don't know, whether someone picked out all the goat earlier; but this was just getting to be a bit frustrating.  The rest of the plates offered were good; just nothing \"wow\".\n\nThe most positive aspect of the restaurant is the service, which is fast, friendly and very willing to explain or answer questions (or make recommendations).  Like yesterday, as we walked in today, there was one party, already done eating, and they left as we sat down.  I don't know whether it was just bad timing or typical, but I have the impression this place doesn't get crowded; and the few reviews here sort of bolster that assumption.\n\nThis place is not cheap in comparison to similar restaurants in the Valley.  Buffet and the goat-that-got-away aside, the food is very good.  But I have to be completely honest in saying that the decor was the absolute killer for me.  I just feel \"oppressed\" sitting in that kind of color scheme and it imposed itself onto the meal.\n\nThe accompanying store is very good for Indian and Pakistani products; but prices cannot compare to, say, Haji Baba, which may not have as big of a selection of Indian/Pakistani foods and spices, but which is better priced by a long shot.\n\nThis restaurant has excellent potential; but as it stands now, it most likely will not impress Western --- and especially, American --- sensibilities much, mainly because of the decor, the lack of customers and food not universally recognized in  the Valley.  This is a shame, not only because Pakistani food deserves the attention, but also because the owners are making an obvious effort to please their customers.\n\nMake the trip here for good food; but keep a very open mind!", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}], "state": "AZ", "stars": 4.0, "latitude": 33.467014}], "85258": [{"full_address": "8140 N Hayden Rd\nSte H115\nScottsdale, AZ 85258", "hygiene": 1, "rest_id": "V9i9LnTg9H2XvzqCVBSOXg", "categories": ["Indian"], "city": "Scottsdale", "review_count": 149, "name": "Tandoori Times Indian Bistro", "longitude": -111.900456296182, "reviews": [{"text": "I dropped into Tandoori Times one night after reading a good review about it in a newspaper.

What Indian Restaurant doesn't do a lunch buffet!?\n\nWell two to be in exact, which happens to be the only two Indian restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale (Tandoori Times and Jewel of the Crown) which is where I work, of course.\n\nThe cuisine...\n\nFirst off, I'm a big believer that you can judge an Indian restaurant by their chicken tikka masala, so since this was my first visit to Tandoori, I had to try it.   Let's just say it was okay at best.  The tikka masala was little bit spicier than usual, which is fine with me, and it also had the right consistency and richness from the cream you expect, but it missed the slight sweetness that contrasts the spices from the sauce.  Disappointing.\n\nNext was the naan.\n\nThe naan came out warm and had that ever so slight crispy outside that I adore, but the inside was slightly doughy or little too moist, which made the naan slightly chewy after it cooled off.  It was still good, but come on; you can at least master the basics right?\n\nWrong.\n\nLet's go to the rice.  First and foremost I don't ever recall where you had to pay for rice at any Indian restaurant.  Well guess what?  I did.  $2.50 to be exact!!!  And for $2.50, did they master this staple side dish?  Noooo...\n\nIt wasn't like it was horrible but I have never had Indian rice that was oily; it was slight, but you could taste and feel it.  Overall texture and flavor was sub par, but I couldn't get over the slightly oily taste and texture.  All I could think was that I was eating Chinese fried rice (b/c of the oiliness) with my tikka masala.  Sigh... Oh well.  Atleast they gave a hearty portion.\n\nDecor was adequate, dark green and red colored sheer covered sections of walls and was used a divider to break up the room.  But what was up with the standard white office acoustical tiles in the ceiling?  Atleast black it out like most restaurants.  I felt like I was at work or in some weird episode of The Office.  An episode when Steve Carell's character, Michael, decides to go to an Indian restaurant at lunch and notices the same thing...but to only make an erroneous comment out loud so everyone in the restaurant could here, starts mocking Indians and their accent and everything then goes down hill: something I would only laugh if on TV, but would not in real life.  I couldn't get over the fact that on top of that they had the audacity to then painted random acoustical tiles dark red and blue, which made your eyes look up at the ceiling.  I'm clueless on that one.\n\nAnyways, I am very hard pressed to find a reason to go back Tandoori Times.  For all you Phoenicians you never had Indian Food, save your taste buds and go to NYC or anywhere back east and try it there.  But if you get the urge, I would suggest go to India Delhi Palace on McDowell Road.

Portions tend to be small and sauces are, by and large, mild and rather one dimensional.  Other than the garlic naan, I cant  remember a dish smelling really awesome as it wafted by, which is a shame considering Indian cuisine is among the world's most aromatic.   \n\nI was eager to share yesterday's lamb boti kabob, as the portion was good sized - about 15-20 small cubes of lamb (not mega kabob sized cubes, but a very respectable portion for $10-11), on the usual tandoori bed of onions and peppers.  The lamb exterior was nice & crusty, but the inside wasnt moist and tender like you'd expect from tandoori - instead it was hard, chewy and disappointing.  Companion's entree was 3 tiny vegetable fritters or dumplings buried in a thick sauce, that looked more like an appetizer.  Chicken dishes are generally better - the tandoori version is good, and similar to most Indian joints.  I recommend the three hot relishes (red sauce, green puree, and pickled peppers) provided tableside, as house preparations, at least in my experience, tend to be mild. \n\nServers are generally Anglo, pleasant and competent during the meal, but just about every time we walk in for dinner at 5 or 5:30, the entire operation seems almost startled by our presence. Nobody's overtly rude, but instead of a really warm welcome, you kind of get four or five employees hanging out at the bar staring at you, as if mentally choosing straws to see who has to deal with the first dinner customer of the evening. It's not oppressive, but it's happened more than once and I'm not crazy about the vibe.  \n\nI do like the complimentary, self serve chai tea and open kitchen, providing an opportunity to stretch one's legs and socialize a bit. Nice touches.   The menu is extensive, all told about sixty items, and reasonably priced for Indian food. Indian textiles, jewelry and artwork is often on display, for sale, and the house music is too loud if you have the misfortune to be seated under a ceiling speaker. It got turned down, eventually, but any restaurant with a few years under it's belt ought to understand customary American tolerances better than that.  \n\nThe atmosphere is up and down. Food's OK. Service is OK. Ask my family and they'll each give it four or five stars.

Service can be abysmal as long as the food is good.  Tandoori Times has changed my beliefs about this, and I now realize that service can be so amazingly terrible that it can completely ruin a dining experience.\n\nDinner started innocently enough.  We sat at a table not far from the bar, and our server started out asking us what we'd like to drink.  The server had a young kid with her, maybe 5-6 years old, and the kid was helping her with things.  I thought it was kind of strange, but I assumed it was probably our server's kid and that she couldn't find a babysitter for the night or something - no big deal.\n\nI ordered a dirty martini, and our server went back to the bar to mix our drinks (she told us the bartender had already gone home for the night, even though it was only 6PM).  Since our table was near the bar, we could hear what was going on there, and within a minute or two, I heard the server asking the rest of the staff if they knew where the olive juice was.  After a minute or two of searching, the staff concluded that they were out of olive juice.  At this point, I expected our server to come back and ask if she could get me a different drink.  She didn't.  Instead, she started asking the staff what she could substitute for olive juice, and they concluded that saltwater would be good.  Ugh.  She brought me the drink and pretended it was completely normal and nothing was wrong.  I pretended I didn't know any better, took a sip of the drink, and told her it was beyond awful and it tasted like they had used salt instead of olive juice.  She acted like she couldn't imagine why this was, and she said that she would take the drink off of my bill.  When she picked the drink up from the table to take it away, the young kid I mentioned earlier bumped into her and knocked the drink out of her hand.  She spilled a bit of it on me, and most of it on the floor.  She then walked away and offered no help of any kind - no napkins or anything.  This spilled drink stayed on the floor _the entire rest of the meal_, and they never cleaned it up.  When we eventually left, I was tempted to \"slip\" on it, pretend I severely hurt myself, and start yelling about how careless their staff was, how they could be held liable for injuries, blah blah blah.  I just wanted someone to recognize that it was ridiculous for them to not clean up things that they had spilled, but it really seemed like they didn't care at all.\n\nAnyway, the server asked if I wanted something else to drink instead.  I went for a gin and tonic.  When she got back to the bar, the first thing I heard was \"What's in a gin and tonic? How do I make one?\" Sigh.  Anyway, the gin and tonic turned out okay, all things considered, but at this point I was pretty sad from what had already happened.\n\nFinally, we got to ordering our food.  Our server came over, asked what we'd like, and as we started telling her, we noticed she wasn't paying any attention.  She was just watching her kid and talking to her.  So, we got to repeat our order again, and this time she actually paid attention and wrote it down.  Yay.\n\nAwhile later, our food came out - we got two naans (one paneer, one chicken), chicken tikka masala, palak paneer, and rice.  The naans were pretty average, nothing really special.  The chicken tikka masala was actually pretty good, and was the only decent part of the whole meal.  The palak paneer was some of the worst I've ever had, and I'm pretty sure they just emptied a defrosted bag of frozen spinach over some cubes of paneer.  It tasted like no spices or any kind of flavoring had been added.\n\nIn the middle of eating, we were interrupted by the server and her kid for a rather awkward moment.  The server made her kid apologize for knocking over my drink, and then they walked away.  Congratulations Tandoori Times on making our dinner that much more uncomfortable.\n\nOur server didn't seem to care about anything throughout the whole meal - she never asked how anything was, if we needed anything, etc. When we were done eating, she came by and dropped off the check, without removing our plates from the table or even saying a word.  We had been charged an extra $2.50 just to have rice with our entrees, which I think is pretty ridiculous.  Anyway, I took out my credit card and she came by to pick it up, again without saying a word.  We left quickly, wanting to get our Tandoori Times experience over with as soon as possible.\n\nWhen we left, I was pretty frustrated and angry, which is not how one should feel when leaving a restaurant.

You would make it trendy inside. You would offer a nice bar. You would hire American people as your servers. And you would make the food not so spicy. In essence, you would create the PF Chang's of Indian Food. You would give it an Indian sounding name like Tandoori TImes and remove any vestiges of Pakistan as Indian restaurants are better recognized and thus seen as a safer option among the mainstream.  Well, that's exactly what Tandoor Times is. \n\nBeing Indian, I prefer Indian food meaning I like all the grilled meat items but they better be able to make quality sabjis and vegetarian dishes too.  Tandoori Times is a Pakastani restaurant; it's not an Indian restaurant. It's almost the same but their dishes are different. Pakastani cuisine involves Tandoori items and grilled items. Their cooking style is less spicy and offers less cream in their dishes.  Indian (Punjani/North Indian) food involves Tandoor items as well in addition to vegetable dishes, more variety and types of curries and is spicier and more flavorful in general. If you are a non-vegetarian like myself, you can survive on the curries and the shish kebob and other meat items. However, when you taste their chaat, deserts and vegetarian sabjis, this restaurant clearly does not know what they are doing.  If you are vegetarian of Indian descent, you will be sorely disappointed.  Nothing against Pakastani cuisine but vegetarian dishes are not your forte much like curries and grilled options are not really a part of South Indian cooking.  \n\nThe food is on the mild side. Of course, if you ask them to make something hotter, they can but their food in general is not very spicy and is bland with the exception of some of their curries.  If you are a Non-Indian and you want to try Indian food for the first time, this would be a good place to start. If you are someone who has eaten quality Indian food and wants the real thing, avoid this place because this is as far from being the real thing as possible. \n\nThe service and ambience was quite nice. I think that's the real draw of this restaurant since most Indian restaurants have poor service and often a dirty or claustrophobic environment.  This is a trendy restaurant in old town Scottsdale that you could take a date to.  The service was good when we went there but at the same time the servers were pretty ignorant of the menu and didn't know a lot about Indian food.\n\nBeing Indian, this place was just a bunch of hype.  Yes, it was neat to see friendly American people serving Indian food since I'm used to Indian waiters who are abrupt and to the point.  I liked the ambience but the food was disappointing. Their palak paneer honestly tasted as if some non-Indian person decided to try and make it from a cookbook at home. It was not spicy nor was it cooked properly. Their malai kofta was not even malai kofta....let's put it that way.  I will say this, their Tandoori chicke was probably the best I've had in the valley and that's not suprising since Pakastani cooking involves meat and they know how to grill meat well but outside of their meat dishes, it was completely lackluster. \n\nThe bottom line is that if you are an Indian person or a person who is used to eating quality Indian food and you want honest to goodness quality INDIAN (not Pakastani) food, avoid this place.  If you are a non-Indian person wanting to check out Indian/Pakastani food and just want to have a good time, this place is for you.

Luckily I was on the expense account so I didn't care about the cost too much. Food took a while to come out, but there was also a large party ahead of me which got served first. The kabab wrap consisted of a monster thick kabab, nothing wimpy like some other restaurants to with the usual accompaniments. \n\nThe butter chicken was thick and creamy and the serving dish was filled to the brim (almost overflowing). There was a decent amount of chicken in there, definitely not skimpy like many other restaurants. It tasted delicious and no one seasoning was overpowering.

A quick U-Turn, brake check, sharp right, up a ramp and into a parking place. That complex is like a maze and I feel lucky that I located my destination.\n\nWalked in the yelp stickered door and was hit with that delicious Indian restaurant smell. What was lacking was the scent of mesquite which you can usually pick up at most places from the tandoor. This was an upclass place so I figured it was just vented well. The place was really cool on the inside having this upscale lounge type feel. Nice and dim and easy on the eyes.\n\nThe guy who was double duty as host/waiter seemed a bit annoyed that I was walking in the door at 8:45 when they were open until 10. A tad on the snooty side asked if I was picking up or eating in with a heavy insinuation that I better be picking up. Luckily I was saved by my phone going off as my friend couldn't find the place. I got to bark two for dinner and walked out the door to find my friend.\n\nWas happy when our waitress came to the table since I didn't want much to do with the host. She took our drink order and asked if we needed a few more minutes to which I made the mistake of replying yes. Normally I have these meals pre planned and know exactly what I want but this was a last minute change of destination. I regretted not ordering right then because we didn't see her again for a long while.\n\nMy friends have learned that I usually know what's good and just let me order for the table. One of them was an appetizer and as usual I was asked if I wanted that first or with the meal. I try and condense the time that I'm eating bad food to limit the sugar spikes it might create. I'm not even sure why they ask because 9 out of 10 times they bring it first anyway :( this was one of those 9 times. \n\nWe waited for what seemed like an eternity for this one dish to show up. At that point I just started eating because I was super hungry. The rest took another 15 minutes to get there. Kitchen here is REALLLLY slow and we were one of only 3 tables.\n\nOne more note.. do yourself a favor and get a table. The booths here are horrible. They press you forward into the table and are very uncomfortable on the back after a while.. and you will be there a while :P\n\nFood Details:\n\nOnion Bhaji:\nI ordered these thinking they were something different. They were basically battered onion strings with what I would guess was a plum based sauce. I was expecting the Indian fritters that I couldn't remember the name of at the time. It was still tasty.\n\nBread Basket:\nSampler of 5 different types of Naan. The only ones I would recommend are the onion and garlic. In the rest the texture was a little different but no flavor profile change and rather dull.\n\nChicken Tikka Masala:\nMmmm I love this dish and it was pretty darn good here. I have had better but it wasn't in the valley. I haven't chowed on much Indian since returning here many years ago.\n\nSaag Paneer:\nTexturally this was way off from what I'm used to. It was almost like a ground spinach. The spice profile of the dish was excellent but I was a little disappointed in the Paneer. This isn't a strong cheese anyway but this really had no flavor to it. I'm used to it adding at least a creamy/richness to the dish. This one had the taste/texture of firm tofu.\n\nTandoori Chicken:\nI was REALLY craving some tandoori chicken and I was disappointed. It wasn't bad but it lacked the bold flavor depth this dish usually has. I also totally missed any mesquite/wood/smoke flavor that should have been there. Between the lack of wood taste and smell I think this place may use a gas driven Tandoori verses a real mesquite charcoal version.\n\nKheer:\nRice pudding is great stuff and adding almonds and raisins to it... yum. This is where someone played a cruel joke on us. The dessert glass was an odd shape and the spoon didn't fit all the way! If you wanted to retain your manners there was 1/4 of the dessert you were unable to reach. Manners were tossed out the window :)\n\n\nI agree fully with the 3 stars this place has averaged for itself. I made the mistake of trusting some friends over trusting yelp. I could have done much better that night but this was A-OK and tamed the craving. We felt very rushed towards the end of the dinner to pay and get a move on.

I was even more encouraged when I walked in and found an almost exclusively Indian (appearing) clientele.  To begin, the service was a little off.  There was maybe 10 people in the restaurant yet we waited a full five minutes or so for a greeting.  When he did come by, he asked if we were ready to order and I looked at him and said, \"You know, we might need to look at the menus first.\"  Perhaps he's used to \"regulars.\"  Anyway, we began with the Onion Bhaji, essentially an Indian version of onion rings, and Raita, a cucumber, potato, mint and yogurt sauce.  The Onion Bhaji looked good in all its fried glory, but was so heavily battered my wife and I both felt ill after trying a few pieces.  You could not taste the onion at all.  Major disaster.  The waiter began to redeem himself by noticing that we had hardly touched it and offered to take it off the menu.  The Raita was fresh and flavorful but didn't exactly fit with anything we ordered and a recommendation of what to eat it with would have been helpful.  We also ordered the Naan and simply put it was killer---hot, light, wonderful.  First score at Tandoori TImes.  My wife ordered the Chicken Makhani and one sampling of the sauce had us both oohing and ahhing at its rich, buttery flavor.  Nothing to say here again but killer.  I ordered the Lamb Korma, and though I found the dish to be decent, it was just very plain when compared to other Indian dishes I have had that just burst with varied bold flavors.  I also asked that it come spicy (6 out of 10) but instead it came with NO spice at all, while my wife's dish came pretty hot and was supposed to be mild.  I wouldn't order again but it may be right up someone else's alley.  FInally, we ordered a plate of rice to accompany our meals.  The rice looked and tasted like it had been sitting around since yesterday (and maybe it was!).  My wife grew up on rice and loves it more than she loves me, so when she frowns at the sight and scowls at the taste of the rice, it is bad rice.

I had the goat curry, which was outstanding, and the tandoori lamb chops - which was not perfect - way more pieces than I imagined, but thinly sliced, and not as juicy as I had hoped.  The rice was absolutely perfect - basmati rice with some whole cloves dotted throughout.

I think if you can't afford to find a babysitter so you can enjoy your evening and in particular so you can NOT spoil the evening for others, then PLEASE stay home. As usual, the people with the baby were impervious to its crying, they were obviously so accustomed to it that it does not bother them. I am not sure whether to hold this against the restaurant. they could have asked the people to take the baby outside until it settled, but it was cold outside and I wouldn't want to make them do that to the kid.

My order of Chicken Vindaloo was absolutely delightful spiced just as I requested HOT.  Our double order of bread came hot and delish(we don't eat rice).  My husband's Lamb Tikka was generous and nicely done.  During our meal, the belly dancer started her act.  This meant that the loud music would soon begin.  AND I MEAN LOUD.  I don't know if it was that we were in that small room, but my eardrums were about to burst.  There was no relief until we ended our meal.  The belly dancer could not be seen from our room so we stood up to peek at what was going on.  It was an attractive young lady, dressing in belly dancing garb dancing to Indian pop music.  Not really belly dancing.  (I've done belly dancing myself.)  Next, dessert.  I ordered the Kheer.  It was absolutely amazing.  It was creamy with sliced almonds and raisins.  Probably one of the best I've had anywhere.  \nI gave Tandoori Times 4 stars because the music was too loud and it kind of spoiled the experience for us.  Other than that the food is really authentic and delicious.  I hope that the management will consider toning down the music at least for the poor people in the back room.

I had been looking for a new Indian restaurant and was excited to try it out. \n\n The restaurant was busy, and we waited about 5 minutes until a table was available.  We were seated on the patio behind a pillar (bad idea). Our server came over after a few minutes to take our drink order.  He came back with our drinks, and we were unsure as to what we wanted to order for dinner but we ordered the aloo tikki to start. \n\nThe appetizer took a long time to come out (about 20 minutes) and our server didn't come back to take our order until shortly before our appetizer arrived.  We ordered the bengun bhartha and chicken curry with garlic naan. \n\nAnother 20 or so minutes went by after we were finished with our appetizer before we saw our server again. He set our dishes down and asked if we wanted anything else. I asked if we could have a side of rice because I just guessed that he had forgotten it, or it was on its way as all Indian places I have been to serve rice as an accompaniment to dishes. \n\nI told my boyfriend I didn't want to eat my meal without rice, so I waited about 10 minutes.... no rice... our server continued serve other tables and walk away before my boyfriend could flag him down. Finally, I decided to not let the already mildly cool food get colder, so I reluctantly began eating. \n\nThe curry tasted great and was well spiced.  I also loved the bengun bhartha (I have only found one place that makes it the way I like it). \n\nAfter we were done eating the two dishes, the server finally came over (no rice in hand) to ask how our meal was.  My boyfriend politely asked for boxes, our rice to go (since they seemed to be still cooking it), and the check.  We waited another 5 or so minutes to get our bill, and the server says, \"don't worry about the rice.... it's on me\"  WHAT?? WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO PAY EXTRA FOR RICE???? \n\nMy boyfriend got up and went looking for the manager. He spoke to the hostess and found out the manager had stepped away, but she called and spoke to him. My boyfriend explained our experience, and how it was our first time dining there. The manager said that we would either wait for him to return, or the hostess could take 15% off our bill.  Not wanting to wait any longer for anything else, my boyfriend just asked for the discount. \n\nThe food was great, but the service was crap. Absolute crap.

I believe I visited on their second or third day of operation.\n\nI entered a restaurant with modern decor that was spotlessly clean. Having read about the restaurant in the Republic prior to arriving, I immediately headed towards one of the two flat screen televisions to place my order. Ordering was easy and quick and the menus offered descriptions of the Indian food for those who may be unfamiliar with the cuisine.\n\nI ordered butter chicken, naan bread and Basmati rice. This came to $8.50. It was a pleasure to see, as is done in many other countries, that the tax was included in the price of each item. While I could have swiped my credit card to pay at the \"menu monitor,\" I chose to pay cash and received service from the friendly lady at the cash register. She also validated my parking in the AZ Center garage. My butter chicken (you can choose naan or rice as a side) was $7.50 and my naan was another dollar, which brought the total cost of my meal to $8.50. Because I was ordering take away, I did not order a drink. I did, however, see that the restaurant is applying for a liquor license; presumably for the sale of beer given that there is no \"bar\" in the quick service space.\n\nAfter a wait of maybe five minutes, I received my food in what one might describe as \"higher-quality\" Chinese food boxes. The naan bread was wrapped in foil.\n\nAfter a short drive home, I transferred my food from box to plate and began to enjoy my dinner. While the rice was very well cooked (generally fluffy and not clumped together), the naan (as the Republic also reported) was somewhat disappointing. While it was definitely naan and not pita bread, I found my serving to be almost cracker-like in texture and too cool of a temperature. (I assume this may be because the naan was prepared earlier in the day. I wonder, though, if they could have devised a way to warm the bread before serving in a convection oven?) My butter chicken was flavorful, but also rather cool in temperature. Portion sizes were more than adequate.\n\nWhen I visited, the restaurant was empty. Because I hope this restaurant will survive (I think the concept is novel), I sent some of the concerns detailed above in the form of constructive criticism to the restaurant after eating my dinner.

Everything from tandoori chicken to palak aloo. Every dish was so flavorful and authentic. Having spent two years overseas where I associated with several Indians, I know they would have been suitably impressed. The waiter brought naan to the table and was there when our water glasses emptied.

It should go without saying, but I have been to several all-you-can-eat buffets and have witnessed first hand the amount of leftover food that has to be thrown away because people take too much. Personally I think part of the blame should be placed on the cooks/managers for not putting out a better product, but certainly the customer is largely to blame. Hence, a sign that clearly articulates the Maharaja's expectation of its customers is a good thing.

Cannot beat that of an evening for me. \n\nOnto the restaurant the decor has had a little bit of a face lift of late with some newly designed posters, as has the menu. Not going to go into too much detail as previous reviewers have mentioned this, but it is a good thing. One thing that stuck me is the new additions to the menu - Kismot Naga pickle and Iron Bruna, yep a curry with Irn Bru. \n\nThis is a family run restaurant and the sons greet you on the door with a bit of friendly banter. You can see the other family members beavering away in the kitchen when you first enter.  \n\nThe food here is always up to high standards and our last outing was no exception. We opted for the pickle trays, poppadoms, raitha and naga chilli pickle. all washed down with lots of Mango lassi. The starter was great but the naga chilli in particular was excellent, beware this comes with an 18 certificate warning and is very spicy. \n\nThe main courses were Veg Madras, Chicken Masalla, Prawn passanda and Chicken Tikka North Indian Chilli Garlic. All were great their Chilli Garlic is still my favourite version of this disk in Edinburgh. One thing to bear in mind you get lots of rice and the nans are large so unless you ha vent eaten all day a rice and nan portion does 3 easily. Either that or it was something to do with the fact we order another jug of lassi, but i don't think I ever come away as full eating any where else. \n\nThumbs up from me.\n\nFavourite dishes here:\n\n- Mums Desi Khani, homemade curry with limited availability. Worth a try if you are there at the weekend. \n- Mango lassi by the jug\n- Bhindi\n- North Indian Chilli Garlic\n- Any of the Madras dishes\n- Naga Chili pickle, beware very spicy\n- Methi \n- Raitha", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 2, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "Easily the best traditional style curry house in Edinburgh, long since recommended but we'd never gotten around to a visit.\n\nWe loved it, the service was great and the knowledge of the food was second to none, able to tailor our flavours to the level of heat we wanted, and since I'm a softie and my wife loves the intense heat this was great.\n\nIt reminded me of the best Indian food I'd eaten as a student, but better.\n\nI cannot wait to go back.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I was looking for a nice restaurant in Edinburgh while I was in town for a short visit, and decided to give Kismot a try.

The place is clean and attractive and has a reasonably priced menu.  We saw that most of the clientele was ethnic so it reasoned that the food would be good.  We started out with two meat samosas made with ground lamb (3.99.)  Not greasy and full of meat flavored beautifully with fragrant spices. Enjoyed it very much. They were accompanied by coriander chutney and a tamarind/spicy mixture. Don't know what that was.  We also had Chicken Vindaloo (6.99), Chicken Biryani, Lamb chops and naan.  The Chicken biryani was accompanied by lentils and yogurt. The yogurt was amazing as were the lentils whose flavor profile included coconut.  The lamp chops serving was ample but the lamb was chopped into pieces.  My eating partner said they tasted good.  The vindaloo was very good although not as spicy as I had asked them to make it. Restaurants are afraid to add too much spice until they get to know you.  Everything was great until I decided to order the Kheer (1.00) for dessert.  I like my Kheer with raisins and I asked if it had raisins to which they answered yes.  No raisins in the Kheer but I found it to be very strange (at least for me), I have never ever had Kheer with noodles in it. Meaning, Kheer which is a rice pudding is usually made with basmati rice. Well this one had noodles as well and I I did not enjoy it.  Since it costs only $1, I did not make a fuss. If I had paid over $3, I would have returned it to them.  When I got up to pay for the Kheer (because we had already paid our bill), the owner did not want to charge me for the Kheer. (Maybe he read my mind or my stomach) . I resisted the temptation (not to pay) and insisted the owner take his money.  (I DO want them to stay in business!)  \n It is a family run business and it shows.  I don't have a problem eating off of paper plates with plastic utensils, if this bothers you, this is not the place for you. By the time we left at 8:30PM, the restaurant was almost full of patrons.

What a terrible disappointment.\nThis review really breaks down into two categories:  what we think about the establishment as it is now, and how it compares to the old place (which was a solid 4-5 star rating).\nWe walked in and were greeted by Ray, the head cook from the old Spice.  He has real skills, so we gave him a chance.   But alarm bells were going off.  The sauces had brown deposits around their edges in the warmer.  The meats had been there for a while.  We ordered masala with chicken, chickpea ceviche and some samosas.  Another guy was there, but not really helping.  Just standing around.  Ray explained that this was a \"Chipotle-style\" program now.  My immediate thought was that it was an affront to Chipotle to even compare.  Maybe theoretically.  \"Chipotle-esque\", perhaps.  Our food was slopped into some pretty nice take-out containers (we kept them, as they are washable), and we headed for the table.  The masala was awful.  If that sauce is not out of a can, then they should move up to canned sauce.  The rice and quinoa were dry.  The chicken was grainy and flaccid.  The samosas were starchy, spice-less and pulpy.  The chickpea ceviche had all the flavor of canned chickpeas.  No tamarind sauce was present.  We doctored up the masala with hot sauce to make it edible and took a few bites.  I looked at Val.  She glanced at the door.  Ray smiled at us.  We were trapped.  Please understand that if you give that chef good ingredients, he is a magician.  But if you cut your ingredient costs to the bone and buy garbage, that is what you will serve.  Pre-make everything, and it slips further downhill.  The veggies were clearly a heavily spiced food-service Vegetable Medley.  Is anyone in the Paradise Valley area looking for a talented chef?  Save him from this hell.  Please.

I realized before I ordered that this Indian food is intended to be a more healthy style of Indian food so I wasn't sure what to think. Once I Dug in I could definitely tell that it was a lighter style of Indian food, still had all the great flavors but it wasn't has heavy as the Indian food I normally eat is. All the sauces were awesome. All the veggies were really fresh. The style and the way you order is pretty cool because you can see everything right in front of your face and mix and match with your dish. I can't really think of anything bad to say about the place, I did like some sauces more than others but nothing was bad. I def plan to stop in more often. \n\nTHE LONGER STORY for ya readers out there.... \nThe Vindaloo was really awesome. Perfect amount of spiciness to it and def a must have for next time. \nThe curry was probably my favorite. It was really really good, I could mix that with just about anything at home. Not oily, not to much flavoring. I'd love to buy a jug of it and smother some wings. \nThe masala was also really good and I def didn't leave any behind. \nThe mint chutney was really cool. It was zesty and next time I go back I'm gonna get a wrap and have a bunch draped over my chicken. \nThe tamarind chutney was nice because it wasn't too thick and sugary. It was a nice little addition over my rice. \nI tried all the meats and they were definitely good. I favored the chicken and tofu over the beef but it was still good. I'm not really a tofu kind of guy but it was definitely good to have in the bowl. It was kind of like having chunks of pineer. \nThe Mango Lassie was aw aw awesome!  I've never really had one that I didn't like though but some have been to thin for my likings. \nThe manager asked me if I wanted to sample the chai and the lemonade so I did. I've never thought I'd get so excited about lemonade but that lemonade was absolutely awesome, I'd like to make some good cocktails with it. If it was on the shelf in the grocery store I probably buy it once a week. \nThe chai was also really really good, I've always loved cardamom and that chai was packed full of it. It definitely didn't taste like anything else I've ever had. I liked how it was cold too. \nThere was also a hot sauce that they gave to me on my plate and it definitely has some Kick but it's got really good flavor too.  It was perfect because most of their sauces are pretty mild but I like some heat added so it worked out well. \nAll in all, I'll definitely go back. It's nice to find a place that isn't the same as everyone else. One cool thing I noticed, I didn't feel really weighed down after I finished. A lot of the time after eating Indian food, I'm ready for bed. \nThe staff was cool and friendly and the place was super clean! Definitely check them out. If the place is busy and the bald chef isn't walking around offering samples, ask him for one. I'm sure he'll give em to you.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "New location New format old name. \n\nIndian food is often relegated to lunch buffets and white table cloth dinners.

Most \"Indian restaurants\" you get here serve North Indian style - large curries and rice (food baby, food coma, nom but ooft).\n\nSouthern Indian cooking is, first off, a lot spicier and secondly they use a lot more bread and pancake-like ingredients rather than rice. Such as dosas: lentil and rice pancakes, stuffed with all sorts of delicious fillings. (see uploaded photo)\n\nFor want of another way to describe it, think crepes.They're kinda like that, but not. And the ones we got were considered SMALL. Apparently they can come twice as big.\n\nSo, they're tasty. Really tasty and much lighter than the traditional curry. And at Mezbaan anyway, they're cheap! \u00a33 for a dosa? With a side of mango chutney (home-made and delicious) and some veg curry? And twice as filling as a sandwich that would cost probably a few quid more? Yes please.\n\nI had the mushroom one that was nom. Everyone else had a masala dosa, made with potato and there wasn't a crumb left. And someone had the lamb dosa which was personally my favourite, with some really fresh, fragrant sweet basil. Totally getting that next time.\n\nI also got to taste both the mango lassi and the almon and saffron lassi. The almond and saffron lassi came decorated with little strands of saffron that turned it yellow on top. It was certainly an acquired taste, as it wasnt too sweet, but did the perfect job at neutralising the spice. \n\nThe main menu looked interesting too. Smaller tapas dishes with things like honey chicken (never seen before on an Indian menu). I think dosas might be one of my new favourite things, and rather than the odd dosa-thrown-in-for-good-measure that other Indian restaurnats might too, Mezbaan specialise in them. \n\nSo, in summary, dosa do.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 3, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "The food is good, but the service isn't and the venue is unlikely to impress.

It was a cold January night outside and whilst the restaurant was warmer than outside, we both had to dine with our jackets on. And my toes were as cold as ice cubes by the time I left.

The first time, my friend and I ventured in and my love sensual decor did a delighted dance.  The walls are a warm, almost Tuscan texture, and the windows are hidden by a dalliance of lovely, transparent, red, gold, and emerald curtains. My friend and I shared the Butter Chicken and the Saffron clay oven platter. The butter chicken held pieces of tender, moist chicken in the most delicious, buttery, flavorful sauce over rice. The Saffron platter was a mix of chicken, shrimp, and Indian sausage slow cooked with tandoori spices in a clay oven.  We also ordered the garlic naan bread, which I thought was to die for.\n\nToday, I thought I'd try the lunch buffet since I had some time and wanted more than my fridge had to offer. The buffet is $11 and contained 8 dishes, salad, and yummy Indian sauces. I had the tandoori chicken wings, a vegetable samosa, spicy chicken curry, lamb curry, a lentil dish as well as two other vegetable dishes.  I am ashamed to admit that I am not fluent in the names of Indian dishes. (Maybe I'll tackle that in 2011)\nAlong with the buffet came a basket of regular naan. I'm no expert of all breads Indian, but this bread was SO yummy.  Clearly just baked in a hot oven, the bread glistened with butter over it's hot bubbly dough.  It was savory with almost an undetectable hint of sweetness.\nAll in all the food seemed authentic, not too spicy (and you know I like my spicy...), but in some cases I thought needed a smidge more salt.

I know it sounds strange, but it was actually quite successful. The sauce wasn't sickeningly sweet and artificial tasting as sweet and sour often can be, and we loved tasting Chinese flavors in a dish that actually had some heat.\n\nNon-fusion dishes were just as successful.

Other than that, everything else was okay (lamb masala, chana masala, paneer masala) to not-so-great.\n\nOf the not so great items was the dal (bland), the orange chicken (soggy, overly sweet --- I'm not sure how this fits in with everything else - this s*(t is about as American as apple pie), and the kheer. \n\nI have to take a minute about how they messed up the kheer. Not only did they cheap out on the rice (they used some sort of long grain instead of basmati), they may have used leftover rice to make it with the rather large clumps of rice emerging from the pudding. If you stirred the rice while you were cooking it, this doesn't happen. In addition, the rice was undercooked and hard. Plus you don't even get that hit nice hit of cardamom at all.  Bleh. Major turn off. \n\nThe garlic naan came to the table nice and hot and flavourful. However texturally, it was a little too hard, a little too doughy and not enough flakiness. \n\nSporting a tomato chutney, an unpleasantly weak mint chutney (where's the mango chutney?) and a rather watery raita, I was disappointed by the lack of pickles and other condiments normally seen at other places.\n\nGiven the plehtora of places available in the valley that offer better selection, better quality and overall better prices, I'd skip this place for the lunch buffet. 2 starred review.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 7, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "Stopped by for lunch with a few coworkers to get additional opinions and to order something off the menu with some kick to the spice level.

For dinner, the food was okay, but the service was severely lacking. It took forever (about 2 hours total) to order our food, get water and refills, get our food and finally pay our check. The butter chicken was so-so. The aloo gobi even less remarkable. The 2 kinds of naan were too doughy. Despite this mediocre experience, I was willing to give their lunch buffet a try, especially since the wifey was curious to experience their cuisine. What a mistake that was... First of all, the price of $11.99 is at the high end for Indian lunch buffets, and this place is the exception to the rule that you get what you pay for. The selection and quality was downright pathetic and frankly embarassing. Ok, to be fair, it was still better than our abysmal experience at Sherpa House (in Golden, CO) but that is setting the bar extremely low. There were a whopping total of 8 hot trays consisting of items such as onion \"pakora\" (basically onion ring fragments), orange chicken, daal, chana masala, goan fish curry, lamb curry, paneer masala, and (non-Basmati) rice. There was also a small salad bar section and kheer. There was a surprising lack of classic staples such as mango chutney, samosas, Tandoori chicken, any kind of chicken curry, or saag. Although we enjoyed the fish curry, it could not make up for the lack of selection and quality of the rest of items. The garlic naan was so-so. It was simultaneously too doughy yet too hard and dry on the bottom. The kheer was the worst we've ever had. It lacked cardamom flavor and contained numerous clumps of rice. At least this time around, the service was half decent. The only other mitigating factor was they were running a $2 off promotion, although we had to specifically ask for the discount to be applied. That being said, the fact that this place garners stellar reviews is a real head scratcher. Perhaps, restaurants located in the (relative) boonies are held to a lower standard. Who knows?

A few weeks ago told a different story. I had a craving for curry on a Monday night but Saffron is closed on Monday. I did not know this until after I tried three doors before seeing their hours posted on the first door revisited. I was frustrated. Today, though, is Wednesday and Saffron is open.  I parked at about 5:45 in an open and empty lot. As I approached, a man opened the door and warmly welcomed me in. Good impression number one. I was seated immediately as the restaurant was mostly empty much to my surprise. When I was seated I noticed the strong aroma of the many exotic spices I would be enjoying shortly. I also noticed the Indian music lending itself to a comforting and authentic dining experience. Good impression number two. Within less than a minute of being seated I was brought a glass of water, a food menu, a wine menu, a basket of crispy flat bread stuff (apologies for not knowing the true name), and two sauces. A mint sauce and a tamarind sauce. The latter of the two sauces was my favorite. I took a few minutes to familiarize myself with the menu. I settled upon Palak Chicken and a side of Garlic Naan.  The naan came out quickly and was absolutely delicious. It was hot, crisp, and chewy with plenty of minced garlic on top. A few minutes later my Palak Chicken came out in a hot bowl and accompanied with    long grain rice in a separate bowl. The Palak was a brilliant green from the spinach. It was topped with cream and a sprig of cilantro. A beautiful presentation to be sure. I had trouble finding the chicken until I spooned it on to my plate. It was there hiding out amongst the spinach base. It was not the most tender chicken I have had at an Indian restaurant but chicken does not need to be fork tender to be good. It still fell apart in my mouth. Good impression number three. I ate all of my rice but took my Palak Chicken and Garlic Naan home to have for lunch the next day. My check came as I was bagging up my leftovers. It had a smiley face drawn on it. Talk about service with a smile.  Good impression number four. This was very much a comfortable and relaxing dining experience. From the soft spoken and friendly waiter to the delicious food cooked to my spice request of 3 (out of 10), my night at Saffron was just what the doctor ordered.

There's really something to be said for this.  I've been to some other places and the glasses (or the water) are cloudy, or the buffet itself isn't appealing due to spilled items next to the buffet or on the floor, etc.  While this may not be the biggest place or have the biggest selection of items, the place is CLEAN and well organized. :)\n\nNow with those things said, I'm sure there are those of you who may be thinking, \"Hey, I read a few other reviews and they mentioned that there weren't that many items on the lunch buffet.\"  I sort of agree...  Then again, consider that the items they have available are not always the same items day in and day out and that the things that are on the buffet have great flavor.  It's $11.99 for the lunch buffet.  It's not some huge dinner feast, and it's not $49.95.  $11.99 will get you a sandwich and a drink at the place across the street and this is a MUCH better option for the same money.

The paneer in the korma had an excellent flavor and I cannot wait to try other dishes with it on my next visit. As other reviews have stated, the garlic naan is amazing. The garlic had a fresh flavor and the bread was perfect for scooping the korma. \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the galub jamun. You will get three \"honey balls in rose syrup\" and they are quite tasty. The perfect end to a great meal. \n\nAs a suggestion, if you are going with a group of 4 or more, you will be fine ordering a few dishes and sharing them family style.

A Thai curry is far different from the curries in an Indian restaurant. Either way curry is a comfort food to me. It is astounding how one meal can change ones mood so completely and curry fits that profile. Tonight I had a more mild curry at Saffron Flavors of India. More so I had a full experience featuring curry. I started with the complimentary papadan and two sauces of which I am not all too familiar but I am a fan of nonetheless.

If service was more attentive, I'd definitely give this place 5 stars. When our dinners arrived, the server placed a single petite rice plate for all four of us to share.

I didn't try this but noted this for future reference.  I made a second trip to the buffet to get something sweet to offset my disposition.  I got one gulab jamun and it was very good.

I was near ecstatic when I learned of their upcoming opening.  I've been peeking in windows and organizing a weekly drive-by to check on their progress.  Well, after all of my patient waiting they finally opened yesterday.\n\nAs I am recovering from the nasty cold that has taken over much of the Henderson/LV population, my husband and I decided to get some food to go.  \n\nIt took forever.  I mean when the women at the counter said 25 minutes, she meant 35+.  (Opening day, I can't take much issue with this.  However, I do feel as if no place should open until they are ready.) I think she may be one of the owners.  Nice lady, but you could see she was exhausted from the initial opening of the establishment.  \n\nIn any case, we ordered the Samosas, which they were out of.  Instead, we ordered the Onion Bhajis.  What we received were the Vegetable Pakoras.  They were really good.  Crispy and light, yet still dense and fulfilling.  The cilantro sauce was awesome.  Spicy and just tart enough.  \n\nFor our entrees, my husband ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala ($15) as he always does.  We think this was another mix up, because quite frankly it wasn't very creamy and it had way too many peppers and onions in it, which leads me to believe it was the Chicken Jalfrazi.  That would explain the extra spiciness that one usually does not find in Tikka Masala.  \n\nThey have you order by #.  Which I think is going to be kind of challenging given the goofs we have experienced thus far.  Again, first day...\n\nI ordered the Lamb Korma ($16).  Oh my goodness, it was wonderful.  The lamb was tender and falling apart.  The sauce was very flavorful and had just the right amount of heat so I could feel a bit of sweat building up on my chin.  Yummmy!  I loved mine, a lot.\n\nWe also had some Saffron Rice ($4).  It was tasty too.  Nothing special, it's rice after all.  \n\nThere prices are a bit more expensive than our usual India Palace, but the portions are substantially larger.  Allowing more than enough for leftovers.  Except for the rice, if two want leftovers the next day, order 2 sides of rice.  \n\nFinal verdict, I will definitely go back for some more and dine in this time as I need to make an update on the floor service.\n\nThe interior is lovely, but the lighting was a bit too bright when we were there.  Also, they should have had some fabric draped from the ceilings as it would have make a marked difference to the level of coziness and warmth.  \n\nP.S.  daily lunch buffet, if you're into that kind of thing...", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Ahhh... sooo much opportunity... the only Indian food in Henderson area!  They could make a killing!  We've waited so long!

We get seated and order some chaat - which was OK but not as good as I remember it.   Fine.  We tried to order the Samosas too (like the first review) but they were still out... after 3 days?  Indian restaurant with no samosas?  Its like peanut butter and no jelly!   Turner and no Hooch! \n\nAhh... let's move on.  We also ordered a full dish of Tandoori Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala curry.   The food comes out relatively fast - but we had the same problem as the first reviewer - the curry had no curry!  Normally the complaint is too much sauce, no meat.  This was all meat, onions and peppers, and a tiny bit of curry.  That would have been OK, but the meat was... tough?  \n\nTough, over cooked meat?  I can't even remember the last time I ever had overcooked chicken in a restaurant.  Maybe at some backyard BBQ when they forgot to check on it after 30 minutes, but not in a restaurant!  Not for a $15 dish!!  Dry, tough chicken, yuck.\n\nThe full dish of Tandoori Chicken for $15 is big.  SO BIG, it barely fits on the serving plate.  That's cool and all, but I'm making a mess just trying to get food off the plate.  Plus, the Tandoori is DRY TOO!  WTF!!  It's supposed to be succulent and appetizing and yummy.  Instead we're both depressed and barely touch either dish.  We get it to go for lunch tomorrow.  \n\nI wake up the next day and what do I find my SO doing?  Cooking lunch.  She wont even take this stuff to work.  She'd rather spend 2 hours cooking something than eat that meal.  *sigh*.  Such high hopes!\n\nSorry Taza.  Please, learn how to cook the chicken?

My hubby and I have been here a few times, and even brought other friends out here who loved it! Firstly, the food is really fresh which is important. The pieces of meat they serve are big cubes, the flavors are bold and remind me of how my family cooks. We've tried their lunch buffet which has a really big variety of veg and non-veg food, I love that they bring fresh naan to your table! I have to say that we tried their veg samosa  and it was one of the best we've ever had, crispy on the outside and piping hot on the inside. I think i even dreamed about their mango lassi, it's so good. We've tried a variety of their chicken dishes and while they do an amazing murgh makani (butter chicken) last night we tried their chicken kadai (chicken with green peppers and onions) and my hubby LOVED it! I was craving aloo parantha (a bread stuffed with potatoes and peas)  and saag paneer (spinach and cheese cubes) and it blew me away. In fact, the food is even better the next day!  The service is amazing, and everyone is really nice. They remember us from previous visits and that makes it more special when we eat there. Unlike other indian restaurants where we've waited 10-15 minutes to even get water, here they serve you drinks immediately. Also, I would give them an extra star because they are one of the few indian places that serve ras malai which is hands down my favorite dessert in the world.

To my surprise, he returned with a yes; however, the chef needs a day in advance to prepare it. Definitely returning soon just for that dish alone. In lieu of Chicken 65, the chef recommended Chicken Kadai, which turned out to be excellent. On a heat scale of 1-10, I ordered an 8 and it was perfect. It was flavorful and saucy.  \n\nIn addition, for our main courses we ordered Indian food staples such as Biryani, Chana Masala, and Tandoori Chicken. Biryani can be difficult to make correctly especially if you have eaten a lot homemade Biryani. It was the perfect complement to the other dishes. The portion was ideal since we were all sharing. \n\nThe Chana Masala very tasty. The garbanzos were cooked perfectly and over all was very good. . We ordered a whole Tandoori Chicken which is enough for four people. It was brought to us on a sizzling platter.

Even though it averages 4 stars here on Yelp, there was always something about the reviews that made me a little tentative.   Well, that and the non buffet prices.\n\nWhat is it about Indian restaurants and their dinner prices?  They always seem about $3-$4 more expensive per entree than I expect.  Compared to most of their lunch buffet or lunch special bargains, it drives me a little crazy to go to one for dinner and get much less food for a lot more money.  This type of thinking is why my pants I just picked up from Men's Wearhouse barely fit, but I digress.\n\nI ordered the Veggie Samosas which is one of my standards I judge any indian restaurant on, some plain naan, and goat curry spicy 7 out of 10 (love this scale!).  I asked if the curry came with rice, and I was told no, but that I could do a combo of 1/2 rice and 1 naan.  Sure, sounds like exactly what I need.  When I arrived, my total bill was $29.  Now the curry was $16 and the Samosas were $5 (according to their website) so I guess the naan and rice cost $7 or so? (shrug)\n\nStarted with the curry over the rice first.   The curry had a nice flavor, it was thick, smoky, and the spice level was perfect.  On top of the rice or being sopped up with the naan (the naan was about what I expect, which is a good thing), either way made me happy.   The goat was tasty, but there were a LOT of bones and pieces of fat and cartilage throughout which was a bit of a buzzkill. It was rare to be able to get a bite of meat without having to constantly spit out a small chunk of something (best visual ever, I know).   I actually would have ultimately preferred it with JUST the curry sauce by the end of my plate.\n\nThe samosas were very large and perfectly shaped with a great flaky crust.  Honestly it almost seemed a little too perfectly made which had me wondering if it was homemade or not (I have no way of knowing honestly, it's quite possible it is).  They tasted fine on the inside, but I found the outside to be overly salt or peppered or both.  I'd honestly never had a samosa with so much seasoning on the outside of it, and my fingers were covered in spice whenever I'd pick it up to eat it which I wasn't used to..   The green sauce it came with was good, wasn't so much a fan of the red.  Overall a good version, though I prefer Factory's or Mt Everest's.\n\nFinal conclusion is that I enjoyed my meal overall, though I wouldn't exactly say it was worth the price I paid in total.   I did get leftovers out of it which softened the blow a little.  I think I'll stick with Samosa Factory and Mt Everest to satisfy my Indian cravings, though if I'm ever in a dire need for some curry in Henderson (it happens.

I read the series of Yelp reviews and even recall a few friends stating it was a good place for curry. I have to presume, it was a bad night for the team at Taj Palace. As much as it pains me to write a \"negative\" review, I have to be true to my experience. We arrived on Friday evening around 8:30 pm. The Yelp reviews for Taj were higher than Ping Kao 3 my intended destination.  Upon arrival I noticed the large dining room had a total of three occupied tables.  The friendly waiters greeted and seated our party of two promptly. To make a long story bearable I will cut to the chase. I ordered a medium butter chicken, at $17.00 I anticipated a fantastic dish. My Partner, ordered a $16.00 lamb dish. He will write his own review.  To our amazement, the two dishes did not come with Naan or Rice. We ordered these items on the side. The plain basmati rice was $5.00 and the Naan was $3.50.  The food came out within ten minutes. Have to give an A for speed and service during the pre-dinner service. This team was on top of it. There were four servers for our table. Our water was never empty and the empty or unused plates/utensils disappeared quickly. So on to the food. I will only speak to my own dish. I have had several butter chicken (Murgh Makhani) dishes at different places. I am familiar with the expected flavor. This particular dish just did not taste like any butter chicken; I have had in the past. The color of the dish looked proper but the flavor was off. It almost tasted as if they used mayonnaise instead of cream or yogurt in the dish. It was slimy and did not have a good flavor at all. To supplement the flavor the meat within the dish was chopped into small bits. There were also chunks of bone, fat and bay leaf. It was just awful. Some might say, you should have sent it back. I have warded off sending any dishes back at restaurants, there are too many horror stories.  I simply did not finish it. The post-dinner service left us sitting with dirty dishes for twenty minutes. When the two waiters finally collected the plates they did not ask about our experience and did not notice most of my butter chicken was still in the dish.  I do not expect anyone to read my mind. It had to be a bad night.  Maybe, I will try again in the future.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "OK, first a disclaimer.

The waiter asked how spicy (mild, medium, spicy) and I said medium. When the food game, it looked nice, but there was very little flavor and no spiciness I could detect. It wasn't horrible, but I've enjoyed Indian food in mall food courts more than the food at Taj Palace.\n\nThe service started off great (four waiters taking care of the two of us), but we were oddly left for 20 minutes after we'd finished out food with not a waiter in sight.\n\nAlso the booths were rickety!

So your not eating chutney, but just some stale mustard sauce.\nThe food is so lame, I dont know what to say. But the perfect recipe to fool Americans and desperate Indians.

Woodlands is a vegetarian South Indian restaurant located in Chandler, Arizona about 20 minutes south of Phoenix.\n\nWhen we arrived, we immediately realized it wasn't all I thought it would be. Located in a strip mall, it was a tiny little take-out joint with inside seating for about 20. We took a look at the menu and were pleased to see items that were marked \"vegan\" so we ordered and took a seat at a booth. The restaurant had a plain interior with cheap tables and black chairs. Towards the back, there was a toppings bar with lots of options. We chose the hot peppers to add to everything we had ordered and waited for our food.\n\nWe started with the Iddly steamed rice and lentil cakes. These plain, mostly flavorless cakes were served with a somewhat-runny sauce that left much to be desired. That's not to mention that everything was served on styrofoam plates, which I only tend to see in cities in the middle of nowhereland. So weird.\n\nFor our entrees, we ordered two curries. I had the Vegetable Curry that had green beans and cauliflower in a coconut-tomato-based curry. My friend ordered the Dhall Curry, which had lentils with mustard, cumin, and spices. Neither of them were anything special.  And we also asked for super spicy, but they weren't spicy at all.\n\nWe also ordered the Parotta Kurma, which turned out to be really odd. They took the bread and sliced it up into pieces, then put a red curry on it. The bread was chewy and slightly spicy, but just odd.\n\nAll in all, it wasn't worth the drive out. The guy at the counter wasn't very helpful or personable. The meal was mediocre at best. And the entrees at $8.50 each really could be priced less for what we received.

I usually eat dosa and South Indian fare at Woodlands (Ray and Rural). I tried Cafe Krishna for a change. I was disappointed. The service was lousy. The waitstaff was not rude and in fact they were very friendly but the wait was too long. We ordered an appetizer and two dosas. They took a 30 minutes to bring us our appetizer and another 30 minutes (1 hour) before we got our dosa. It was not busy when we ordered. There were only 3 couples in the restaurant at the time and they had 3 waiters. They never checked on us and we had to flag them down to get our bill. One of the waiters is an Eastern European woman who spoke no English and had never waited tables before. She brought our chaat to our table and didn't even bring plates with it.\n\nThe food itself was good but not noteworthy. Their chutneys were not tasty or flavorful. The coconut chutney at Woodlands is a lot better. The dosa had very little sabji (potato) filling and was nearly entirely just one large crepe. The dosa at Woodlands includes much more sabji. I did like the sabji and thought it was better than Woodlands because it was slightly less greasy. The samosa chaat was not good. It had very little samosa (maybe two small pieces of one samosa)  and the rest of it included vegetables. It wasn't bad but neither was it tasty.\n\nThe only positive aspect to the place was it's ambience. Despite its \"cafe\" name, the place is a sit-down restaurant. It's nicer than many full fledged Indian restaurants in the valley. It was clean, spacious with many booths. and decorated well. You are seated, given a menu and a waiter takes your order. It's not like Woodlands in which you order at the register. It has a full menu but it's vegetarian. It's also a South Indian place so I wouldn't recommend ordering saag paneer and North Indian dishes because South Indians don't know how to cook North Indian food. \n\nI will not come back because the service was too slow. Even when we flagged our waiter for our bill, there was another couple who had sat for 15 minutes and had not even had their drink orders taken. Honestly, why would I wait an hour to eat Dosa when I can go up the street and eat at Woodlands and get the same quality dosa in 10 minutes. I'm pretty forgiving of slow service if the restaurant is super busy or if there is only one server but this was different. You could tell the waiters had no previous experience waiting tables and had no sense of urgency. They didn't know how to refill drinks, check up on you, bring your bill to you on time.

I wasn't a big fan of the pakora curry (or \"light cream colored mystery blob\" to some), it was a bit too sour tasting.

Lentil soup was soft yellow color, not darker lentils I'm used to. It was creamy with very small pieces of lentils. The flavor was more mild than I'm used to, but a subtle spicy. It was nice, no complaints. The sesame naan was fresh, crisp bottom, soft top layer, added a bit of salt and WOW delicious!! Lots of sesames on top, yum.\n\nThen ordered chicken tikka masala, as I'm working my husband into such foods, and he for sure likes this dish. Nice white breast meat which he prefers, simmered in that divine red creamy sauce. I'd call it mild heat at best.

It's all I want to eat, all day long, and I just can't get enough. All my friends have learnt not to get in the way of me and my curry. Luckily Edinburgh has curry houses a-plenty to help me get my fix, so many in fact that it's easy to get overwhelmed and just order from your closest restaurant time and time again. Well, if your closest restaurant is not Bombay Bicycle Club and you haven't yet given it a go, you must promise me you will. I spent a month this Summer in India giving in to all my curry cravings, and when my friends wanted to go for an Indian 2 days after I was back in Edinburgh, I was really nervous about whether I'd enjoy it, or whether comparisons with the Mother Land would leave me in tears. The BBC was incredible - authentic, full of traditional spices and serious about its menu.\n\nI ordered the Marco Polo chicken from the chef's recommendations section of the menu (not a traditional curry name I know, but wait til you eat - you just won't care). It was rich, well-spiced, tangy and saucy, with beautifully marinated chicken strips which were huge. All of my friends were similarly impressed with what they ordered - so much so no-one offered anyone else a taste, being so happy and protective of their own! The restaurant itself is bright and light, and the service was fine; nothing to rave about, but the food most certainly is. It's not the cheapest curry on the block, with traditional curries being at least \u00a39 for chicken and the chef's specials \u00a310, but the taste and ingredients are definitely worth splashing out for.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "We visited Bombay Bicycle Club last week, as a 2 year anniversary hurrah! following up with some good old Fringe fun.

I am not entirely convinced it was worth it. \n\nI started with vegetable samosas - that looked like they came out of Costco - pretty forgettable. The boy's prawn puri looked much more (and tasted) much better than my option - it's normally my staple, so I was pretty envious as I looked at my sad samosas. For the main, the boy went for the Marco Polo chicken which he devoured happily, and I had the tandoori trout. Lovely seasoning on the trout, but cooked a little too dry. We also shared the Afghan chickpeas, which were pretty delicious as an accompaniment. Naan was too dry and toasted. \n\nNow, I've given it two stars... for why? Well, food-wise, while the main was pleasant, the starter I had was just... eh. I need to find a better word for eh, but at the moment, that's all I can come up with. The mains were pleasant, but in terms of comparing to another restaurant, it isn't food that stands out as memorable, or particular adept at handling the flavours that can be oh-so-amazing or delivered with a blunt hammer.

I wanted some kheem (traditional Indian lamb curry).  Waiter decided to educate me on what \"kheema\" is... Then he told me that they had minced lamb, but wanted to know what curry/sauce I wanted it with.  I asked... I picked one and he told me that I should try something else... He suggested another dish... Which I said I don't enjoy. He told us that if I had it in America, then I should still try it here, as Americans don't know how to cook (2 of us are American, so this too did not go over well).\n\nWe finally finished ordering and the drinks arrived... No water, or glass of ice...so we asked about it and were told to be patient and that it was coming.\n\nA little while later, our papad (poppodum) was brought out.

The samosas (3, with a selection of 3 sauces) were crispy on the outside with fluffy and flavorful fillings.  The mains were amazing, particularly the karahi.  The karahi had so much flavor but without filling heavy.  It was plenty spicy in a way that had just enough heat to wake you up, but not so much to cover the other flavors or make you reach for something to cool off your tongue.  The naan was huge - the size of my head.  Perhaps I'm just accustomed to other restaurants that cut it into peices rather than presenting it in on big piece, but I've never seen naan this large.  It was crispy on the bottom and fluffy on top, delicious.\n\nThe food definitely deserves 5 stars.  The service, not so much.  It started off well, but even when we'd cleaned our plates (and yes, there were no morsels, not even of sauce left), and there was nothing left in our glasses, it took several minutes to get the attention of any staff to ask for the check.

Gravity is awesome, see it or buy it, 'nuf said...going off topic.  We both felt incredibly lucky to find Shezan--well, my girlfriend already knew about it; I just let myself by guided, which is...OK.  \nShezan claims to be an Indian restaurant but it may be too trendy to be one.  It's a colossal bistro with intentionally mismatched white and black chairs divided among polished wooden tables spaced generously but seemingly chaotically about the floor.  Huge photos plastered on the walls offer the impression that I should be trying on a pair of designer Armani slacks.  There's actually glitter on the walls, that's how flashy this place is.  It didn't look cheap.  I didn't see a buffet anywhere; in fact, I couldn't see a single hallmark of Indo-Canadian cuisine.  The menu confirmed those suspicions, offering numerous items seldom seen in Western restaurants.  The biggest surprises were the prices.  They weren't expensive.  Even taking conversion into account, I'd say Shezan was downright reasonable.  They even offered a three course pre-theater menu for 17.50, or about $30 Canadian, and with that you get a lot of food.  \nI know I'm losing your interest.  I should be nitpicking or exasperating a minor quibble into a huge crisis.  I'll soon mention the food, which will convince most people in the area to try out Shezan if they haven't already.  I could carp on their portion sizes being perhaps a tad TOO generous, but what kind of criticism is that?  \nWe opened our meal with a poppadom and pickle tray and followed that with butter chicken and chicken biryani, the latter a virtual unknown dish in Canada.  We also ordered a peshwari nan which is a naan bread made with coconut milk.  I thought I had good naan, but peshwari makes previous naan feel like that slightly depressing opening act before the Blue Man Group takes the stage.  (I'm sorry, that's the only band I've ever seen in person on stage.)  \nHowever, the portions were so large we were both unable to completely finish our plates, precluding the opportunity to take in a dessert, which we both badly wanted to try.  Not for any unique Indian dish mind you, but rather for a couple scoops of moevenpick ice cream.  It was winter and I didn't care; I wanted ice cream.  My girlfriend and I made guesses about what the other would order.  I would have tried the white chocolate and caramelita, though the pistachio and maple walnut looked pretty good to.  Unfortunately we didn't order any of them, an issue worthy of mention again.  I appreciate the desire to make us satisfied but it looks like more and more restaurants are perhaps making us TOO satisfied, preventing us from making it three courses instead of two.  I'm just saying I would have paid for ice cream if the meal portions were a tad smaller.  \nI know, I'm waiting to be tarred and feathered by a mob of overweight Americans who would then promptly try to devour me for looking like oversized chicken in a black polyester longcoat.  And I do acknowledge my reaction upon discovering the 12-inch poppadom, a stretch of starch eclipsed by the naan which followed.  I was overjoyed by such generosity.  The final bill came to a few pence over 30 pounds, making it cheaper for two people than an average under-posh meal in my home town.  \nA final word, once again I paid with a card and once again there was no tip option.  Since I had no cash on hand, I couldn't drop down a few bills for the exceptional service provided.  I felt like crap afterwards.  They totally deserved gratuity.

We checked out the menu before hand, and saw that they have fairly expensive offering - main courses for $25+, vegetarian dishes for $15+, so we had reasonable expectations of a decent meal.  \n\nWhen we arrived at 6:30pm, we see that the restaurant is basically empty. There's only one other table. I felt something was wrong, but then I thought may be it's too early for Vegas and people are not coming in yet (I was wrong!).\n\nI was debating the Okra vs. Veg. Biryani, so I asked the waitress what kind of vegetables they have in the Biryani. She said \"peas\". So, rice and peas for $19.00? What? Is that even a meal? OK, so we ordered the Paneer for Appetizer, Okra and Lamb Curry as main courses, and Nan and rice (which is also rice and peas, but for $9.00).\n\nThe paneer came, and I know we shouldn't have come. It was basically dry and have very little favor. It tasted more like paper than cheese. When the waitress came with our main course, she blatantly commented that she has no idea who ordered which dish (there were only 3 tables!).  Well, you could have handled that by saying \"Lamb?\". Obviously its her first day. Though I have to admit she doesn't have many customers to practice her skills.\n\nThe Okra was extremely sour. I tried very hard to eat as much as I can as we don't have time for another meal due to a scheduled evening show. I think I ate may be 1/3 of the Okra. It was so sour and dry that I can't figure out whether they are rotten for months or someone had washed their feet with the Okra. Then, I tried some of the Lamb Curry from my wife's dish. The meat tasted more like goo, and the source is more like a puree than a curry, it's just the wrong thing. And, for $26 USD you get a small bowl may be 10cm in diameter (not that we would want any more than what we got). The rice was below average (couldn't taste too much of it because of the sour Okra). The Nan was OK, and its the only thing they didn't mess up.\n\nIn the middle of dinner, another waitress came by with beer and asked if we had ordered beer. We did not - there are like three tables at that time, how can you possibly mess that up? Getting the check was really slow too, but I don't care too much about that. \n\nThe final bill + tips was over $80.00, which is the most expensive meal we had in Vegas until that point, and the worst we've had in many years. It's simply worse than some of the very average Indian cuisine you can find in California. (We had a $130+ meal the next day at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant which is reasonably worth it).\n\nFinally, I have to say this place fits exactly into the definition of Gordon Ramsey's Hell's Kitchen - highly over priced, clueless front of house, food lack of favor, and above all, no customers and hemorrhaging cash.

Me and a friend of mine from LA, went there. The place is not for the someone looking for a cheap Chinese buffet where you need a food taster on a retainer, to see you will survive the ordeal.  \n\nAlmost all the Chinese restaurants in Vegas are filthy and dirty rat holes except for the Panda express outlets, exposed on a daily basis, by Chanel 13 TV. They are swarming with cockroaches (I saw one was as big as King Kong, sitting cross legged.on an easy chair ) The meat  is not brought at traditional butcher or reputable supply houses or suppliers, but from unknown sources and no one has any idea which animal it came from. Then the illegal Chinese workers live in the kitchen and bathe in the kitchen and they also double as cooks, dishwashers and cleaning staff and they are closed for cleaning one day a year. A disability and life insurance is a good thing before eating in there. The only word they speak is \"Enjoy\" which sounds like an order to be complied.. if not the fortune cookie will have even sterner message in broken English,.\n\nIn this restaurant, I prefer to order fish Kabob, since they are more North Indian than South. The kabob is a dry item and the cooking process removes any kind of fish aroma.. I suggested this to my friend who devoured this so much he came back with his family few months later and ate to the hearts content.\n\nThe food is fresh and healthy and you have to know what to order, not to mention you are paying three times the price for the luxury of dining inside a casino and the overhead is three time higher than a strip joint. \n\nThe chicken pakora is another delicacy that is perfect as an appetizer when you are relaxing with a chilled red wine. The place was called Gaylord before and the decoration was awful and the newer remodeling is nothing to brag about. The eatery is too well lighted for my tastes and loses the romantic appeal that you seek when you are paying this kind of money but the fish kabob is just out of this world.\n\nOther dry items i like is the tandoori assortment with fish, chicken and shrimp of course the mango kulfi and pistachio kulfi  that is delectable if served like an ice cream not like a hard cake.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I went in here with a friend for their lunch buffet.

Indian food is one of my favorites and I was very excited to find a semi-upscale Indian restaurant in a Vegas casino, but what a disappointment. I think we might have made a mistake going for dinner though. In my experience, Indian restaurants are typically better for the lunch buffet.\n\n1. Service- I'm not really sure whether to complain about service or not. We were not really ignored, but at the time we were the only ones in the restaurant so not that hard. I also felt like the wait staff was trying to push me to spend more money the whole time. They asked if I wanted an appetizer 3 times, asked if I wanted a bottle of wine rather than a glass a couple times, asked if I wanted to add sides or extra bread and weren't clear if they would be extra charge. Just slightly annoying. Also my entree was pretty spicy and they kept letting my water go empty (again, we were the only ones there)\n\n2. Food-  I ordered the goat masala, which was one of the 3 or 4 items under the menu section \"specialties\". When I see this in a restaurant I usually assume they mean these are their best dishes, the ones they are known for. The rice was pretty good. Its pretty hard to mess up rice. The naan bread was also pretty good. The sauce was a little spicier than I expected, but I liked it (and they did offer a milder version). The problem was the meat. I've never had goat before, but there has to be a better cut than what we were served (my dad got the same thing as me). It was some of the toughest meat I've ever had, and there were maybe 2 or 3 bites that were free of fat or gristle. The pieces all had a big bone in the middle and smaller bones throughout. I kept accidentally biting down on them and hurting my teeth. The masala also had no vegetables in it just meat and sauce which was disappointing, to me at least.\nThe worst of it though was how I felt afterwards. I don't want to say that it made me sick, but I spent a considerable amount of time late that night and the next day on the toilet, and I wasn't hungry the whole next day.\n\n3. Price- The reason this place is getting the worst possible score. For two people, one glass of wine each and then water the rest of the time, entree with no appetizer, no desert it was $83.00. Add a 15% tip and you are getting close to $100. I am used to paying that kind of money to eat on the strip, but I expect a certain level of quality and service for that price, and it was not met here.\n\nBottom line is that I am not going back and I would not recommend it to anyone. At least stay way from the goat.", "review_stars": 1, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "They had lots of selections so I really didn't have to try everything.

I got tap water which.  She then said they had a buffet and I replied that was the reason I was there.  She gestured for me to go ahead and start and she'd get my naan.\n\nThe buffet is small by comparison to other Indian buffets in town.  There are 8 hot dishes, some salad, and achaar.  It was a good enough choice and the good taste of the food made up for the limited selection.\n\nThe naan was buttered generously and was a welcome addition to the meal.\n\nFor my first trip, I got chicken tikka masala, malai kofta, and some basmati rice.  The thing I noticed about all of their dishes was they all had a nice spicy flavor.  It's not overpowering for people who like mild food but it had a definite tang and it was not just one dish but all of them.  It was the first time I know that I had malai kofta and it was really a treat!  The last thing was the vegetable pakora.  This was a bit disappointing.  I didn't read the full description because I know what it is.  The only vegetable I could see/taste was potato.  It seemed more like it was a pakora made from bread stuffing and some potato.\n\nFor the second plate, I had aloo matar, daal maharani, and curry chicken.  The aloo matar and curry chicken were good.  The daal was OK.  The sign said spicy lentils but this was the only dish that was lacking in spice.  There were some beans mixed in the daal, too.\n\nFor dessert I got some rice pudding and some carrot pudding.  The rice pudding was not labeled as kheer and it had a lot of liquid with less rice unlike kheer or rice puddings I've had before.  The carrot pudding, on the other hand, was very thick and unlike the carrot puddings I've had elsewhere.  Both puddings were very good--I'm not criticizing them but merely pointing out the different preparation.  I wish I had seen the achaar at the beginning of my meal.  I didn't think it would be as tasty with dessert!\n\nService as I said was very good.  When I went for my second plate, my dirty plate was removed and my water glass refilled.  The server was very pleasant.  The room is quite nice and it was very quiet.  \n\nThe price is just over $16 including tax.  For the limited selection, it's higher than most places.

Our hosts usually offer us our choice of plain or garlic naan - or even both.

A co-worker of mine agreed to join me (ditching his diet) thanks to the fact that Shari S had described the Naans here as being \"billowy.\" We made the long 10 mile trudge to Mt Everest from the office. \n\nThis buffet is seriously amazing. For a little tiny place charging 8.99 per person, it seriously hit every craving and made us happy campers. There is an extensive vegetarian selection in the buffet: soft Basmati rice with peas, Palak Paneer, Punjabi Kadi, Malai Kofta, Dhal, Cauliflower and Potato Stirfry, Sambar, Idly, Samosas, Pakoras and a myriad of chutneys, yogurt, salad and dips. I have only good things to say about every single dish on the buffet. Tasted good and the ingredients were all fresh. Indian buffets frequently omit primo dishes like Paneer (indian cottage cheese cubes), Kofta (indian dumplings in gravy), Samosas and fresh (not frozen) veggies in their food. Mt. Everest did no such thing...they spared no expense and made this buffet experience fantastic. \n\nMy co-worker who eats meat couldn't stop raving about the creamy Chicken Makhani, Lamb Curry and the Samosas (he went pretty crazy with all the chutneys). \n\nAnd yes, the garlic naans that came with the buffet (we asked for garlic) were billowy. And extremely tasty. \n\nMy only gripe with Mt. Everest is the dessert selection. They had sweet rice...which really is a cop-out dessert. But I settled for their fresh fruit selection (oranges and watermelon). I would give these guys a 4.5 stars (taking off a half star for the dessert) but since I can't on Yelp, they get a four. Next time, if they serve Gulab Jamun I will be more than happy to up it to a no-questions asked 5 star review.\n\nIt's truly heartwarming to see an Indian buffet keep it's quality consistent even after being open a while.

He was Asian, but not Indian, and I could barely understand a word he was saying.  I thought he might be Nepalese, and it turned out I was right.  I don't think he's been in the desert long enough to be dealing with customers, since his English was unintelligible.

I like being able to taste a little of everything.  We ordered the Special Mt. Everest Thali and also a Vegetable Biryani.\n\nAlmost everything on the Thali was terrific.  The appetizer plate came with one very large veggie Samosa, a bunch of very small pakoras, some pieces of ground mean whose name I can't remember, and boneless Tandoori chicken.  We were full before the Main Event.\n\nThen came the Thali platter.  On a Thali, the dessert is right there on the platter, along with the food.  It was supposed to be Gulab Jamun, which is not a favorite.  But instead, there was kheer - the rice pudding - and it was the most watery kheer I'd ever tried.  We asked if we could have kulfi instead, and were cheerily obliged.\n\nThe only other problem with the meal was the Raita.  Every Indian restaurant makes it differently, but this one was special:  especially AWFUL!  It was watery, tasted a bit sweet, and just downright peculiar.  Nevertheless, we packed it up along with our other leftovers.  When we opened the container the next night it was FIZZY.  It got the boot immediately.\n\nThe biryani was a huge portion of rice.

My husband and I got there before the other couple joining us (it is one of their favorite restaurants).  The staff immediately greeted and seated us.  We had a few moments to look around...decor is a bit dated with the dark green upholstery, but well kept.  We ordered a bottle of wine from the limited but reasonably priced popular wines.  Once the other couple arrived, they were immediately recognized as familiar faces by the staff.  \n\nPrior to ordering we were served complimentary papadoms with the tradition mint and tamarind chutneys. We ordered Tandoori Chicken as an appetizer. This is a great value given there were atleast 8 pieces.  It came out sizzling hot, serve on a cast iron skillet.  I wanted to love it as its sight and sound captured my senses, but it was missing that aromatic smell.  That is right, it was not aromatic or flavorful...kind of bland for Tandoori, but nothing offensive and definitely well prepared.  Still worth getting, because it comes out fresh and sizzling, just spritz with lemon and sprinkle  salt it is more than fine.  \n\nShortly after our main dishes came out--palak paneer, chicken tikka, rogan josh, garlic naan, and a side kachumber salad.  First off, the portions were plentiful, and more than enough to feed four hearty adult appetites and two for lunch the next day.  The palak to the palak paneer makes that dish silky, creamy and very comforting, but could use a bit more spice although it was ordered at a level 6 on spice scale (1 to 10).  The chicken tikka was tasty and familiar in the sweet, tomatoey style...I prefer it slightly less sweet, but again, well made and worth trying.  The rogan josh's flavor was complexly layers and my favorite dish; it almost like my moms!  However, we ordered it at a level 10 spiciness, but it was much milder than expected.  Although I don't eat bread, according to my fellow dinners the garlic naan was fresh, warm and soft.   The kachumber salad was standard.  \n\nThroughout our meal,  the manager/owner(?) kept checking to make sure we were satisfied and of course, asking if we wanted more wine once we finished the bottle we order.  He gave us generously filled glasses for $5, and we had a friendly conversation.  \n\nOverall, the food was prepared with quality ingredients and with care, but lacked a bit of seasoning.

Their service is hospitable, kind of quiet and shy, but hospitable nonetheless. \n\nTheir Mango Lasse is amazeballs. Their chai is alright, probably wouldn't order it again though.

I have been back like, 7 times in the past month since that initial visit.  It is by far my favorite Indian lunch buffet place.  I had 3 in the running but Mt Everest is on top.  First, the price.  I believe it is 10.99... not bad.  Second, the choices.  It has the most choices I've seen!  What could make this place better?  If their labels were more specific.  I love the way some buffets put \"vegetarian\"; as a 75% vegetarian I like a quick reference guide to vegetarian options.  But... with my minor knowledge of Indian food I know what most of their dishes are.  If it were my first exposure to Indian food, however, I would be S.O.L!\n\nAlso another thing they could make better.  Their naan.  I don't like their naan.  I like buttery, garlicy soft guusy naan.  This is not my favorite place for naan (Saffron is).  If you like medium-textured, little buttered, barely garlic-ed naan then you would like it.  Other than that, it's so good!   Their choices are amazing.\n\nFinal thing (this is the Nutrition student in me):  They are so sanitary!  One of the only Indian buffets I've seen with in-place \"sneeze guards\" on their buffet.  Their buffet is actually buffet style so it has the coverings.  Furthermore, their bathroom has a sanitary spray above the handle.  How great!

The lunch buffet is served in some of the nicest heated tables (one iced table for the cold menu) with covered chafing dishes.  The food is kept hotter than any other buffet with dishes refreshed regularly.  The one meat table is separate from the vegetable tables, a nice feature for vegetarians to avoid cross contamination.\n\nEvery dish was delicious.  Although I would have liked to have one main potato dish (there were potato samosas and a great mixed vegetable dish with potatoes) and would drop up to half a star for the menu selection, the food was fresh, perfumed, and not overly South Indian hot.  The obligatory Tandoori Chicken was both flavorful and moist.  I suspect that the heated tables and covered chafing dishes help maintain the quality of the food.  The pakora were a little crunchy, maybe not perfect, but tasty.  Given that there are no half-stars, the only negatives were not worthy of dropping to four stars considering our overall satisfaction.\n\nWe arrived for a late lunch, around 1:30, but the food was great and refreshed before the dish was emptied, keeping the quality up.  The plain naan arrived before we were back from the buffet and I would have liked to have garlic naan, but no one asked.  I guess it is important to ask right away for naan other than plain, but the plain naan was good.  The service was fine with dishes cleared and water refilled, but a little invisible and surprisingly shy.  For any questions, just call out for them -- they really don't want to disturb your meal.\n\nOverall, the fixtures were superior, the dining room was kept clean, and every dish on the buffet was terrific.

All the main dishes are very good also.  Warning though, if you ask for spicy... these dishes can definately make you sweat like a banshsee!! just ask my bf!! I like them milder and ask for mild or a level \"3\" and they are delish.  Maybe \"5\" or higher will be too spicy and possibly not enjoyable... but up to one's palate.  The tandoori chicken comes out on a sizzling plate and the chicken is so tender and tasty, always a safe bet.  The chicken makhani (butter chicken) is my absolute favorite! The korma and curry are pretty rich in spices and have very distinct flavors to the dishes.  I think the palak paneer is alright but reminds me more of creamed spinach - so maybe a pass.  \n\nThis place is small and cozy but usually hopping with customers.

As a result it was just us, and one other table. So ambience was lacking. There was also some awful twangy hawaiin inspired Indian music on in the background, and it was loud enough that we kept noticing and commenting. And last little irk, the waiter practically fell over himself insisting we ordered poppadoms. Which we really didn't want. And had to say NO to several times. Luckily he didn't bring them, but seriously - I know you make mark up from selling fried air at 40p a pop, but I don't want them!\n\nAnyway, the better stuff. The food. The menu is more British Indian than traditional. I appreciate good food in its traditional form, and so prefer restaurants that serve up the closest imitation to straight-from-the-country as it can. There are other Indians in Edinburgh that do this better. But for what it was - British Indian - it seemed ok.\n\nWe both went for the Chicken Shashlik kebab - chicken tandoori with green peppers, onions and tomato. As we ordered the same thing, when it was brought out we assumed the portion in the waiters hand was for both of us to share. He proceeded to dish it onto my friend's plate...and continued serving it ALL until it was gone, and reappeared with a fresh sizzling platter of meat for me. I regretted ordering the boiled rice as 'filler'.\n\nActually that's one other wee thing that irked me. I would have preferred if he'd set the sizzler down beside us and we had helped ourselves, rather than putting it *all* on our plates at once, for us. As a result I ate it all, but perhaps wouldn't have done had it been on the sizzler. A tactic?\n\nAnyway, the chicken itself was a wee bit dry, and the yoghurt tandoori marinade a wee bit chalky, but the vegetables were quite nice - I liked the tomato - and as far as meals go it was finished, and enjoyed. Not outlandishsly wonderful by any stretch, but for 'filling Indian fare' it hit the spot.\n\nBut the best part was the price. That previously mentioned mountain of sizzling meat set me back \u00a38.

The meat dishes were packed full of really great quality meat and there was no stringy, fatty bits on the lamb dish we had, which I do usually find can be an issue.\n\nWe were in the back of the restaurant and it would be fair that we did bring our own atmosphere. Service was good and staff were helpful, but just a bit slow at removing excess bottles and glasses to make way for food which was a wee niggle. \n\nAs this was a buffet, I'm not sure what dishes we had - a chicken korma I think as the cream and coconutty/almondy sweetness gives this away, sag aloo, a mushroom dish, the lamb dish and all sorts of naan's and pilau rice.

And let me say I am very glad we did, what a little gem.\n\nTo start with they were very accommodating of my wee one's large buggy and were very happy to make room for it and most importantly, as all parents can agree, they had a high chair.\n\nWe all opted to go for the set lunch menu which comprises of a starter, main dish curry, rice or nan bread, followed by either vanilla ice cream or coffee... all for just \u00a36.95. I mean that alone just screams to me 'What an amazing deal!'. What is really nice about the lunch menu is that while some places offer you a very limited selection of dishes Morningside Spice allows you a good sized well rounded choice. 6 starter choices, both for the meat eater and the vegetarian. When it comes to your main dish you can have either chicken, lamb or veg and choose from mild, medium, sweet & sour or hot. Throw in the fact that there are then twelve different sauces to choose from you can have no doubt that there will be something for everyone.\n\nNow I went with the Chicken Pakura to start with and I was delighted with the extremely tender pieces of chicken coated in a lovely aromatic batter. It was a perfectly sized lunch time starter accompanied with a nice cooling salad and a lovely dip with just the right amount of spice in it. And it wasn't a pathetic little splodge of sauce on the side either, between the 3 of us we had a good sized bowl of it, so for those of you that enjoy a good dipping you won't be disappointed. \n\nNow as much as I love curries i have to admit i am a bit of a wimp when it comes to things being too hot, i am truly a bit of a girl, so I decided to go with a mild chicken malayan. Between the3 of us we went with two rices and one nan bread which worked out great for sharing as nans where a very good size. \n\nWhen my malayan turned up it came in one of those tradition round metal curry bowls which i really like to see, i mean why go out for a curry if it just shows up on a plain white plate... i can do that at home for any meal. The portion size was just right for lunch time and the peices of chicken were a good size and very tender and again it had a great amount of very yummy sauce, just the right amount for mixing in with the lovely fluffy rice or scooping up with the nan bread.\n\nHaving scrapped my bowl clean of every trace of sauce and then offering to help my mum with a bit of her lovely korma sauce the small scoop of vanilla ice cream that followed was just the perfect way to finish off the meal, especially i imagine if you have been braver than me and gone for one of the hotter curries.\n\nIt was a great meal and I'm definitely planning on going back to try their full menu, along with a few more Cobra beers.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I found the food to be way too greasy compared to what I know from other indian places.

It was a dramatic building, and I had some great food there. \n\nThen it burnt down, and they moved to a fairly boring cellar under the Pear Tree and - I don't know, seemed to lose their way. Sauces were boring and tasted 'out of a jar', and worse, the staff would positively force feed you to get you out fast. But I reasoned to myself that I had gone during the festival and at Christmas, and nowhere is at its best when it's so busy. \n\nFinally, Khushi has its new home, in Antigua Place at the top of Leith Walk. It's taken over a big space that used to be Massimo's (I miss Massimo's), and from the outside it looks bright and cheerful and the place-to-be. \n\nSo last night I called and asked for a reservation for four. They had a table, though we'd have to be out in 90 minutes. That seemed fair, we just wanted a quick meal. \n\nFrom the second we arrived, though, it all went wrong. We were shown into a bare 'overspill' room off to the side, harassed to order fast, and then the unsmiling waiter announced that he'd 'bring your starters and mains at the same time, because you have to be out soon'. Charming...\n\nAnd so he did, slapped everything down and off he went, to practise his lack of social skills on someone else. \n\nThe food was okay, I suppose - fish pakora were tasty, the veg pakora a bit dry for my liking. My tandoori monkfish - I've had it before there and loved it, but last night it was a bit overcooked. And... maybe not actually monkfish? The texture just wasn't quite right so I was suspicious. \n\nAnyway, we ate, we got full. Mostly it was basic British Indian food in over-creamy sauces. And we were finished long before the time they were due to throw us out.\n\nThere are too many good restaurants in Edinburgh to have to put up with actively rude service.

What a disappointment.\n\nI really liked the old Khushi's on Victoria St, unless I'm looking back with rose-tinted taste buds. Certainly the building was beautiful and lent the whole experience a degree of elegance. Well, at least as much elegance as you can muster while staggering up the stairs clutching your plastic bag overflowing with BYOB contributions.\n\nI have fond memories of the food there but it seems a long time now since that place burned down (what's happening with that space, anyway?). I went once to their temporary location where the food was bad and the service worse. I wasn't sure if I wanted to go back but since they opened their new restaurant at the top of Leith Walk, it looked more stylish and back to the original vibe. I was sad to see Massimo close down though, as I was impressed both times I went there. I guess I should have gone more often, but it's a funny location at the top of the walk. Kind of on the way somewhere but neither here nor there. Intermediate but not central (as we say in the geography biz). It works for the cheap and crappy Indian (and other sub-continental) and Italian places there who grab the pre-theatre cheapskates but it's not an easy location to make a go of a high quality (and matching price) establishment. \n\nSo. The new place looks nice from the outside, but inside it feels a bit more like a pile 'em high and sell 'em cheap kind of place. And that's how they treat you. See Gillian's review for more detail. We knew when we booked that we only had 90 minutes, which was fine, but they really rushed us and not in a friendly way. It was just rude. And he told us the starters would come with the mains because we had to be out. Didn't ask us, or make it friendly or anything. Come on, how long does it take to cook, serve and eat a few pakora? As it turned out, we finished with plenty of time to spare. The food was decent. Quite reliable quality but nothing out of the ordinary. And continued rude service throughout the meal.\n\nQ.

There were three dipping sauces - the mint one, a chutney of some sort, and a dark purplish one.  I'm not a particular big fan of tandoori, but the BF ate three pieces of it.\n\n* Lamb Curry \"Cubes of lamb cooked with onions, tomatoes, garlic, red chilies, and pickling spices.\" - It tasted a bit gamey for me, but we did enjoy dipping our nan bread into the sauce.\n\n* Chicken Tikka Masala \"Chunks of boneless chicken roasted in the clay oven and then served in a mild curry sauce.\" - The chicken was white meat, and pretty flavorless.  But the curry sauce was SO good!  I wish I had a bucket of that to dump all over my rice and to smother my nan bread with!  Next time I'll tell them to skip the chicken and give me more of that sauce!\n\n* Kali Dal \"Slow cooked black lentils with a medley of spices.\" The BF thought this would taste just fabulous in a burrito, as in skip the black beans, refried beans, or pinto, and add some black lentils instead.  Pretty tasty stuff and good with the nan bread too.\n\n* Rice - A generous scoop coupled with a few green peas for decoration.  Needed to enjoy all the lovely sauces the meal has to offer.\n\n* Nan \"White flour tandoori bread\" - A must when eating Indian food.  My preferred choice when soaking up any kind of curries, especially those that come with tikka masalas! \n\n* Raita - Condiment based on yogurt used as a sauce or dip.  Served chilled and has a cooling effect when eating spicy dishes.  I'm not a big fan of the raita and was only dumping it on the rice 'cuz the BF was doing it.  I can pass on this.  \n\n* Daily Dessert - Two small donut-like holes sitting in a bath of butter and honey.  Oh so sweet and a nice finish after a hearty Indian dinner.\n\nI ordered up the Buddha's Feast for $21 and this is what I got: \n\n* Vegetable Samosa \"Crisp golden brown pastries stuffed with mildly seasoned potatoes and peas.\" - The order came with two samosas, and two dipping sauces.  The BF was pretty impressed by these, and I'm lucky that I had two to share!\n\n* Malai Kofta \"Chunks of cheese tossed in a mild buttery cream sauce.\" - It came with one chunk of cheese only, which I couldn't even tell was cheese! I thought it was a mixture of chickpeas or something.  The sauce was okay, and good for dipping. \n\n* Saag Paneer \"Spinach with our special cottage cheese cooked in a karahi with house spices.\" - It came with one piece of cottage cheese, and I think it lacked flavor.

Thanks to our server who told us how to eat it. It's fun. Like a shot of mild spice. \n\nThe other dish we had was the dessert which came with the Ashoka's feast. It was made of dried carrot and nuts. Now, I have this weird thing against cooked carrots. They make me gag, but I love raw carrot. It's strange. So anyhow, I was not aware of what this dish, Gajar Halva, was made out of. I asked the waiter. It tasted nothing like carrot. It has this amazing texture and sweetness. I highly recommend it. Like most extra-American dishes, I find that you should eat it without knowing what it is. I think many Americans have preconceived notions of what things should taste like and their texture so knowing what you're eating is more apt to gross you out than allow you to experience it. \n\nOh yea, while the food was excellent here and the service, the Ashoka's feast is not really enough food for two people.

No flavor whatsoever.  The lamb curry on the other hand... was a SPOONFUL of SALT with every bite.  YUCK!\n\nI've never abandoned an Indian meal in my life, no matter how mediocre.  But I could not get myself past even half this meal.  Maybe the bland curry juxtaposed to the salty one made it seem even saltier, or, \"Maybe,\" I thought, \"if i mix the two curries together, I would find a happy medium.\"  How wrong I was! There was no happiness to be found there. :(\n\nTo top it off, when our bill came, we were charged $15 for the \"chicken tikka masala\" instead of butter chicken, and told our server about the mistake.  He said, \"It doesn't matter anyway, they're the same price.\"  Indeed not!  I corrected him and said that the butter chicken is $14.  So he responded, \"Fine, I'll just COMP you the difference.\"\n\n\"COMP\"? \"COMP\"??? Are you kidding me?!  You're not comping us anything!  We're just asking you to charge us for what we ACTUALLY ORDERED!  Don't think you're doing us any favors!\n\nFinally, just to add insult to injury, they advertised 10% off the bill if you showed them the ad from the Vegas 24/7 booklet.

I thought that was a bit harsh and strange as the dining area was a little more than half full already.  The kicker was a group of women that showed up about 15 minutes prior to closing and the same host was taking care and doting over them with open arms.  Guess you have to show some skin, cleavage, possibly more... to override the rules, eh?  \n\nService here on the whole part is excellent.  The food here is excellent and VERY fresh.  However, I highly do recommend not to order spicy as the last dish I ordered was heavily-overpowered with chili powder, but no taste.  Order medium, if you want a kick, but still can enjoy the flavors.  Portions are not big, but that is perfectly fine as they are definitely filling.  The garlic naan is good; samosas are forgettable and not worth it by any means; the korma is great; and I HIGHLY recommend the yellow/cumin rice as a side dish as it is superb. \n\nThe other knock-off is that they automatically added 18% gratuity to the bill.  It's one thing if it was a group of people and I understand that, but for just two people?  At least have a sign at the front desk or something on the menu that says this is going to be enforced.  It has nothing to do with us being cheap tippers or anything as we both vary between 15% to 20% on tipping (dependent on food/service etc...)  I know the last time I went with my boyfriend and a close friend of our's, this did not occur.  Was it because we \"inconvenienced\" them by coming in an hour before closing since the tone of the voice and body language of the host made it obvious?  Bizarre to say the least and this definitely did not go over well with the bf one bit.  The redemption was later on when I won money on the slots at Paris to cover up the dinner cost.   \n\nPricey, yes, but what do you expect in Vegas?  $14 for channa masala (garbanzo beans in a sauce) is hilarious as you can go get a Trader Joe's frozen version of the same thing/taste for around $2 and change.  Expect to pay at least nearly $30 a person to give you a gauge of what to expect.  \n\nUnfortunately, this last experience did not go over well at all, especially with my boyfriend.

While there, we sampled food from several Indian restaurants around town, and were most pleased with what we had at the booth of India Masala, which is permanently located in the Riviera. For the first time we had dosa, a lentil and rice pancake/crepe that is a typical dish of Southern India. We happened to pick up a postcard offering 25% off our check so we decided to head to the Riviera to see what else was being offered.\n\nIt's no surprise that the Riviera is on its last legs, and ranks up there with Circus Circus as being the most rundown hotel on the strip. We certainly worked up an appetite as we made the looooong walk from the parking garage to the food court (next time I'd valet in the front of the casino). No, we weren't expecting Indian Masala to be a semi-fast food restaurant, but as it turns out, it was. The prices aren't really justified considering this, but the food is really good and it was packed with more Indians and convention attendees than any other tenant's space when we were there (see below), so we figured it was safe to stay. We had to wait about in line for five minutes and then another ten minutes or so for our food, which was a bit frustrating, but I felt rewarded when I got my dosa. Today I opted for one stuffed with spinach, the palak dosa ($7.99), but you can also choose from a filling of chickpeas (chole), potatoes (masala), or no filling at all (plain). It is served with what I learned to be the traditional accompaniments, sambar (a vegetable soup) and coconut chutney (imagine a thick and textured almond milk). There is also a third side that I can best describe as a pureed and spiced red bell pepper spread. The dosa is flavorful enough on its own, but the sauces add another dimension and were very much enjoyed. The dosa itself is delicate, with a browned, crisp exterior and a soft, lightly chewy interior. You can get a better idea of the textural difference when you order it plain, but the filling makes it a meal. I must say it's a dish that's growing on me, and I'd bear the pain of walking through that casino to enjoy another one day. My husband was less thrilled with his dish, but it seems to me that the emphasis here is on lesser known Southern Indian cuisine so chicken vindaloo ($11.99) might not have been the best option. This vindaloo was flavorful but not nearly hot enough for Ian who asked them to make it as spicy as possible. The larger problem was the color of the sauce, which was reminiscent of an artificially colored sweet and sour. The color should have been deeper and darker had it been a result of the spices. Things that don't look natural probably aren't, so we'll just say this color most likely wasn't derived from where it should have been.\n\nIf you are interested in trying a new kind of Indian dish that isn't available at other restaurants around town (as far as I know), I would definitely recommend coming here for the dosa. I'd be willing to try a few other things but I think what I had was the most reasonably priced for you what you get, and certainly the most unique.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 3, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "For location and atmosphere this place is 1 star - Located in a bordering-on-skeezy food court at The Riviera.\n\nFood is great however - extremely decent, with some of the hugest and tastiest naan around.\n\nI wouldn't go here over most of the sit down places in town, simply because I want some service and don't like food courts, but if you're trapped at The Riviera this is infinitely better than the rest of the crap they serve up (It sure was depressing to see how the vast majority of people opted for lowest common denominator hamburgers and hot dogs over wonderful Indian cuisine).", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 4, "cool": 4}}, {"text": "Thank you Sheila B. for piquing my interest.

We got 4 tiny (circumference of just over a 5 pence coin) scallops in their shells smothered in sauce which completely overpowered the delicate scallops - 1 star\n\nThe score averages to 2.5 stars. \n\nIt may seem unfair but I had to take away 0.5 for being charged separately for the dips that were served with the poppadums which we hadn't explicitly ordered. \n\nIt could've just been a bad day at the office for the chef and I do hope I am more impressed the next time I visit.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "\\\\ L O C A T I O N \\\\\n\nThe general area of Commercial Street at the bottom of Leith is getting better.

Worked out about \u00a37.50 each with this offer.

Add a bottle of rose and a cola to this and the total for added bits and pieces came to \u00a331 (so pretty much another \u00a38 per person for the Poppadoms & Dips, Half a Naan Bread & Half Rice, a Glass of Wine and a Shot of Cola if we had done so - which is reasonable per person but was quite sneaky regarding the \"chip [poppadoms] & dip\").\n\nHaving said that, \u00a315 per person for what we had was quite good.

I was swithering between three and two stars, but I'm giving it credit for potential.\n\nGuchhi really has the stuff to make itself a hero of Leith, and I regret this will read as a pretty negative review... because instead of one big flaw dragging it down, which I could mention in passing and scoot on by, there are lots of little things that will take longer to talk about, making this probably sound more like a two-star review. So, again, reiterating - it's a really nice place and I liked it.\n\nHowever, it's looking a bit tired on the outside - the door frame is peeling and tattered, but once I got in, I felt myself smile, because it's really quite lovely. Big high ceilings, clever decoration, a very lovely swinging egg chair (I WANT ONE!), warm and toasty, and a general sense of elegance.\n\nWe came on a Groupon deal for four tapas and two cocktails at about \u00a316 (I can't remember the exact amount) and were fully prepared for a lovely seafood feast. However, the waiter swiftly informed us that all fish was off. Shellfish, fine, but no fishywishy. It hadn't come in off the boat. Well, I mean, I thought that the good part of that was that the fish they serve is fresh, but the bad part is that the fish they serve they actually don't serve. The manner in which the news was delivered to us suggested that this is very much standard routine at lunchtimes: half the menu (at least) is out of bounds. O...kay... So I plumped for a clam starter, Sarah L had the mussels, and we both went for a chickeny thing for main.\n\nA big plus point is that my fear with tapas is a lack of size, and with only four between us I thought I would leave very hungry (even though we added some rice and chapatti to our order), but that wasn't an issue here. I had a bit of a job digging around to find the clams inside the shells under all that sauce, but despite their playful game of hide-and-seek, they were plentiful and tasty. My first clam experience! The butter chicken I had for main was nice - I'm not sure I'd pay the price on the menu for it, but it was nice. More my kind of thing than the clams, in fact, since I'm a fan of all things chicken.\n\nIt's also worth noting that we had booked the deal for last week, but they rang up and asked us to change it due to some kitchen issue or other.\n\nThe deal included cocktails, but alas, there was a mocktail fail. I think what I was delivered was actually, basically, just mango juice. It was nice, sure, but the girl had vowed some kind of mocktaily thing.\n\nAh yes, the girl. There were two tables occupied - ours, and another table of two. It's quite a big place, so it's a shame that it was so empty on a Friday lunchtime in such a good location. I guess sometimes I'd be inclined to forgive cold and unsmiling service if a place were heaving with people, thinking \"gosh, it must be so tough to deal with all of these people; I know I could never do this job well\". But really, when there are four people in your restaurant, it's not hard to raise a bit of conversation or at least smile, rather than saying the bare minimum. This wasn't Voucher Treatment (I know some people say they're ill-treated because they come on a voucher) because she was like it from the off, before Sarah presented the voucher. So... she was just naturally mardy.\n\nSo, in summary: no fish dishes (in which they're supposed to specialise), unfriendly and somewhat dilatory service, lame attempt at some kind of non-alcoholic cocktail, BUT nice place, decent food, good portions. I do want to go back, perhaps in an evening, and try it again. Because, like I said, it's lovely - or it ought to be.

It feels like a banquet room. Only two booths, the rest of the expansive room filled with round-top banquet tables, chairs covered in plastic, a little stage in the corner. And COMPLETELY EMPTY.\n\nAn Indian restaurant should smell like, I dunno, Indian food when you walk in. This place didn't. It smelled like ... an old folks' home. Or something. Something not right. And it was dead quiet in there. Not even a TV or radio on.\n\nThere was one person visibly working in the entire place, a middle-aged woman who was helpful enough but not very friendly. You think she'd be thrilled to see even one person, let alone a couple, walk in. Not so. She kind of just gestured toward whatever table we wanted, dropped off menus, and disappeared. Didn't ask us for drinks or anything.\n\nThe menu was typical Indian fare, and prices were about average. We ordered some of our favorites -- veggie samosas, pakora, chicken tikka masala, aloo gobi, as well as some rice and two kinds of naan. At the same time, the host/server/whatever finally took our drink orders. Sadly, this joint doesn't serve alcohol. I hate it when I can't order a good Indian beer with my meal.\n\nIt took a long time to get even our drinks (water and iced tea) out, which came with the appetizers. The samosas were OK. The pakora was weird. I'm used to pakora being similar to tempeh -- just vegetables dipped in batter and fried. These were more like spongy batter balls with diced veggies inside. Maybe they're more \"authentic,\" I don't know, but they sucked.\n\nThe entrees were solid. Nothing to write home (or, um, on Yelp) about, kind of weak-flavored, but decent. The naan was good enough. \n\nWe had a Restaurant.com gift certificate to use, and when the lady first looked at it, she said, \"That's not us.\" She said this because their logo didn't print, and she thought the \"missing image\" graphic was someone else's logo. I had to point out to her the NAME AND ADDRESS AND PHONE of her own business. She did eventually take the discount off our bill.\n\nInterestingly, at some point, a man and his child walked in during our meal, heartily greeted us, and I assume he is the owner or manager at least, which leads me to believe our host/server might have been his wife. Maybe she was grumpy that she had to work by herself while he was watching the Big Game or something. Had he been there when we first arrived, we might have felt better.

When we arrived at around 8PM on a Saturday the large rectangular building was empty with the exception of two other pairs of customers at the round tables in the main part of the room. Down one side there are four half-booths, although only two of these appear to be available for customers, with one having a computer set up upon it and the other, outfitted with a pair of mismatched, padded office chairs appears to be used as a hangout for the proprietor's children when they aren't helping out with the restaurant.\n\nAfter being instructed by a small child to \"just sit anywhere\" we took one of the open booths and another child brought us our menus. The covers looked slightly grubby, like they could have used a wipe down and I noticed a large stain on the side of the booth next door to ours - it looked like someone had spilled a large glass of coke over the side of the table at one point and that it had been allowed to set before washing. Chairs and tables were covered with plastic to ward off such spillages and the plastic on top of our table felt like it could have been a little cleaner also, as could the salt and pepper shakers which felt a little grimy when we moved them.\n\nThe restaurant is a bit odd and has a little raised section in the corner opposite the door and the 1970s disco ball in the middle of the room. The disco ball was just a mystery and I expected to see the four children from The Chronicles of Narnia file in and take their places in the four throne-like armchairs upon the curious dais at any moment. It was an unusual atmosphere.\n\nAfter a few minutes our host arrived with a jug of room temperature water with shrink wrap covering the top. He had collected this from one of the central tables which was home to a collection of such jugs. He seemed very friendly, however, and quickly accepted our restaurant.com certificate and enthusiastically took our order. In order to meet the $35 requirement we ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Malai Kofta, Shahi Paneer, and a selection of Naan (two garlic, one sesame).\n\nOur host then presented us with some pappadums and the usual chutneys of tamarind and mint. The mint chutney had a nice kick to it and although the tamarind had an uncharacteristically odd \"ketchupy taste\" it mellowed into a pleasant aftertaste so it all worked out. We were cheerfully informed that we could ask for more pappadums if we liked and as the host departed I commented to my wife about how the friendliness and enthusiasm was enough to make me overlook some of the oddities of the place in my upcoming Yelp review.\n\nDespite the fact that there were very few others in the restaurant we didn't see any staff again for the forty or so minutes it took for our food to arrive. I wasn't bothered at all by the longer than average wait time and the food more than made up for it anyway. My Chicken Tikka Masala was a little milder than I am used to, however the very nutty and savoury Shahi Paneer was a perfect accompaniment. I found my garlic naan to be tasty without being amazing, but my wife found her sesame naan to be a little overcooked on the bottom. The Malai Kofta was somewhat different to other incarnations of this dish that I've experienced. The sauce tasted more like a onion/butter sauce than creamy, but was tasty, however the kofta themselves were dark, somewhat sharp in flavour and fell to pieces at the merest touch of an eating utensil. Overall though, the food was excellent and we couldn't wait to return and I expected to award the restaurant four stars with a disclaimer about the slightly odd vibe to the place and maybe a friendly suggestion that they wipe up a bit in my review.\n\nThis is where things took a turn for the worse. A medium sized party had entered the restaurant and placed their orders just as I was enjoying the last bites of sauce-dipped naan and they also appeared to have a couple of take-out customers. Our host asked me how everything was to our enthusiastic responses and disappeared into the kitchen.\n\nI got my credit card out and politely sat at the table waiting to deal with my bill. Twenty minutes later we were still waiting. Ten minutes later I asked a child if they could ask someone to help us with our bill. Twenty minutes passed and a surly woman came out, but it was to deal with a takeout customer. The child still clutched our bill and restaurant.com certificate.

Oh, there was only one other active table in the place, mind you. Over FORTY-FIVE minutes passed before we were finally served our entrees. This gave us plenty of time to look around the restaurant. Box tape was holding up decorations. A disco ball was the focal point of some streamers around the room. The TV was far too loud, but we probably should be grateful as it made it easy to keep our unflattering comments contained to our table. I refused to use the restroom there.\n\nFinally our meal arrived. The Chicken Karahi was nothing but a SMALL bowl of chicken breast swimming in Frank's Hot Sauce. Seriously. It was Frank's brand.

But more importantly we wanted our check so we could go get something to drink. No one was in sight. Not a cook. Not a server. Not a child. No one. So I called the restaurant from the table.

Eventually, a child came around and I asked for our check. Finally! Some acknowledgement -- or so I thought.

We were ignored.\n\nIt finally took the child TEN MORE MINUTES to deliver our check to the table. When we pointed out the groupon, she wanted to take the phone with her. We didn't allow that to happen (an iPhone is probably the most expensive thing that establishment has ever seen).

This restaurant is doomed and can not be saved. It's in a shady part of town, the service is HORRIBLE, the pricing is out of line with portion size and quality.\n\nMy message to the owners: Stop. Save what money and credit you have left and close your doors. Your chef can seem to only cook one dish at a time.

A waitress continued to apologize for the delay while we politely said no big deal. The actual appetizer, a shami kabob was OK. It was a bit too dry and singed on one side. The chutney was a bit runny and had obviously been watered down. I ordered a \"chai\" tea to see if they could make some authentic spicy tea to satisfy my craving. They couldn't. It was god awful-- watered down plain lipton tea with a bit of dairy creamer in it. It did not taste the least bit like authentic chai tea should and it was lukewarm at best. The main courses were passable. The tandoori chicken was juicy and spicy enough to be enjoyed by my girlfriend and i. Sizzling onions always compliment this dish well. The seekh kabob was nothing impressive-- you'll have better luck at Kabob korner at Fremont street. The biriyani wasn't bad but I've had much better. At least it was loaded with a decent amount of meat. The Naan was right on but it's pretty hard to screw that up. The entire dining experience was fraught with delays and took over 2 and a half hours. Thank god we happened to have a groupon which made our grand total about $5....service charge included.

I went to Mantra Masala recently for dinner with some friends.  This restaurant is small and hidden away, so we almost missed it.  The restaurant was smaller than I expected, and the lighting was quite dim, with ethnic music playing quietly in the background.  My friend had the Vegetable Samosa as an appetizer and the Lamb Vindaloo.  My other friend had the Lamb Mantra and the Taj Mahal beer.  My best friend and I shared the Chicken Biryani.  All four of us also had the Garlic Nan and Spinach Nan.  The Chicken Biryani was a bit mushy and not that remarkable.  My friend liked her Vegetable Samosa, but she didn't like her Lamb Vindaloo that much.  I tasted the Lamb Vindaloo, and I actually liked the potatoes in the dish, and the lamb was pretty tender.  The Lamb Mantra was pretty good, nice and spicy, and we also liked the Spinach Nan dipped in the yogurt they gave us. I gave Mantra Masala 3 stars because I felt that the dishes I tried here just wasn't as flavorful as the ones I tried at Tamba.

Unfortunately, I really didn't like my meal here.\n\nIt should also be noted that this is a review ONLY of the dinner buffet - it's possible that ala carte menu ordering will produce a different experience.\n\nAnyway, when my wife and I discovered a new Indian restaurant was opening in town we were pleased, but the news that this one would feature an Indian DINNER buffet had us over the moon. We are night owls by nature and during vacation times or on weekends we aren't always ready to go in time for a lunch buffet - the chance of a dinner option for Indian buffet sounded perfect.\n\nTonight we went in with no expectations. $9.99 or so per person for dinner seemed like a good deal, although we were surprised that Naan had to be purchased separately (it's usually included with the buffet - this is the first time i've seen it as an extra).\n\nThe selection was small and I ran into immediate problems. I'm not sure if this is synonymous with the particular cuisine Pyaar aims at - they claim to me \"The only North-South-Mogul Indian restaurant in Vegas\" - but I was surprised at the presence of a couple of beef dishes, the lack of any real \"main\" dish for vegetarians and nothing at all with the nice sauces I've come to expect from Indian food. \n\nNo Paneer dish, no Chicken Tikka Masala or Chicken Makhani, no samosas, no pakora, no kofta of any sort.  What I ended up with was the only two tandoori chicken drumsticks, some of the very wet \"chilli beef\" some of the vegetable curry and a lot of rice.\n\nThe tandoori chicken was fine if unspectacular and I'd have been OK to eat that and write it off as a \"notch in the belt\" but not somewhere I wanted to visit again, but unfortunately the rest of the tandoori was thighs which I don't like. The chilli beef tasted like a generic beef stew with a bit of chilli powder added, potatoes were OK-ish but a bit hard in the vegetable curry.\n\nMy vegetarian wife fared even worse than me - ending up with some chick peas and a bit of potato on top of a bed of basmati rice.\n\nBy the time our Naan (which tasted like a flour tortilla) arrived I realised that I had nothing to mop up as there was no dish featuring any of the delicious gravies I have come to associate with Indian food.\n\nAround 3 minutes into the meal my wife pretended to receive an urgent phone call and we apologised and asked for the check. The owners felt bad for us and were extremely nice, offering to let us fill up to go boxes from the buffet and they waived the cost of the Naan. \n\nNow, perhaps it's a different type of Indian cuisine and it's just our personal taste, but we really didn't like the buffet here at all. I feel bad having to pan this place so harshly because I really liked the owners, but I hope if they read this review they consider some changes to their buffet because right now it's uninspired bordering on inedible.", "review_stars": 1, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 4, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "We immediately got a great sense of family in this restaurant.

However my wife and I walked down from Bellagio on New Year's Day and the weather was perfect, both sunny and cool, and it was about 25 minutes walk in each direction.\n\nNote that this food is Nepali food, not Indian.  If you go expecting it to taste exactly like Indian, you'll be disappointed.

In particular, I like the food here better than what I get in most Indian restaurants in my area, even the popular ones.\n\nWe tried the Vegan Sampler platter for two ($28) and were not disappointed.  There was a mixed bean and lentil soup called kwati that had a delightful smoky flavor.  There were a few other curries including a garbanzo spinach combination and a potato cauliflower combination, each had its own different flavor and all the ingredients tasted FRESH.  Loved it.  All this came on a plate with whole wheat bread and rice.  We also had samosas as appetizers, and they were good though not spectacular like the rest.  We had hot tea (a tasty organic variety) rather than wine, but next time I'm going to try something from the intriguing wine list.\n\nWe left happy and well filled, though not heavy because the food was not rich.

Our server was also one of the \"lucky owners\", an extremely cordial and friendly man who recommended some delicious beers. It's obvious that he's a man who takes his libations seriously, which we appreciated. He explained that during the time of day we were there, he opted to maintain the restaurant himself. Aside from showcasing an impressive work ethic, it allows him to interact with his customers and gain insight on their reactions and feelings. He takes an active interest in the reviews and responses of individuals and mentioned that he periodically updates this page himself. :} So, Hi! Thanks for the meal! \n\nWe started with the Don de Dieu, a Canadian beer with a high alcohol percentage while still being light, floral, fruity and crisp. It was a nice beverage to sample while awaiting our food and taking in the environment. The interior is a pleasant cool green shade with dark wood tones on the tables, floor and chairs that we found very soothing and appealing. There are several pieces of art on the walls as well as iron work. The bar is well stocked and there is a window that lets you peak into the kitchen. Gently wafting in the background was atmosphere music, not too obtrusive but a pleasant addition.\n\nThe first food that was brought to us were flat breads that were studded with cumin/coriander seeds. They were folded over themselves and super thin, with a light crunch and pleasant mouthfeel. They were served with a mint and tamarind chutney. The tamarind was sweet and tangy but the mint was cool and savory. I vastly preferred the mint but we enjoyed both. We were given a refill of the bread and sauces prior to our meal. \n\nThe sampler itself was brought out on a large metal tray, with each dish presented in a small metal container. Initially it looked like it may not be that much food, but as we began to ate we realized that the 9 small containers were  easily enough to feed 3, maybe even 4 light eaters. With a refill of rice, we were extremely satisfied. The meal included; \n- Fresh baked garlic naan : hearty flat breads with fresh herbs and garlic studded throughout, served at the center of the platter and ideal for dunking into residual sauces/soup\n- Vegetable pakodas : crispy, deep fried bites of mixed vegetables. excellent dipped into the tangy and rich homemade whole-milk yogurt and a dollop of ghost chili sauce.\n- Chicken tikka masala : creamy with hearty chunks of chicken in a sauce that gradually ramps up the heat in your mouth. After a few bites it gains an addictive spice. \n- lamb vindaloo : like a stew, with a spice and sweetness differentiating it from the usual western stew. I particularly enjoyed this and would look forward to ordering it again. \n- organic tandoori chicken : tender, flavorful chicken with a yummy spice rub coating the outside, giving it a bright reddish-pink tinge. There were two peices and they were a little small, so this would be the only downside to ordering the platter for more than 2 people. They  may be willing to adjust the serving for a larger party if you ask, as they seem quite amicable. :}\n- mixed vegetable curry of the day : our's had lots of zucchini, chickpeas, tomatoes and a rich sauce. I probably wouldn't order this by itself, but that's simply because I dug the other vegetable based dish so much more. \n- chef's choice lentil soup : This was delicious! It had a strong turmeric flavor and color, and was very flavorful. The lentils weren't very chunky, so the soup itself was not exceedingly thick. I enjoyed the consistency, personally.\n- fresh, homemade whole-milk yogurt : One of my other favorite options. It was extremely creamy with a rich tang and was an instant relief from some of the strongly flavored dishes. A great way to cleanse your palate between dishes or dolloped on top of them. \n- aromatic basmati rice : A chewier, drier rice that easily soaked up much of the sauce from the dishes. A good compliment as the texture of the rice really helped to enrich and fortify the thinner or lighter dishes.\n- khir dessert : sweet rice pudding with what I thought may have been a hint of rosewater. I ate most of it and really enjoyed it!\n\nWhile eating we enjoyed two other beers, as well;\n\nYeti! An Indian beer that had a hoppy, smokey flavor. It was more of a dry lager, but went very very well with the food. We really enjoyed it and asked our server about sourcing it.\n\nWe ended with Piraat, a potent amber beer with an earthy tang and a hoppy afterbite. Also quite good, but strong! I gave most of mine to the boy to finish so I could safely navigate our journey home. \n\nI definitely intend to go back sometime for the lunch buffet and their other set menus.

I have been to Mint Bistro about 5 times, and have always had great food.  My favorite dish is the Saag Paneer, which is house-made Cheese sauteed with spinach.  They make a very good version of one of my favorite Indian dishes.  I also really like the Mango Masala with Chicken.  This dish combines the classic flavors of a Chicken Masala with the sweet Mango flavor.  The other dish I usually try to get is the Rebel Curry.  Very flavorful, but spicy, curry, served with your choice of meat.  If you are a vegetarian, Mint Bistro has many options for you, but if you eat meat you have many options, too.  \n\nMint Bistro also has a great selection of Belgian Beers.

Although it sounds random for a Indian restaurant to have a great selection of Belgian beers, they have some of the best I have seen.

We had a friend in from China, and since she likes to eat, we decided on a place where we can try something new, while socializing. We also know that Indian food meets many different dietary wants and needs, and this place has decent reviews and reasonable prices, so we came to Mint. \n\nWe arrived at 7pm to a very clean and modern dining room. The dining area was a little over half full. The clientele seemed very diverse with a mix of cultures and varying levels of dress. \n\nMint easily accommodated our party of 12, which was nice. We had a nice big table and were not cramped, nor did we cramp the other tables around us. The staff seemed friendly enough. However, we were waiting for 2 members of our party to arrive for about 30 minutes, but our waiters never asked for drink or app orders. That wasn't a huge issue, but once we ordered apps and drinks our waiter didn't ask us for our dinner orders for about another 30-45 minutes. We were all engaged in conversation, which I guess could have encouraged the waiter not to ask us. Overall, we were there for 3 hours, and the service was only so so.\n\nThe food was good. The wife and I shared the vegetarian sampler platter. Everything we had was distinctive, flavorful, and delicious. I don't know Indian/Nepalese food too well, so I can't say how authentic it was or was not, but it was pleasing to my palate. We asked for a level 7 spice, but I am pretty sure the waiter did not accommodate that as our food was not too spicy. We like heat, and only one of our dishes had a bit of heat. \n\nI was very impressed with 2 things: 1) The wide selection and friendliness towards vegans and vegetarians. We had more selections than we knew what to do with. I am really excited to go back to Mint just to try some more.\n2) Beer selection: There is a great selection of Indian and European beers here. They range in price from $5-$19 a bottle, but they have selections here I've not seen anywhere else in Vegas. Additionally, they do have a \"beer of the month\" which they sell cheaper than the others.

We are beer nerds so it makes for a lovely surprise that a unassuming Bistro would have such an impressive drink menu. The BF wasn't sure of what, and our server (I think possibly the owner) asked what kinds of flavors he likes and gave a few recommendations. I always appreciate a place that knows what they sell since it seems most people don't care about beer the way they do of wine. The BF took his suggestion of a Augustjn Abbey Ale ($7) and I had a Troubadour Obscura ($7) which the guy poured into TULIPS with care to produce a proper head! I had a nerd moment that they had the proper kind of glasses and someone cared about our drinks as much as we do. He treated it like a sommelier would a fine wine. \n\nWhile we waited for food we were served papadam with a tamarind chutney and a cilrantro mint chutney. All really finely made. \n\nFor food we really couldn't decide to we went with a Indian Sampler ($30). It doesn't look like a lot of food, but we were both comfortably full.\n\nIt includes:\n\n*chicken tikka masala- this was a lovely tikka. I've had a lot and this was one of the better ones I've had. Very robust, but balanced. The BF loved this and raves it's the best curry he's had and he had a foodie moment (aww, I think us Yelpers are getting to him...maybe he'll change his mind about doing reviews one day). \n\n*lamb vindaloo- the lamb was very tender and the sauce complimented it very well with a bit earthiness, tangyness and a tad spicy. \n\n*tandoori chicken- crisp and nicely spiced outside, juicy inside\n\n*mixed veggie curry- had a good mix of cauliflower, zucchini, beans, peppers. The curry had a very light and fragrant flavor to it...I can't quite place the spices, but I liked this. \n\n*chef choice of lentils- today it was daal. I like daal since it's earthy and comforting. \n\n*we got yoghurt, basmati rice, and garlic naan as well. The naan was pretty noms here. \n\n*Khir came with it for dessert. It's a rice and milk porridge with raisins, nuts and cardamom according to the menu. When I was eating it, to me it tasted more flowery than just cardamom, like possible orange blossom water was added. It's the kind of light dessert that would be amazing for a hot summer day since it's served cold and has such bright flavors.\n\nWe also ordered another dessert that I thought I had and loved at another restaurant and at friends house but haven't come across it in a while. Turns out it was what I was looking for! \n\nLal Mohan ($2.99) the description says it's served cold, but it's served piping hot! It's these round pastries that are fried so the outside is crisp and the inside has a creamy kind of dough. They throw it into syrup and it absorbs it so it flavors it throughout.They come 3 to a serving in a shot glass, balls are about gumball sized so you don't get much of it, but it's quality. It's a comforting kind of dessert that would be a good for people who like fried mochi with honey, warm donuts, zeppolis, beignets. \n\nThe service was friendly and helpful. I like the little details that show they care like having proper beer glasses or giving us warm plates. Utensils were impeccably polished- no water marks at all. It felt very comfortable with the warm decor and the good staff making you feel good about being there. I just got a strong feeling that they are proud of this place in the pride they take for the little details. \n\nI haven't been this surprisingly satisfied in a long time. The BF was super happy with discovering Indian food and having a food epiphany of sorts about it....days later he's still telling me about the tikka and how he wants to go next weekend. \n\n Definitely we will be coming back for a la carte and also the buffet sounds like a deal.

It's a rare occasion that small business owners give you positive reactions on a negative review so I was impressed enough to give Mint another chance. \n\nWow...the 2 of us were truly surprised (in a really good way) and absolutely enjoyed this buffet. There was a thin tomato soup that was tangy and a prolific salad/chutney assortment. Also their Dal Tadka was to die for. I filled multiple bowls of this delicacy. The pakoras (Indian vegetable tempura) were excellent. Special shout out to the thinly slivered potatoes coated with the garbanzo flour mixture. Yumminess. Soft and airy idlis with a thick and tasty sambar (the best in Vegas thus far) spoke to the South Indian in me. There was lemon rice that was full of flavor and their spicy chau chau noodles that were oh-so-perfect and what I am currently salivating about. There were 3 vegetable dishes (one paneer) and at least 5 meat based dishes on the buffet. Garlic Naans/Plain Naans/Rotis were brought to the table with the blink of an eye. \n\nNow for the grand finale. Dessert...my eyes popped when I saw they served Gulab Jamun (balls of dough and milk, deep fried and served in sugar syrup). The Gulab Jamuns were warm, melt in the mouth and probably the best I've had out here.

The rose flavor was really delicate ..it  didn't taste like I was consuming a rose garden. My husband had the Pomegranate Martini. He thought it was a little strong and so did I but I don't think that taste can be avoided when you are mixing juice with Vodka. I've had a Martini made with Baileys before ....I think that's more my speed. I don't think it was a true Martini but the taste is much smoother. \n\nI ordered the half order of Lamb Biryani $9.99.

It looked like a miniature piece of a tree branch but the tender lamb made up for it. \n\nMy husband ordered the Chicken Tikka Salad $5.99. The seasonal veggies that came with salad were super fresh. Good size cucumbers tomatoes, and chicken ...beautiful colors. It tasted good too! It's perfect for a late night snack that will not weigh you down. It tasted even better when you put some of the salad on the Naan and roll it up. My husband agreed that I know what I'm talking about it because he liked it . That's no easy feat. \n\nWe wanted to try some dessert so I ordered the Mango Kulfi. It's basically a milky mango ice cream. It's not sour like a sorbet... it was pretty tasty.

I also enjoyed the seasoned rice dish, as well as the Chicken Tandoori and a vegetarian dish called Paneer Tikka Masala (blocks of soft cheese simmered in a spicy tomato-based stew).

The foods was great but not for the money.\n\nThis is my first time I tried Rest voucher. I took a friend with me. It was definitely a lot less valuable as Groupon (from what I've gathered, there was Groupon offered at this restaurant recently). Groupon imposed no conditions on money spent (I assume you ordered $40 foods or more with your $20 purchase, then you paid the tax and tips on top, for a minimal of $23.24). Rest voucher dictated you ordered twice as much and paid 18% tip, plus tax. For $25 voucher (you may pay $15 for it), you have to order $45 min of food. So the final total was about $49. What's my saving? If I've got the voucher for free, I still paid about $33. How much is my saving then? If I order the foods without the voucher, I would have paid about $49 too. What's wrong with this picture.\n\nWith this irritation aside, the foods were good. Not excellent, but tasty. I was surprised with a one-page Nepalese section. I have never tried Nepalese foods before. And I don't consume east Indian foods often. So we ordered Nepalese sampler $29.99 and a Tandouri chicken $14.99. There was also a Indian sampler for $30.99 available.\n\nThe portion on the sampler was so small (2 oz per metal cup) that I could easily finish by myself and still feel hungry. It came with 4 pieces of turkey dumpling, 2 oz red curry chicken (4 cubes), 2 oz vegetarian, 4 small pieces of skewed lamb (in 2 oz cup), 2 oz broth, 2 oz cucumber salad, 2 servings of 2 oz steamed rice, 3 small pieces of brown desserts, and one cut up Naan. Luckily we had Tandouri chicken to contribute a small space in our stomach; it came with 5 small pieces of thighs and drumstick with plenty of onions. I have to be honest, I don't have a fine palate for Indian cuisine. The Nepalese foods tasted like Indian foods.\n\nEven though it tasted good, but I had similar or better at various cities. A meat sampler costs $12.99 and Tandouri chicken $8.99 during a visit to Flagstaff (I thought it was a bit pricey at the time comparing to the restaurant in SoCal excluding San Diego).\n\nThe service was plain ordinary. I can hardly understand our server's thick accent. I wound never have paid 18% tips on this kind of service.\n\nThe location was off the strip but in the midst of Asian commercial district. There were many Indian and some Filipino restaurants in the neighborhood.\n\nSo diners, beware what you are getting from Restaurant.com voucher. It feels like a scam to benefit the restaurants.

It's not like most Indian places I'm used to. A little more upscale, a little more gourmet, a little more... well... different. My paradigm for Indian food is, in general, that the best food comes from the dingiest places - so a proportionally inverse relationship between the fanciness of the decor and the quality of the food (from the standpoint of taste). When I walked in to Mint I immediately formed an impression about what I was going to eat, and I was not too surprised in the end. Just glad to have some decent Indian food since I come from a place that has none. \n\nThe food at Mint falls into the higher-end category - better meats, obviously more hand-made sauces, etc. Not as dirty, earthy, pungent, and 'street' as the style that really rocks my socks. But it's good nonetheless, and sticks fairly well to form as being actual Indian and not fusion, which is what I tend to see at higher-end Indian places. \n\nI sampled the chicken Vindaloo, which at a half order contained a surprising amount of tender, succulent chicken but not the same amount of potatoes that I'm used to. It has a decent heat to it but not quite the \"fiery descent\" that's comically described on the menu. The Saag Paneer is quite nice, with a less 'spinach-y' flavor than I'm used to. A much more subtle and balanced version of the heady green beast. The name of our third curry escapes me - a blond affair with veggies. Nice and creamy and delicious - probably my favorite of the three. Paired up with a bowl of basmati rice and a basket of Roti, 3 half-sized (8oz) dishes makes for a beyond-filling meal for two. Props for offering half-size portions... if only the price were half too!\n\nThe drinks list is mighty impressive, with a very extensive beer selection, some fun cocktails including a whole spate of flavored lassi offerings, and of course wine. My rose vodka lassi was interesting (tasted like rose!) and the mango rum is exactly what you'd expect. \n\nThree half-plates, Roti and two lassi cocktails came to a sum total of $54, kind of a lot for the amount of food, but definitely a higher quality of ingredients than I'm used to seeing in the street Indian I usually seek out. The experience, including the impeccable service, also adds in to the value. Papadam to start, clean plates to transition from papadam to meal, and constantly full waters.

However, we found a great deal at Mint to be happy about.\n\n1) Lassi bar.  Both my husband's mint lassi (not sweet) and my blackcurrant lassi (sweet) were sublime.  The color, the flavor, and the texture were all just perfect.  We did not have liquor in either lassi.\n\n2) Drinks list is extensive, with many beers I remember fondly from my visits, including a wonderful lambic, a beer named \"Troubadour Obscura,\" and a bock that is probably one of the best beers I've ever tasted.\n\n3) Diverse menu-- mostly Indian with some Chinese, Tibetan, and Nepalese-influenced dishes-- with many can't-fail choices.\n\nI've enjoyed the \"Rebel Curry\" on a previous visit, but this time we had the momos-- delicate meat-filled dumplings similar to a potsticker, served with a spicy tomato-based sauce.  I had the tamarind rice, a vegetarian offering that worked well as an entree after the course of momos.  My husband had the chicken Chau Chau-- one of the Tibetan noodle dishes-- and a bowl of the delicious noodle soup.  I had the warm sweet carrot Halwa for dessert and my husband had kulfi; our two fellow guests, both newcomers to Tibetan and Nepalese food, both enjoyed the Chau Chau with shrimp and the lamb momos.  \n\nService was spotty-- the server had to be asked three times to provide lemon wedges for our water, and frequently missed at least one person at our four-person table when providing refills or removing dishes.  And during almost every course-- beer, entree, dessert-- we encountered the news that something we'd ordered wasn't available at that moment (no Ras Malai or Hakka noodles), so each of were eating and drinking our \"second best\" picks for at least one course out of the menu.  The dessert I ordered wasn't available and the server took it upon himself to bring me out mango kulfi instead, which was a nice gesture but a terrible idea, as I am allergic to mangoes and had previously indicated I did not want mangoes in my iassi.  Dishes are presented attractively on four-cornered white plates but presentation isn't really exceptional.\n\nIn spite of these hiccups, we had a very good time, which goes to show how excellent the food and drink here are.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll be heading to Flamingo Rd for another lassi and a plate of momos.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Cool half moon booths.

They also have just as many vegetarian options as they do options for carnivores, which is a plus.  It also helps that these vegetarian options are tasty.\n\nAvoid any of their sauced dishes described as \"bone-in\" or \"with bone\".  Bone shards can be found throughout these dishes, and while tasty, a bone can be a real turn off texture wise if you don't break a tooth on it.  That said, this is a minor downside.\n\nNotes:  Baskets of naan like baskets of chips at a Mexican restaurant?  Oh hell yes.  Also, paneer varies from restaurant to restaurant.

This is really nice when eating spicy Indian food (of which there was none here.)  The restaurant is very clean and attractive, the service is very friendly.  They bring naan fresh to your table and the naan was good.\n\nThe bad - Most of the buffet was bland, bland, bland.  And I don't mean just 'not spicy' bland, but 'no flavor' bland.  The tikka masala was gloppy, like the cream in it had curdled, but it had little flavor.  I was SOOO excited to see goat curry (my favorite dish ever!) on the buffet... but it was bland, bland, bland.  The meat was good but the curry...nonexistant.  The saag was downright horrible - the worst I've ever had.  Everything tasted like they'd forgotten salt (and I don't like overly salted food).  The creamy tofu curry had no flavor.  The kheer was also pretty dreadful.  They use rice angel hair instead of rice, so it had a slimy wormy consistency and the runny 'sauce' did not taste good.  I usually love kheer but I took one bite and that's it.\n\nThe indifferent - the gulab jamun was about average though I couldn't taste any cardamom in the simple syrup, which is a letdown.  The dal was subtly flavored but not too bad.  The best dishes on the buffet were the 'chili chicken' (tasted like mexican-indian fusion but actually had some flavor) and the 'veggie chow chow' which is some sort of noodle dish that didn't really remind me of any Indian food, but didn't taste bad.\n\nThe buffet was about $11 per person.  There were a surprising number of indo-pak folks in here, surprising because of how bad the food was.  Normally at the places I frequent in other cities that have a lot of indo-pak clientele, the food is very spicy and flavorful (sometimes too spicy for my pansy white arse even).  But here, it was like the baby-food bland version of everything.  Why were they here?  Is this really the best Indian food available in Vegas?  I shudder to think that is the case.  I hope they were just having a bad day but honestly the food wasn't good enough for me to want to find out, despite the nice touches of fresh naan and abundant water.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "Feel: you enter this place and want to feel good about this place, good lighting comfortable seatings et all.

Naturally I skipped over the fruits and veggies on the first cart and went right to the rice, pakoras, and varieties of dals, curries, and chicken dishes.  First thing I noticed that I appreciated wholly was that each item had notations on whether they were vegan, vegetarian, had glucose, or had jain.  One of the friendly servers heard my friend and I seemingly confused over what that even was and she explained it (people who dont/cant eat garlic or onions?  Perish the thought!)

We all enjoyed the pakora (they called them pakodas) and again thought we were in for the best Indian meal in a long time. That being said, the lamb vindaloo was rather skimpy on the lamb (and it was tougher than it should have been), the chicken tikka masala had great flavor; but was more masala than chicken, and the daal was good, but just a tad undercooked. I was also disappointed when I asked for a \"6-7 spicy\" I received something more like a 2 or 3. They do have something they call Inferno chili sauce, but I thought my dishes came from a very universal pot that's geared to less spice (and flavor). As other reviewers have noted, their naan bread is excellent. Service was satisfactory, but I never felt like I was being \"served\" meaning it was more obligatory than driven. \n\nAll in all, a good Indian meal, though I have had better for less money.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "This was my first Indian restaurant in Vegas.

My OCDness likes that they organize their buffet trays from starters to sides to entrees.

I'm pretty sure I've tried everything there, but these are my go to dishes.\n\nThe 5 stars comes from food and price alone.  They really do have delicious high quality food.  The service is consistently mediocre if not subpar, but if I'm at Mint it's for the food.  Also, it takes awhile for drinks to come out, especially if you order coffee.

Called in my order for takeout and headed on over. Upon entering, saw that the restaurant itself was a bit nicer and more upscale than I expected. Service was a bit lackluster- waited for a bit at the door before being acknowledged, my boxed food was waiting at a table with a manager-looking guy who brought over my receipt and took my card with a series of gestures, then ran my card and disappeared without a thank you or asking if I needed anything else. \nThat probably explains why I didn't get any utensils or napkins, nor did I add on another side or additional naan as I'd originally planned. And there were only two tables seated at 5:30PM so it's not because they were busy.\n\nI found this place to be a bit pricey. \nI like that half-size entrees are available for a slightly-lesser fee, but found that the decrease in pricing (usually around $3) isn't worth the decrease in product. Lesson learned. For three half-size entrees, one container of rice was provided. Also ordered one garlic naan. Total was around $40, which is a bit steep. I always have difficulty paying so high for a la carte indian food when the buffet prices are so cheap for so much. I feel like there's a discrepancy there that should result in lower prices rather than higher, but whatever.\n\nQuality made my entree choices worthwhile: saag paneer, baingan bharta, and lamb korma. The saag was decent but I prefer mine a little saucier, this one was a lot of spinach and good-sized cubes of paneer but the dish seemed as if it hadnt been cooked down long enough. Best eaten with the garlic naan, which was fragrant and delicious.\nBaingan bharta was ordered exclusively based on recommendations here on Yelp, and I was not disappointed. It was flavorful and I appreciated that the sauce was on the thicker side, which allowed for it to go well with the rice. \nThe lamb korma is the only dish that had any spice to it whatsoever, and it was quite mild despite ordering a 5/10- at Thai restaurants, that'll get you a spicy dish, but I guess Indian is a little more laid back with the scale. I know now for next time. Dish didn't have quite as much lamb as expected for a $10 portion.\n\nSpeaking of portions, I was a little confused by the portions and packing of my takeout.\nI appreciated that the half-size entree portions were packed in plastic lidded containers and wrapped in plastic to ensure that nothing spilled. But the size of the portions themselves were on the small side- think the smallest hummus containers at the grocery. That size. \n\nGoing to put this on the list to try again for the lunch buffet, thinking that will be a better value and possibly a better overall experience.

All dishes on this page are made with ghost peppers.  You have to sign a waiver before eating from this menu our server RS told us.  There's one challenge that if you finish, you get your photo on their Wall of Fame and you get a $50 Mint gift card for future use.  I don't think it's accepted by any hospitals.

The menu change also allows you to order vindaloo and choose the protein you want--cheese, lamb, veggies, goat (bone in), swordfish, shrimp--and you choose your spiciness from 1 to 10.  I chose \n7 and I could have had more spice.  8 or 9 next time.  My wife ordered the Maharaja Tikka Masala with chicken breast (again choice of protein similar to the vindaloo).  She chose a spiciness of 3.  We also got an order of buttered garlic naan.\n\nEverything was excellent!  The vindaloo had good spicy flavor and the sauce was very flavorful.  There were cut potatoes in the sauce, too.  My wife enjoyed her dinner and she also expressed that it could be spicier.  Wow, are we going to 4 or 5 next time?  What happened to my gabacha?  The naan was the tastiest we've had here.  It wasn't quartered like other times but served in one large round that we tore apart.\n\nAfter dinner, she got khir and I pistachio kulfi.

It's an appetizer dish with chicken that appears to have been marinated and then cooked in a batter or something.  IDK - I'm not a foodie and I don't know all the intricacies of HOW a dish is prepared.. all I know is that it was DAMN good!  I had meant to get a dish to go on my way back home the next day but forgot.  The other dishes were almost as good - WAY better than standard, but not quite as exceptional as the appetizer.  For spiciness, we got 8 which was just PERFECT for us.  We like it pretty spicy though, so for people less tolerant, you might want to dial it down a bit.\n\nService - which I think is the second most important in any dining experience, was PHENOMENAL - I would say it was pretty close to an all-time best for me.  We had sat down and since my gf is the foodie I let her pick the dish while I proceeded to check something on my phone.  As soon as I whip out my phone, the manager comes and asks if I need access to the wifi, which I gratefully accept.  The rest of the evening is just as attentive, friendly, and considerate.  I don't have time to go into all the details, but ALL of the staff were extremely pleasant, and attentive.  They are also very international which I really liked a lot.  There were Indian staff of course, but also Caucasian, Eastern Asian, and other ethnicity as well.  India, which has historically been a major fulcrum of the Silk Road is well represented by the people working here.  It was an absolutely delightful dining experience, adding another dimension to the tasteful decor and immaculate ambiance.  It almost makes me not want to leave a good review in fear that it will be over-crowded the next time we visit.  ;)  but the people working there REALLY deserve every bit of the praise.  I wish I had more time and the descriptive capacity to do them justice, but you'll simply have to experience it for yourself.  :)\n\nPS:  I rarely ever do yelp reviews btw, but this one I really WANTED to do.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "This is hands down the best Indian Restaurant in town.

With $11, I was given a selection of 45 items. 45 dishes (15 is usually standard in any indian buffet)  in an Indian Buffet is unheard of. And it gets better. What makes India Masala stand out from its competitors  is that besides having nearly triple the quantity of dishes to choose from for less than $11, you're always in for a surprise. Unlike other traditional indian buffets, the items on the buffet at India Masala change everyday. Some traditional items such as Chicken Tikka Masala, Tandoori Chicken, Dal Makkhani etc. remain, but for the most part, dishes change each day. Also, it features both North & South Indian dishes in their buffet. In the end, best Indian buffet in Vegas. \n\nDinner: When i step into any restaurant, there are 3 things I stick my neck out for: Food, Ambience, & Service. The food is phenomenal. My friends and I ordered a Family Dosa. Its a BIG BIG CREPE about 4 feet long! Also, I had the Chicken 65 as an appetizer, Lamb Madras Curry, and Garlic Nan. Chicken 65 was highly recommend by our server. It didn't disappoint. It was a dry red chicken. The flavor was quite different and thus hard to explain. All I remember is that each bite felt electric, literally. Lamb Madras Curry was also great. I ordered a spice level 7 and it was PERFECT. The curry had a great depth of flavor.

Everything was underseasoned, not enough salt or hot spice...there really was none. \n\nThe buffet had the appearance of being bountiful because of the meat and vegetables were in the front buffet. It definitely captivate the eyes and stomach of customer.  However once at the buffet I found it not logically flowing once at the buffet.  It does not flow logically, which would be flowing from appetizers and papadums, to rice, noodles, and breads then veggies and meats.  Here the buffet started  with plates, tandoori chicken, chicken tikka, fish curry, daals, vegetable curries...all very soupy items that probably should have rice or a starch served first so the sop up the gravies.   In addition, too much repetition. 5 Proteins- 1 fish curry and 4 types of chicken (tandoori, wings, tikka, and curry),  4 daals, and 2 batter fried vegetable and 2 cheap starchy filed vegetable dishes...a gobi filled with chana and a \"vegetable\" curry dominated by potatoes and peas. Not reflective of the delicious quality vegetables dishes Indian cuisine has been admired for.  No paneer, as a vegetarian source of complete protein instead of ANOTHER chicken dish?\n\nFurthermore, a very disjointed buffet offering, sambar without idli or dosa? mint chutney and tamarind chutney without samosa or chaat?  Come on!  You give the facade of bounty, but it is incomplete.  You know better, but undermine true Indian Buffet fans in order to cut costs. There are a ton of Indian buffets that are better for the same price and most are around you.\n\nWhile this commonly happens at most buffets, it seem to be with every gravy dish... all the \"good\" stuff was gone and it seemed once it was finished, it was finished. Yet coming at 1 PM and the buffet is from 11:30 to 3:00 pm...I do expect it to be replenished, but didn't see it happen in the 45 minutes I was there.  \n\nUnderstandably the dishes were mild, but there should be some \"hot\" sauce/condiment offered...I didn't see any, but I also never asked for any.  \n\nOut of all the dishes the tandoori chicken was the best, it remained juicy yet it was still underseasoned and DEFINITELY NOT cooked in a tandoori.\n\nOne of the more promising things about the restaurant was that the atmosphere was \"nice\" and up to date and most importantly the service was way above par of most Indian restaurants...as an Indian it is rare to get treated as well as \"non-Indian\" customers.

In general, what I look for in Indian buffets is value, variety, and flavor.  Thus far, I think Taj Palace wins in flavor, Mint has variety but seems to always underwhelm me in the flavor category, and Saffron is severely lacking in variety (no Tandoori chicken...I literally observed an angry customer lecture the waiter on the lack of tandoori chicken and then proceeded to order some on top of his buffet).  Not quite ready to proclaim India Masala as best one in town since I still need to cross off Mt. Everest and Namaste off the list, but for *value (see below) and variety, they deserve some props.  \n\nIn general, I have been surprised by the high prices for Indian buffets in Vegas compared to some other places I've lived (almost always in the double digit dollar range) and I'm at a point in my life where I no longer have the capability to polish off 3-4 plates + dessert to get my money's worth so just like an aging Greg Maddux who has to add some off-speed pitches to compensate for his slower fastball or Michael Jordan adding a fadeaway to his shot selection during the second half of his career, I too had to change up my game, and this buffet is ideally suited for my plan of attack.  \n\nBack in college, when my roommate and I were short on cash, we would routinely compete to see who could pack the most food in the local Indian restaurant \"take out buffet\" styrofoam tray.  Over several trips, we came up with the ideal arrangement which consisted of wet items on the bottom, layer of rice to soak up some flavors but with dry side above, as much tandoori chicken as we could fit, then cushioning everything with naan and other odds and ends.  This ended up easily being the equivalent of 3-4 meals while preserving the integrity of of each item.   So when I showed up one day from my office with a short lunch break, I went with the buffet-to-go option and was ecstatic when they presented me  not only with the usual styrofoam tray, but packed my naan separately in tinfoil and gave me two additional styrofoam bowls....huzzah!  My college roommate would be nodding in approval as I packed my tray full bursting at the seams but now had two additional bowls which I could pack with soup, dessert, salad, or additional rice/or any liquid item suitable for dipping my crispy warm naan.  All in all I foraged enough food to feed a small Indian village.\n\nIn terms of variety, this is a double edged sword since like other reviewers have mentioned, this can be hit or miss both in terms of quality (some dishes soared whereas others fell flat) and the expectation of seeing your favorite dishes being present on any given day is highly variable since they do a good job (perhaps too good) of rotating dishes in and out.  I've been here 3 times, and I've seen at least 2-3 distinct dishes not present from before including sauteed okra, fish curry, egg curry, goat curry, and the occasional indo-chinese food item (definitely get this when it is available).  The setup of the restaurant inside is very clean, spacious, and welcoming and for someone that appreciates variety, I like the fact that they take chances and have something for everyone, but not everything is for everyone.  It's an educational foodie experience to see the a wide spectrum of rice dishes, unique desserts, and breads that you won't know if you will like unless it's put forth in front of you.  One glaring omission from the buffet is the samosas since I have yet to see an appearance and while taste of specific items may not be superior to other buffets across town, it definitely edges out Mint head-to-head for the lunch buffet on the east side since they are not afraid to throw in some spice and I'd much rather the items err on being bold than being bland.  3.5 stars with an extra half star bump due to the hidden value in getting their buffet to go.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 7, "useful": 9, "cool": 5}}, {"text": "This review is for the BUFFET ONLY. Since I was so pleased with my food when I visited last time, I thought about trying the buffet. They had 3 types of chicken; tikka masala, tandoori and something called chicken veduppu(spelling?). I had a small piece of the veddupu chicken and it was really good and seemed to have good flavor. The tikka masala was ok.\n\nI was hoping for atleast a couple of options of the indo chinese dishes, but all they had was a schezwan veggie dish, which was super super spicy and I could just have a few bites. They also had dosas which though fresh were not crisp, and were wrongly labeled as utthapam. About the labels-I would suggest that they take care to label food properly, as they had labeled the potato mix that goes with dosas as aloo gobhi(cauliflower potato). The mix itself was ok and had very large pieces of potato and was obviously not the original stuff served with dosas. So the 2 things I was looking forward to-south indian and indo chinese were seriously lacking in taste.\nFor veggies, they had a few options-okra, black dal, some veg curry. I tried a bit of the okra and dal and they were just ok.\n\nDesert was pretty blah too: pink colored fruit custard and halwa. They need to really consider labeling and arranging the food in a logical order, as I remember standing in the middle of the buffet looking for rice, as it was placed next to the desert. The halwa was labeled 'kesari' which I think is a south indian version of halwa so I knew it was desert. However, for my non hindi speaking friends, it might have been confusing as it was placed next to the rice and could have passed off as a savory dish.\n\nI guess these are initial glitches and I do hope they improve, as I would love to have one indian restaurant in Vegas that serves consistently good food.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Not overly impressed.

This was the first time I've ever encountered an Indian restaurant that had dishes for those who observe Jain as a religion, and as a cuisine. Or at least identified as Jain on a menu. Quickly and secretly reading Wiki, I find that their cuisine consists of a refusal to eat \"bulbs\", meaning no garlic, onions, potatoes or such. Fascinating read, Jainism.\n\nBut back to the meal. We had a LOT of food, cuz we had a GROUPON, but also cuz we love so much about Indian cuisine, and simply don't go enough.\n\n- Cuminium: A cocktail containing gin, absinthe, cumin and other things! It was actually quite interesting, and enjoyable.\n- Vegetable samosas: Not the best we've had, but quite good.\n- AndhraSpicy Masala Dosa: Under the \"southern Indian\" column in the menu, this was quite good. Kinda like having the samosa again, except in a crepe, dusted with a spicy powder that, like szechuan pepper, built up spice in the mouth. Great dipping sauces, including one akin to a minestrone soup? Highly recommended, and in fact, I think the \"southern\"  column, or vegetarian selections, is the way to go here. (Keep reading.)\n- Flying Horse lager: Split a tall Indian beer, this one we had never before encountered, it was light but worked with the main courses.\n- Shrimp Chettinadu: Billed as a 21-spice concoction (again, something we'd never before encountered), unfortunately the shrimp were overcooked. But the sauce, very dry for a sauce, was interesting enough.\n- Lamb Pepper Fry: Again the protein, this time lamb, was overcooked. Tough. But the onions, grilled and raw (NOT A JAIN ITEM!) and other things made it overall tasty.\n\nSo overall we thought India Masala was about mid-way in this town for its quality of Indian cuisine. We've had worse, we've had better. I want to eventually return for the lunch buffet . (I have found that some places which aren't quite successful at dinner do quite well with their buffet.)

Speaking of that, 7 is not high enough for a good spice level.  Their 7 was rather tame and the curry seemed to be lacking some of the rich flavor it should have.  Perhaps I'm spoiled by Thai curry.  I think I need to stay away from indian curry.  The kheer had no pistachio chunks on it which somewhat makes the dish interesting.  I saw the photo that Westie W. posted and I thought that it was really enticing.  The no regular iced tea threw me.

The taste was awful.  But the Tandoori chicken was the worst.  The chicken arrived with 'stuff' piled on top of it - tomatoes, onions, some kind of 'sauce' I guess - so the chicken was all goopy and wet, not the texture you expect for something supposedly taken straight out of a super-hot oven.  My guess is, they didn't want to fire up the tandoori oven, so just microwaved a bunch of chicken pieces and dumped some stuff on top.  \n\nI drove all the way from Scottsdale at 9pm on a Friday night for this ... :(\n\nI was born / raised in England, and now reside primarily in the Bay Area (home to many Indians!) so I feel like I know what a good Indian meal should taste like!", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I was in town visiting my family and we stopped here to try it.

I was the first to arrive by at least ten minutes.  This gave me ample time to survey the buffet and ask the host questions concerning my food allergies.  However, before I started with the allergy questions, I inquired if the buffet came with dosa.  The host said yes.  (We would later find out, during check out, that \"buffet dosa\" cost an additional $4.  So, the correct answer would be no.)  After all of my questions had been answered, I concluded that only the white basmati rice, bread (plain paratha and iddly), four of six chutneys, homemade papadum, and dessert [homemade cottage cheese balls (think non-fried gulab jamun) soaked in sweetened coconut milk sprinkled with crushed pistachios and other spices] were allergen-free.  I'm not much of a \"chips and dips\" person (unless spinach, artichoke, garlic, and cheese and a few whole wheat crostini are involved), so my prospects concerning the buffet looked pretty grim.  While attempting to place a phone call and I wondering out loud if I should have my friend meet me elsewhere, I spied a dish containing one dosa sitting on my table.  The host overheard my asking my friend if he was going to have the buffet (yes, that was his intention), and I then asked the host that rather I have my friend meet me elsewhere, which meant that the dosa would have to be thrown away, could he have the buffet and dosa, and I could order something off the menu?  Yes was the answer.  Before I even looked at the menu, I ordered the palak paneer with rice.  He quickly turned in my order, and I proceeded to take a couple of bites of the now-cooled dosa.  The host suddenly did a 180 and returned to my table to tell me that I couldn't share my friend's buffet or else he would have to charge me for another buffet.  I said that I was only having the cold dosa, which he would have to throw away had I decided to leave, and he said that it was against restaurant policy for two people to share the buffet.  I said I understood, that I wasn't intending to share my friend's buffet entree, but that I was only having the cold dosa which my friend would probably prefer to be hot and fresh.  (I made a mental note not to come back here anymore, or at least, not to come back anytime soon.

It took about 20 minutes for my palak paneer (spinach, homemade cottage cheese cubes, onions, spices, and coconut curry) entree to arrive, but the wait was definitely worth it- the spinach leaves had a beautiful dark green color to it and weren't at all mushy, the cubes of cheese were meaty on the outside and creamy on the inside, and the onions, cubed chilies, and spinach stems and other spices perfected the masterpiece.  I can eat this over rice or stuff it into dosa or pita bread and be blissful!\n\nIt's good to know that the food served here is delectable.

I asked my servers if the dosa and the chutneys were free of certain allergenic ingredients and was told, with authority I might add, that the dosa was OK and while two of three chutneys [coconut and jalapeno-cilantro (?)] were off-limits, the sambar is good-to-go.  (He even pointed out an allergen ingredient in the coconut chutney.)  The A-OK signal on the sambar surprised me greatly, as out of the three choices, it was the first item I'd have balked at trying (I've tried it at many other restaurants and was told that the recipe calls for a few allergens).  My server did offer to bring tamarind sauce to replace the other two chutneys.  Since I was almost salivating at the sight of the dosa and the server was pretty confident in his knowledge of chutney ingredients, I dove my spoon into the sambar and came up with a lovely and flavorful chunk of potato and a bit of broth.  Yum!  I went in again, this time swirling a bit to make sure there weren't any allergens hiding in the murky depths when I spotted *!  As if on cue, my server AND the host approach my table to tell me that I should not eat the sambar nor the dosa since they contained allergens.  Argh!  So, away went my Udupi special spring dosa, away went the sambar, and I was back to square one as to what to order, although this time I knew I had a few hours of pain and nausea to look forward to (which started to rear their ugly heads as I was signing my credit card receipt).\n\nAt this point, the host was steering me away from the dosa menu since I'd have to stay away from all that contained any filling (apparently, the kitchen staff could not whip up a filling that omitted the one ingredient that kept me from having it).  Under normal circumstances, this wouldn't be such a terrible thing as there are many other dosa options that would then be complemented with chutneys, but since the three chutneys also contained an ingredient I couldn't have (again, the chef would not be able to make the sauces omitting the ingredient- the host explained that the chutneys were made in huge batches earlier in the day), dosa from Udupi Cafe is off-limits for me :(  I decided, then, to have the assorted appetizer platter.  This would've only been accompanied by tamarind sauce had I not asked for a second option, plain yogurt, as suggested by the host.  \"Plain yogurt?,\" I asked.  \"Could you add something else to flavor the yogurt?\"  \"Carrots.  Is carrots OK?,\" the host posited.  \"Yes, carrots are alright,\" I said.  \n\nThe three items I savored in the app platter were cauliflower pakora, the samosa, and the veggie cutlet^.  I wasn't a fan of the dense mysore bonda (various fillings of potato, eggplant, and jalapeno) nor the bready medhu vada (fried lentil donuts), although the latter was quite good dipped in tamarind sauce AND yogurt.  In retrospect, I did not particularly revel in the recurring reminders of how everything was deep-fried :(\n\nIn light of the disinclination of Udupi Cafe to omit certain ingredients in their dishes- which leads me to believe that most items are already pre-made and later plated (if you read my other reviews, you'll see just how many chefs are quite willing to swap out/sub sauces, sometimes PIQUED at the chance to come up with a new sauce on-the-fly) and the the reluctance in creating a simple chutney, I doubt I'll keep UC at the top of my choices next time I have a taste for Indian cuisine.

I enjoyed each dessert, especially the ras malai, which is a sweetened creamy paneer.  It was my first time trying it, and it was delicious.  They also had a thermos with cardamom-infused chai tea, with a sign saying it could be made vegan if requested.  \n\nThe price is expensive considering that this is only a vegetarian/vegan buffet (About 11 to 12 dollars per person for the weekend buffet, sodas and iced tea extra), but there is a lot of variety to try to make up for it.

[Indian Paradise on N Hayden in Scottsdale is the other].  \nSo many items to choose from on the menu and all spiced more authentically than more mild/bland (relatively) buffet offerings. \nDefinitely get one of their Dosa/Dosai (we shared one among 3 of us) and if you are a vampire don't order the Garlic Paratha, garlic lovers and those looking to boost their immunity will appreciate the generous amount of garlic.  \nDon't let the fact that it is vegetarian scare you, believe me you won't be missing the meat with all the great flavors and textures.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Best Indian I've had in the valley.

He guided us straight and true and suggested I order the Chicken Korma Curry in mild.\n\nMild did NOT mean watered down and Americanizes. It meant not fire in your face, but enough of a kick to keep life interesting.\n\nOh. My . God.\n\nSeriously.\n\nOh. My.

That's a good sign.\n\nAs with the previous place, the buffet still is very small.  There were perhaps 6 vegetarian items, and 6 \"regular\" items.  Except that included the desserts.  They didn't even ask if I wanted a menu, they just said to go to the buffet.  I get the feeling they don't like people ordering off the menu.\n\nThe food itself was good.  The goat curry you wouldn't know it was goat if it wasn't labeled.  It could easily have been beef (but wasn't, for religious reasons, I suspect).  The tikka was good also, and they had a rice dish  that was very tasty.  I think it was labeled as a mushroom rice, although I didn't notice any mushrooms.  But it was very nice.  They also had biryani, and it was good too.  All in all, the food was good.\n\nThey are a bit pricey.  Just under $10 for the buffet (weekday lunch).  And if I wanted a Coke it would have been extra (though they did have the real-sugar Coke).  When we were done paying the check was very inefficient.  They don't bring it to the table, you go to the register and tell them how many buffets, and then (eventually) get your credit card and run it.  I'm not sure what was going on, but the group in front of me had a conversation with the register person (owner??) that I couldn't understand, and it took a long time before he finally asked me how many buffets I needed to pay for.\n\nAs I said, the food is pretty good.

As a vegetarian, I'm really glad there are so many vegetarian restaurants in Edinburgh, especially a few more affordable ones. \n\nI've noticed some strange comments for some of the veggie restaurant reviews around Edinburgh. Some comment about the fact that despite the fact they eat meat they enjoyed a meat free meal, as if they are surprised that the addition of meat doesn't magically make something taste nice. The other common point made is that they DIDN'T enjoy a vegetarian restaurant because it had no meat in it. It's sad that a restaurant can't be evaluated in its own terms, we don't review an Italian saying \"well I usually eat only Thai food so this Italian was a bit crap\". I assume that even reviewers who claim they can't live without eating meat don't judge their morning toast by its absence of beef.\n\nSo let me say that Ann Purna is a restaurant that serves great food irrespective of its absence of meat. If anything this proves just how flavourful, nutritious and filling vegetarian food can be. Apparently they do serve some meat dishes when requested, but this seems pointless.\n\nSo yeah, I thought the food here tasted great. My girlfriend and I ordered a sweet, coconut flavoured, creamy dish which brilliantly complemented another savoury, tomato based aubergine curry. Along with the saffron rice (which remember you have to order separately as its not included in the price of the curry), this meal was satisfying. It was a little higher than average price wise, when you take into account the curry, the rice, and probable bread, poppadoms or side dishes.

The staff were very welcoming but we had a bit of strange experience while ordering. The waiter seemed overly keen to get us to order a starter we just didn't want. He then insisted we ordered a side dish. We already wanted poppadoms, and when they arrived, it came with a range of chutneys to try. \"Great\" we thought \"complimentary dips\". Only when we looked at our bill we discovered it wasn't complementary at all. They had seemingly brought us something and charged us without a word! To makes things stranger, they also deducted two of our poppadoms which actually WERE complimentary- only they cost much less than the \u00a33 they charged us for the chutney without telling! I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say they messed up, otherwise this was pretty unacceptable. You don't want a homely \"student friendly\" restaurant to rip you off. I look forward to revisiting and finding out!\n\nThis experience however couldn't detract from the excellent food. It was so good it's inspired me to be more adventurous with my own curry in future!

The general tendency in an Indian buffet is to keep it bland.  The buffet has to make a lot of different palates happy and the general tendency is to keep it bland to make the most folks happy.

As we drove through the parking lot, we were stunned to see how busy it was.  The private lot was packed and we took the last parking space.  (There were still cars coming in as we walked into the restaurant.)  Could there be private event?\n\nAs I took a quick peek in, it didn't seem like it was closed for a party.  We took the last of the two tables available, which was our luck since the rest of our dinner there was a large group of people waiting.  Checking out our fellow diners, and we were surrounded by Indians and non-Indians.  This place was was ridiculously busy!  As a result, it took awhile to get our orders in and for our food to come.  It looked like a new restaurant inside with the simple decorations and complementing paint choices.  (As other yelper mentioned, they just renovated.)  A lone TV behind the bar showed Bollywood videos throughout the meal.  They also have two smaller rooms off to the sides.\n\nThe Husband and I both ordered a Mango Lassi \"Sweet yogurt based shake made with mango pulp.\" ($3.95) to start and it was probably one of the best I've had.  Presented in a copper cup, I would say they give you more than other places do.\n\nWe both chose a dinner special, which comes with chicken or dal soup; choice of bread - plain naan, garlic naan, or roti; basmatic rice and mango custard.\n\nThe Dal Soup \"A traditional veggie soup with delicately spiced lentils.\" was simple, but tasty.  A nice start to our meal.\n\nThe Garlic Naan was a generous amount, and we actually had leftovers.  It was tasty with lots of garlic.\n\nMy Vegetable Dinner Special included \"Saag Paneer, Navratan Korma, Dal Makhani, Raita\" ($19.95).  The Saag Paneer \"Creamy spicy spinach with chunks of homemade cheese.\" is usually a favorite of The Husband's, so I let him have most of it.  It was good, but not my favorite. The Navratan Korma \"Mixed veggies with cheese in a creamy sauce with cashews, almonds & raisins.\" was a favorite though, probably because I love creamy sauces in Indian cooking. The Dal Makhani \"Lentil delicacy flavored with onions, tomatoes, ginger, garlic & cream.\" was also very good as well, because I love lentils and cream!  The Raita \"Yogurt seasoned with cumin, cucumber, tomatoes & mint.\" has never been something I could enjoy, so The Husband enjoyed most of it.\n\nThe Husband went for the Rack of Lamb Dinner Special \"Rack of Lamb, Malai Kofta, Aloo Matar\" ($25.95).  The Malai Kofta \"Cheese & vegetable balls in an aromatic gravy.\" was a bit interesting, as we would say.  It's considered a \"House Favorite\" but it was just a bit weird for us.  The Aloo Matar \"Green peas cooked with diced potatoes and aromatic spices in a curry sauce.\" was yummy, as most Indian curry dishes are.  The rack of lamb was also good, and loaded with tons of onions and bell peppers, which The Husband ate up.\n\nThe Mango Custard was a light simple liquid custard drink with chunks of fruit in it.  Not exactly what I call a custard, but more like a thicker lassi.\n\nService was okay - when our waiter finally took our order, the food took awhile and our bill took awhile too.  The women serving the food could use a little brush up on how to clear a table.  Simple things like clearing the soup bowls before bringing out the other food might help a bit.  We were seated at a small table, so it was crowded with all our mini dishes.\n\nOverall, India Palace served up some good Indian food.

So he brings everything from started to the sabji and naan in order. The starters were okay and sabji was totally bland.

I've dined there a handful of times to see if I agree.\n\nAlthough I wouldn't normally want to hang out on East Twain, one of the city's most dangerous areas, I will always take unnecessary risks for good food. The restaurant sticks out as the only kept up, interesting piece of architecture in that area, so it's hard to miss.\n\nYou will forget about the exterior surroundings upon entering as the decor is immediately welcoming. The walls are painted in warm, cheery earth tones that are beautifully complemented by heavy amber drapes and rich, dark woods. There is a comfortable full-service bar you can enjoy a drink at before your meal, making India palace stand out from many of its competitors.\n\nMy favorite thing to get here is the dosa, a thin pancake made from chickpeas. It is of such great diameter that it must be folded upon itself so it can almost fit on your plate, and it is eaten by tearing off more reasonably sized pieces. The only other place I've seen dosa is at India Masala in the Riviera (same owners, I believe), so I highly recommend ordering it here. You can have your dosa stuffed with an incendiary potato filling, or get the plain Papper Dosa, which I prefer (both $10.95). It is served with an addictive coconut 'chutney,' which is more like a coconut puree, and sambar, a tangy tamarind based soup/dip. Even without the accompaniments, the dosa serves as a fantastic vehicle for eating your main selections and proves to be an interesting alternative to naan.\n\nThe Chicken Tikka Masala ($14.95) and Mushroom Matar ($12.95) are fantastic, but I think the chef's abilities stand out most in the Lamb Rogan Josh ($15.95). The tomato broth is reminiscent of an authentic, slow-cooked Italian marinara that has been spiked with exotic spices, and the flavors continuously evolve in your mouth, revealing the sauce's complexity. The lamb is perfectly tender to boot, and hasn't a hint of the gaminess that can come with lower quality cuts.\n\nSo, is India Palace the best Indian restaurant in town? I can't affirmatively say yes (I had a spinach soup that was inedible and they don't use many fresh veggies in their lunch buffet), but it is definitely a contender.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 4, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "Finally after several years of going to lunch at another nearby Indian restaurant we tried India Palace.

At about $13, India Palace will cost you that extra dollar or two over Mint (which is more Nepalese, if I'm not mistaken), Mt. Everest or India Oven, but not even Ghandi's excellent fare is close in quality and variety.  Every day there is a pilaf, lentils, Tandoori Chicken, a Saag dish, a Korma, a Tikka, a Masala, a Salad, both Mango Custard and Kheer, Naan and Sauces (Raita, Tamarind, Mint and a few others.).  For a vegetarian, this is one of the best buffets for you.  The break down always has at least 4-5 vegetarian selections in addition to the rice and lentils - most others are not nearly as diverse.  For the carnivore, the selection is by no means meager - at least 1-2 chicken dishes plus tandoor and a lamb or goat dish.  Alone, the spread is great, but, having eaten here dozens of times, I have to comment that the clencher for me is the fact that I can't tell a difference in quality between the lunch food and the dinner food.  This can't be said, in my opinion, of others.  \n\nSecondly, I find, despite the opinions of others, the dinner to be reasonably priced for the quality.  If you consider that Indian restaurants are usually priced well-above other non-European, Ethnic cuisines, it is easy to think of them as pricey, but the complexity of Indian curries and the time-to-cook makes them cheap if you compare them to a steak.  Also, if you consider the consistent quality of the food, India Palace is worth the extra buck you MIGHT pay over Bollywood or Mint.

Vick really took care of us and, having waited on my friends for the past four years, exuded a certain cameraderie that really brought everyone together. He made recommendations, made sure we wanted for nothing, and kept the meal moving forward without making us feel rushed in any way.\n\nFOOD:\n\nThe food was mostly good. Not great, but good. Tasty enough to share amongst friends over a couple bottles of wine, and some good conversation.\n\nThe paneer pakora (cheese squares made of 2 layers of cheese with some thin herb/veggie spread in between, then battered and fried) was disappointing. Maybe the squares are too big and cool off too fast; it quickly becomes a hunk of room-temperature fried cheese. It didn't make think of Indian food as much as any other fried cheese product around town.\n\nThe chicken pakora was much like the cheese; it seemed like any other fried chicken strip. The flavors want to be there, but it's just not executed well enough. Not impressed.\n\nThe samosas were really tasty. The crusts were flaky and the stuffing was generous and flavorful. Layered flavors, a great kick of spice, and the textures were good. A highlight, for sure.\n\nThe sauces (mint, tamarind, and chili) were fantastic! Really, really flavorful and fresh. We refilled our sauce dishes at least twice. Best part of the meal.\n\nThe chicken tikka masala was tasty. Not the best in town, but tasty. We ordered one medium and one hot. The hot was truly HOT... pushing the line of too much (and therefore hiding some of the flavors). Still, the flavors were good and the chicken was tender. \n\nThe peas pulao (basmati rice with peas and cashews) was pretty damn good, actually. I tasted a bite with a little of everything and really loved the freshness, the combination of flavors. Great complement.\n\nThe breads were good (my companions had to try at least four kinds?). I tasted a few small bits here and there and found them good. Again, not great. But good, worth trying.\n\nCOST/VALUE:\n\nThe apps and bread are priced well, especially for groups who want to get a few things and share. The entrees, however, are overpriced for what we received: appetizer size at entree prices. The tikka masala was tiny for what they charge and the rice was a la carte (also a bit pricey for what you get). Bad juju there, as your \"entree\" becomes a $20+ dish but it's just not a $20+ place. It wasn't my dime, but $200 for a group of four is a bit excessive for a place like this, even considering the wine.\n\nOVERALL:\n\n Food (and value of same) made me think it was a 2-2.5 (edible, but I have had much better...) but the service and atmosphere was easily a 4.5!

My favorites include Keema which is naan with minced lamb, Garlic and Poori which is fried whole wheat bread.  The naan rounds out what seem to some as small portions.  When you have naan, your entree of choice with the aromatic Basmati rice you have a very generous serving of food.\n\nNo matter what you order, I recommend getting rice as a nice complement to the sauces and curries.  I'm not a vegetarian, but enjoy the spices of the Channa (chickpeas) Masala.  The goat Saag in spinach and herb is delicious.  The meat is so tender and juicy it can best most steaks.  I can say that about the chicken and lamb as well.\n\nTo top it off, India Palace serves a great selection of beers from India including Hayward 5000, Taj Mahal and King Fisher.  I find Taj Mahal the most refreshing almost sweet tasting, and it goes well if you like your food spicy.\n\nBottom line: very attentive service, delicious variety, very tender, very juicy meats and Indian beer.

Having heard the good reviews over the years, we decided to give it a try. I checked the yelp app on my phone and saw that with 'check-in' on the app you get 1 free appetizer or cocktail with purchase. The reviews were also favorable so in we went. We arrived at 5pm and the place was seemingly in between shifts so we were sat promptly. \n\nI noticed on signage that there were Happy Hour specials until 6pm so I asked the hostess about them. She replied, \"Happy Hour? Why not? .. You can get buy 1 get one free on appetizers. \" Great, It was about the same as the deal on the app so we ordered. \n\nWe had Veggie and Lamb Samosas, very nice as well as a few other items including garlic naan bread, Chicken Briyani, (Chicken mixed with Basmati rice with spices, cashews & vegetables) and Chicken Tikka Masala, (Tandoori white chicken marinated in yogurt & spices, simmered in a creamy tomato sauce.) Pretty standard stuff. We even opted for some traditional desserts and Indian Beer.\n\nAll in all the food was really good and tasty and I was very satisfied and full. Service was a bit off, but I think that may have been due to the language barrier, and sometimes the server would suggest an item, and then bring something else. In this case he offered a couple of different beers and then brought something altogether different. It wasn't a huge deal as the beers were good and 3 of us were sharing so they went fast.\n\nWhat was strange was when the bill arrived, I asked again about the Happy Hour specials, as the bill had not been adjusted. Our server was no where to be found and the server presenting the check had no idea what I was talking about. I got up to ask the hostess that seated us about the specials, (she was the one that said \"why not\",) and she acted as though she didn't know what I was talking about.. then reluctantly adjusted the bill. \n\nThe 'new' server brought over the adjusted bill and seemed pretty aggravated at me. Possibly for asking about the discount? I don't know but it was not a happy presentation of the new check. We paid and left. \n\nI would go again, possibly for a buffet situation, as I wasn't completely satisfied with the service, but the food was very good. I think at least one of my friends wouldn't return due to the service. We weren't asking much but the hasty and unhappy presentation of out adjusted bill kind of put us off a bit.

No less than 4 police cars with sirens blaring were pulling 3 guys out of a car next door and had them pinned to the ground at gunpoint. I mention it, because I know the neighborhood well, and this has to be one of the less savory sections.

So I grabbed a friend and went.  He had tried Indian previously and knew to order the garlic naan.  Delicious.  He ordered Tikka Masala.  I ordered Chicken Sagwala.  Both were quite good.  I ordered mine with medium spice.  It provided that great warming sensation without being too spicy.  Though I did need some Tums shortly after.  The meal started with the aforementioned naan as well as something I can best describe as Indian chips and salsa.  Crispy little pieces of flat bread with three different sauces.  One was very strong with the red chili flavor.  One was heavy on the mint.  The third I recall as being sweeter and almost fruity.  All very good.  I was surprised at how much food I received.  I was very full afterwards.  I had to walk around the Boulevard Mall for a while before continuing on the my next stop (see my review for Hofbrauhaus).  After eating at India Palace, I knew I was hooked.  The flavors are intense but balanced so well.  I drive by some times when in the University neighborhood and I am always tempted to stop in.

I had read all the great reviews about the Chicken Tikka Masala and how good the garlic naan was so we were pretty excited about it.\n\nAs we entered we weren't really greeted politely, we were kind of looked at like we were lost.  I asked the waiter if we could have a table for 2, so he pointed and said booth 3, so we walked to the nearest empty booth he was possibly referring to.  We sat for about a couple minutes till the same waiter came over and said \"you're here for the buffet right?\" We looked at each other confused because it was our first time there so I asked him if we were able to order from the menu, he looked annoyed and went over and grabbed a couple menus and brought them over.\n\nMy friend and I were already set on ordering ourselves the Chicken Tikka Masala because of the great reviews and the garlic naan as well. We waited a few more minutes then a different waiter approached us and asked us if we were here for the buffet.  I politely said no we are first timers and not too sure what was being served at the buffet.  He then described all the choices, I asked if the chicken tikka masala was available and he had said no, I also had asked if the garlic naan would be available at the buffet and he said no they would have to make it in the back and bring it out.  He was really trying to push us to eat at the buffet but we were really set on trying the dish we wanted.  So he took our order of 2 Chicken Tikka Masalas and the Garlic Naan.\n\nI then asked about the free Mango Lassi you receive if you check in on yelp.  My friend and I both showed our check-ins, then he says that only one person per table with a coupon gets a free Mango Lassi (which was NOT stated on the coupon or app that it only applies for 1 person. SO if you're going with a friend or friends, be prepared that only ONE of you will get a free Mango Lassi if you check in here)\n\nDuring the time while waiting for our order no one approaches us and let's us know our food will be ready soon, or to re-fill our water cups or to check in on us at all.  \n\nFinally our food comes out and it's a pretty small bowl of the Chicken Tikka Masala, a few small pieces of boneless chicken submerged in like 5 ounces of their sauce and spices, but it smells delicious, then a basket of the naan which really wasn't much since we both shared two pieces each, and a bowl of rice to share between the both of us. (I thought per order of a dish you get your own rice, but I thought wrong.)\n\nFood definitely 5 Stars.  Being a first timer I was satisfied, but for the price of 2 bowls of chicken tikka masala, sharing a bowl of rice and an order of garlic naan (which came out to be a little over $20 each) I'm disappointed.  Not too sure if he had charged us the dinner price and gave us a lunch size meal. \n\nAll in all my friend and I both enjoyed the Flavors of Indian food for the first time, but will probably NEVER come back here again.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Whoever heard of serving Chicken Masala without rice?

The curries were equally awful. I had the chicken bhuna, which had a super watery sauce, and the chicken was really chewy and stringy, and there was a layer of oil on the whole thing making it taste rank to be honest. The rice was also over cooked and was pretty soggy. To their credit though, the nan bread was tasty was was the best part of the meal - but it would be pretty difficult to mess that up! \n\nThe meal was really expensive too, with two courses coming to about \u00a317 - really not worth it.

There was about 5 parties there ranging from 1 to 6 people pet table.\n\nThe staff seemed pretty bored, which added to the boring ambience. There's nothing that makes it scream, \"Indian restaurant\". \n\nOur wait staff was pretty good, always there when we needed.\n\nThey gave us a little too much time to over view the menu.\n\nI'll start off with the appetizers.\n\nThere's a complimentary plate of a baked type of chip? That's served with 2 different sauces. One was sweet and red like a thin chutney. The other was spicier and green like a salsa verde. Overall it reminded me of chips and salsa. \n\nWe ordered meat Samosas to start. They're pretty much ground beef empanadas with Indian seasonings. Overall it was good, but definitely not a stand out I'd go back for. Very mild.\n\nI ordered a tasting dinner.\n\nThis came with: basmati rice, naan, a goat curry, a chicken curry, and a shrimp curry. It was also served with a cool, cucumbery, white sauce and a sweet dessert cup.\n\nThe portions were good; enough to share.\n\nAlthough it was all really good.. The food definitely tasted like it just came out of serving pots. The only one that seemed like the meat was stewed in the curry was the goat. The chicken and shrimp servings came off as if the chicken or shrimp was added into the sauce before being brought out. \n\nAlso, the three different curries seemed to be of varying heat. The goat was most mild, then the chicken, and then the shrimp being the spiciest. \n\nI'd definitely recommend getting this \"meat dinner\" if you've never had Indian food. \n\nYou get a little taste of everything.\n\nThe menu was definitely hard to understand. There's one goat,  one veggie, one seafood, and one chicken section each with about 6-8 different options to have your choice of entree in.\n\nThe descriptions really don't give any idea of what to expect from what you order. I.e. Chicken in spicy curry sauce VS. Chicken in very spicy curry sauce.\n\nI hated the seating of this place. They should definitely get a new interior designer. The tables are so close with no booths! I felt like I was unintentionally eaves dropping everyone's conversations.\n\nFor food: I'd definitely give the food a 4.5 out of five. The only complaint would be my food wasnt served completely piping hot. One dish was warm while the others weren't ect. But taste was definitely awesome! All the curries were different like I ordered three different dishes and eating with naan or rice changed the tastes too.\n\nService: 4 out of 5. It was satisfactory and I have no complaints, but nothing spectacular.\n\nPrice: 3 out of 5. I'm a huge fan of Thai curry, but it just doesn't seem worth it for the price. My meal with one mango lassi(which was underwhelming) and Samosas($7) was about $45. It's about 2 cups of curry, rice, and naan for $21-24 dollars. \n\nI would definitely go back! But only when I want to splurge. I'd rather go get Thai curry :]", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "My Girl loves her some Indian food, so she suggested (by waking me up) that we should go to India Oven for lunch and then some java afterwards.

LoL - \"Laughs Out Loud\" ;p\n\nAs I was saying the buffet was small and limited and ranged from dried up meat kebabs to nice tender Chicken Tikka Masala, A mutton stew, along with the various vegetarian dishes like Palak Paneer (spinach and farmers cheese), Sabji Samosas (vegetable fritters), Daal Makhni (creamed lentils) and a few others. So overall the buffet was home to maybe 12-15 items and their Naan bread does rock. My girl also ordered the Sweet \"Lassi\" homemade yogurt drink, which she loved.\n\nIt was slow so the waiter was always there when we needed a drink refill and was courteous when doing so.

My request was something that wasn't on the menu, I wanted to have Keema Chicken.   \n\nso, I called 2 other places before I landed to the India Oven.   The first 2 places I called, both said No, can't make keema chicken because it's not on the menu.   \n\nAnd finally I called India Oven, I asked the same question, he said \"No problem, we can make Keema chicken for you\"   \n\nThat's the attitude!   Keema chicken normally is NOT on the menu at many Indian restaurants.  It is because Keema(means ground/minced) chicken is more like home cooking and not really the type of food that the restaurants serves. (I don't know why they shouldn't!) \n\nAs I eat alots of Indian food and know exactly what I wanted to eat, I didn't even check the menu.  I ordered Keema chicken, Plain Naan, Rice, Papadums and Raita. \n\nTheir Keema chicken was good.  A lots of ginger as I expected.  Exactly what I had in mind.  I wish they put green pees but was not a big deal. \nPapadum was spicy and crispy.  I ordered extra so that I can snack tomorrow night!!   \n\nNaan was great, fresh and chewy. Just as Naan bread should taste.  I stick with plain, I don't like those Garlic and the other flavor ones because I want to taste the floury doughy Naan.  It was really good.  I only wish if they didn't use so much oil when they bake the Naans but not a big deal, I liked it alot.

Me and my fiancee came here for V-Day after hearing it was one of the most romantic restaurants in Vegas.  The location (Sahara and Commercial Center) is a bit of a grungy area but we go there to eat at Komol's quite often so the less than romantic exterior didn't bother me too much.  The interior is dimly lit and pretty cozy as well.  We got seated right away and had our orders taken within the next 10 minutes.  We had a vegetable (carrot, onion, and parsley) ensemble for our starter dishes which was quite spicy but very tasty.  I also had the vegetarian stir fry which was brought out on a steaming hot plate and smelled just as good as it tasted!  This dish had a typical stir fry 'onion-y' taste and came complete with cauliflower, red and green peppers, grilled tofu, and more parsley.  My main dish was a vegetarian curry and it was awesome!  I also had garlic naan and kashmiri naan which was also killer!  The kashmiri naan was naan with a cherry-like filling and it wasn't too sweet, complementing the buttery naan exterior very nicely.  I also had the rice pudding for dessert and it was standard like other rice puddings I've had before.  Food aside, the service was pretty good.  They were a bit slow in bringing our food out and that was a bit irritating.  We were there for almost 2 hours and we are definitely not slow eaters!  They got my order wrong three times during our visit.  The wine was the wrong one and decided to let that one slide but they brought out the wrong appetizer and wrong curry.  Still not sure how that happened, but I let them know I got the wrong dishes and they gladly replaced them with the right ones and pretty quickly, at that.  They also added a 10% percent discount on our bill and gave us extra naan.  Now that's service!  We didn't ask for the discount or naan so that was a real pleasant surprise.  They had a Valentine's special going so 4 dishes and a dessert with a glass of wine came out to be $40 a person which was actually pretty good considering the regular prices of the plates which averaged around $12 dollars each.

Something that was both new to us was the Uttapam, a thick pancake with a sour-like taste that was topped with a bit of tomato and onion.  Traditionally it's made from rice that has been fermented, which explains it's tangy taste.\n\nFinishing off the meal was the Kheer, \"Traditional Indian rice pudding with nuts, flavored with cardamon and rose.\"\n\nAt one point, I helped myself to the water pitcher.

I also enjoyed heaps of my favorite Saag Paneer (creamy spinach with chunks of cheese).  Usually, at buffets, I find the Saag Paneer to be dried out, but here it was very wet.  For meat, I really liked the goat curry.  The meat was pungent and very tender.  The sauce was tasty and spicy and compliment well with the rice.

Now, I would have completely understood if she wrote a quick note on the side with the calculations for 15%, 18%, and 20% tip on the total bill.  But to write in the tip on a table for two just because we were using a groupon is uncalled for.  My friend, who was paying the difference, was so mad, so crossed it off and gave her a 13% tip.  \n\nLastly, when the owner is serving me, I feel less bad about the tip considering that is not how she makes her wages, unlike normal wait staff.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "The BF and I have been watching a lot about Indian food lately so we're on a kick for some.

Decided to go for lunch today since I'm still embarked on \"Las Vegas Indian Lunch Buffet Tour 2012\" and inexplicably had not tried it in long enough to warrant a review.\n\nI was actually very impressed with the times I went to Namaste for dinner.  One of those occasions would have warranted a 5 and the other a 4, so I should be ashamed of myself for not posting a review then and instead hitting them with a 3 for today's lunch buffet, but that's exactly what I'm going to do.\n\nLet me start off by saying service was fantastic, and the gentleman who seated us was very friendly and made sure my iced tea stayed flowing (iced tea was delicious by the way, it was one of those fruit flavored kinds which I'm not certain of, but very tasty nonetheless) and that there was always a plate of hot naan at the table.  The first portion we received of naan was excellent.  Soft, fresh and with a great flavor.  The 2nd plate was a little overcooked and therefore too crispy for my liking, but overall the naan was fine.  \n\nAs for the selections on the actual buffet, I was a tad disappointed.  A minor gripe is layout wise the rice was at the end of the line.  I think it works much better at the front so I can keep piling all the various curries and dals over the rice, instead of vice versa which is what I ended up doing.   As for the food itself, I was a big fan of the Saag (hooray for it not being Saag Paneer like I normally find at buffets as I can't handle the cheese).   I also thought the Potato Pakora was delicious and unique to any pakora offerings I've had elsewhere.  The chicken curry was a fine version, and the piece of chicken I ended up with were very tender and flavorful.   The rest of it was fairly average to me.  It could just be a preference thing, but I found most of the other offerings to be very thin in consistency, almost soup like, while I guess I tend to prefer a thicker dal or curry with my rice.   When I'd try to scoop a spoonful of most of these onto my plate, they immediately would go all over the entire plate and mix into everything else.  If you've read my other reviews you know I generally like this when I eat Indian food, but the point is I like to do it MYSELF, to be the master of my own domain so to speak.  \n\nGenerally I also just found the offerings limited compared to my favorite lunch buffets Mt Everest and Mint.  I'm a samosa fiend so not having those effects me (and Namaste makes a fine version from what I've had at dinner).   I would have also liked to see more meat offerings (they had 3 chicken dishes, but 2 were prepared in butter or yogurt so they were off limits to my sensitive, annoying tummy).   It's quite possible I caught them on a day with a selection that just didn't suit my needs, but even if that's the case the fact that I've never caught Everest or Mint in that situation speaks volumes to me.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Myself and Wife had visited Vegas for ??? - Yes Pure fun and stumbled on Namaste Indian Cuisine.

Wow, this is a popular place, I thought!\n\nSo we turned up, starving and excited, on a wet and miserable night to a near-empty restaurant. I could see that multiple tables had the Thali experience menu on the table and realised that the restaurant wasn't fully booked per se, but clearly they were limiting what time and when groupon vouchers could be used. Hmmm. Fine. \n\nThe thali menu itself was six choices - if you were vegetarian, you had to like paneer, as there was no other choice, although there were four options to choose from (from memory) - Sukutha (my choice), spinach sensation, tikka or something else - essentially a sauce with the meat of your choice (or cheese). Other options were butter chicken or a lamb dish.

We were served our main after 9pm. Now, that would be fine if this was freshly cooked, but clearly each dish came from a larger vat of food, so why it took so long to deliver, I have no idea.
