Wood paneling adorns the walls, as do 4-5 televisions.\n\nThe place is a seat-yourself joint; we chose a small table in the middle of the restaurant. We sat for about 5 minutes before a young waitress asked if she could help us.\n\nBeers were ordered, along with cheese curds. The beers came out quickly, and I'm not sure how this is possible, but the beers here are amazing. They taste better than any I've had elsewhere.\n\nCurds were delivered minutes later. They were piping hot, battered, and delicious. Seem to be identical to the curds that The Avenue Bar serves. No ranch, but that's ok.\n\nWe ordered our food: two burgers and a large fries. The jukebox plays a nice mix of 80's and 90's music; we've heard Dave Mathews, John Cougar, and Natalie Merchant.\n\nOur waitress is a bit inattentive; beers sat empty for a good 10 minutes; another waitress stopped by to get us a refill. There goes her tip.\n\nBurgers came out, and they are amazing. Obviously made on site by hand, and assembled from steak trimmings. Buns are delish as well. But, wow- the burgers are unreal. Fries (crinkle cut) are plentiful, crispy, and awesome. A+ on food.\n\nThe table next to us is enjoying tenderloin and prime rib; both look amazing- easily better than any high-dollar steakhouse.\n\nSo, time for the summary...\n\nAmbience: 5 stars.\nFood: 5 stars- delicious and perfect\nService: 2 stars; our waitress sucks\nBeer selection: 4 stars\nValue: can't comment; haven't received a bill yet, but burgers are $4.75, fries were $2.75, curds were $4.95.\n\nWe'll be back.

I'll definitely try the tenderloin next time!!\n\n\nOakcrest = WIN.\n\n\nUpdate: So the service continued to stink, even when we sat at the bar after finishing our dinner.  There were 4 bartenders/waitstaff and yet our beers sat empty for 20+ minutes, so we left.  But the food will draw us back, even if the service leaves much to be desired.

For months, we heard from people about how great the fish fry was, so we decided to try it tonight.\n\nKnowing how small the place is, we made certain to arrive early.  When we walked in the door at 4:30pm, the place was already nearly packed with people.  We found a table and waited for a waitress to arrive.  Within a few minutes, we had placed our drink orders (2 Miller Lites) and were browsing the menu, pondering our fish options.\n\nThe waitress came back to take our order - we decided on the baked tilapia with a baked potato, and the deep fried cod with fries and coleslaw (you get two sides with the fish fry).\n\nFood arrived about 20 minutes later; tilapia was a miniscule, single piece of fish that was nicely baked and dusted with paprika.  The cod plate featured two average sized fillets and one pint-sized fillet, with a mound of fries.\n\nThe tilapia, while tasty, was an appetizer at best, and definitely not worth the $12 price.  The cod was largely flavorless; the breading was soggy on two pieces and extremely crispy on the third, but soggy or otherwise, it featured zero - none - zip - nada flavor.  It was as bland as what you'd find in a cafeteria.\n\nFries were spectacular, as usual - crisp, hot, flavorful.  We never saw a waitress again, other than to drop off the bill, which was a staggering $30 for two fish fries and two beers.\n\nOakcrest's Fish Fry = FAIL (other food = great)\n\nService = 1 star (basically non-existent)\nFood = 2 stars (the fries saved the day; fish was bland and tasteless)\nValue = 0 stars ($12 for tilapia, $11 for cod; small portions)\nMisc = 1 star (extremely over-rated fish fry)\n\nWe'll stick to visiting the Oakcrest for burgers, sandwiches, steaks, and the fries.

A 1920's- 1940's exterior design gives way to wood paneling and a multitude of flat screens indoors. To the right, a bar with a 90-degree bend and made of the same wood as the paneling dominates to area. To the left, a modest dining room sits. The room is crowded with tables and seating is close to your neighbor. Coat hooks abound. Tables are in the center and high tops ring around the walls. It's certainly cozy, and in my opinion has a bit of that northwoods supper club feel, albeit in a downscale sort of way.\n\nI went on a Saturday with one partner and we were seated after entry at the last available table. Looking around at the dinners on other tables, I was impressed by the quality of the food as well as the portions. I saw the grilled walleye pike at one table and it looked as if they gave them a whole fish. Another table had a top sirloin that was about 2.5 inches thick and cooked perfectly medium rare along with a truly colossal portion of prime rib, also perfectly medium rare. Good signs!\n\nAfter ordering, the salad course came first. Typical iceberg with a few shreds of red cabbage and 3 large, fresh carrot sticks. The ranch dressing was homemade and fresh. The vinaigrette a true vinaigrette of oil, vinegar, and fresh herbs and also homemade but note that the other dressings available are not from scratch.\n\nAfter salad came our main course. I had the prime rib, medium-rare; my friend went with well done. There is only one cut, and it's a king cut at least. The thick, red meat came swimming in its own juices and had a mild, almost delicate flavor. Hers was well done, but she said it was still juicy and tender. She declared it the best she had ever had. For sides, I went with a baked potato and she with sweet potato fries, which was a slight upcharge. My potato was mediocre, but the few fries I stole were excellent. They were crispy outside and downright creamy in the center with a mild flavor. They may have been coated in something to enhance crispiness, but were good.\n\nService was thorough and very attentive. The crowd seemed to be very 'neighborhood' when we were there and many young children were present. They were all well-behaved even though their parents were at another table.\n\nI'm a fan. This place was low-key, fairly priced and well-served by an attentive staff. Dinner looked great and tasted great.

I get it, I'm a vegetarian so I am not the target audience here.  However, I do get 50% of the household vote on where we go to dinner, so I've got that going for me.  \n\nCocktails: Happy Hour from 3pm-6pm every day (whoo hoo!) so $3 Wisconsin beers and various $3 well cocktails aren't a bad deal.  However, $8.75 for a Jack on the rocks is NOT a good deal, it doesn't matter how generous they are when they fill that cup.  Ouch. \n\nAppetizers: We ordered the spinach artichoke dip which was more dry than creamy and really was more like a spread than a dip.  A bit heavy on the dill and, while perfectly edible, made us wish we'd tried something else. \n\nVegetarian Entrees: Hmm.  You could get a dinner salad which is essentially a large version of their side salad.  For $8 I think it should be a bit fancier than iceberg lettuce, carrots, radishes and cheese.  Alternately, there are two pasta entrees (Mac n' cheese or pasta w/veggies, $13 each).  I think pasta as a veg entr\u00e9e is always a bummer as it's one of the few things I can successfully cook on my own at home. Sigh.\n\nMeat Entrees: See prior reference to drool-inducing prime rib.  I do hear about it all week, so it must be pretty darn good.  ($21/10oz, $27/16oz).  \n\nBOTTOM LINE: Not my favorite place, too expensive for what we (or should I say I) end up with.

What year is it?\n\nThe red sauce they give you is OK, but it is more like a shrimp sauce, I'm sure it would be great on that. It definitely does not belong on fish.\n\nTheir Hamburgers though, are quite good and very inexpensive. If you go to Petes, get one of those. Skip the fish, it's awful.

They were very thin and mostly crust.  When tasting without the sauce they were bland.  With the sauce, which may be the best thing about Pete's, they were quite good.  For a two piece fish meal with fries (thin, shoestring) you get a tiny little container of red sauce (not ketchup and not cocktail sauce, but something like spicy ketchup) that isn't enough to flavor everything, but you can buy another small container for 10 cents or so (or up to 14 oz for a little more).  The fries were under salted which isn't bad based on different people's taste, but lack of salt packets (or catchup or other condiments) readily available (some available behind counter if you wait in the line again) was a pain.\n\nThe two stars are because fish n chips don't appear to be their strong suit, or miss the mark of my expectations of some type of east coast or English fish and chips.

Keep in mind I told you I like fishy fish, but this thing was fresh, juicy, full of meat, and perfectly matched my seafood craving.

This thing was meaty, a little salted, and perfectly flavored. The remoulade was excellent. \nThe Crab cake- It had a ton of crab in it. The only one I've had that was better was in Maryland overlooking the water. Dipped in the remoulade this more than just good. \nThe Clam Chowder- It spilled in the car, in the bag, so I brought it in and ate the chowder with a spoon out of the bag. It was that good. \n\nThe Very Good- \nThe House Fish- Really good. Probably the best I've had. What's weird is that I think the excellence of the oyster and soft shell crab overshadowed this.

And we decided to try it out.\n\nAt first glance, the interior was.....kinda plain. It didn't really have a \"pier\" feel to it and take away the small amount of wall decorations, you get an empty room with cheep tables and chairs everywhere. But it was busy. And everyone seemed happy with what they were eating. \n\nI noticed the rather large beer selection they had going on. Cool little spot to have a social brunch with some friends, plus they had a flat screen which probably played sports. \n\nAlso it smelled good in there. I and my family were really hungry, (especially my daughter), and nothing teased our appetites like the lingering smell of fresh seafood being cooked in the back. \n\nSo we made our choices, sat down and our food arrived. We got the platter sampler, which had a variety of fried sea foods. We got the large clam chowder inside of the fresh baked bread bowl. And we got a large fried shrimp burrito. The kids got a kids meal plate each which was very small. So warning to anybody, if you have a kid 7 and up, get him or her a normal plate because I promise you they will be disappointed. \n\nOn the flip side, our sampler plate was huge. April and I had a concern that we couldn't share our platter since only one of each seafood was in the description on the menu, but our fears were put to rest when we were rewarded with very large samples. So the sampler plate was delicious. The hush puppies we fresh. Also the sampler had chicken, which was OK. A little dry. \n\nThe clam chowder was very good. So was the bread bowl. But We felt like it was too cold. Like they should have heated it up more. And in fact when I asked them too, they gave us another free bowl of hotter chowder which was pretty cool. The staff was very friendly by the way. They answered all our questions. They didn't argue. The checked in on us every once in a while. Good staff. \n\nThe highlight food was the fried shrimp burrito. April and I both loved it. We used to get our shrimp burritos from Rubios but after the one from Pier 83, we may have found our new provider. It was well made too. Not too soggy, (until around the end of it). Good amount of shrimp. Not over fried. Perfect. \n\nOverall this place was a fantastic find. A little pricey for us average people, but not too pricey for a family out night. Will I be back? Yes.

I didn't think one taco would be enough so I added on a side salad for somewhere around $3.00. My taco was very packed with LOTS of very fresh shredded cabbage but my fish was terribly dry but edible and was plain but on the top of all that cabbage and some diced tomatoes was a tasty creamy chipotle sauce and on the side was a fresh made pico. They called it jumbo and it was big but it was the same size as the other tacos my husband ordered. The side salad was freshly made and not from a bag.\n\nThe fried fish tacos my husband had (shrimp and maui maui) were much better than the  halibut. They were set up the same way but he asked for the creamy sauce of the side. For my husband he thought they had too much cabbage in them and he scooped half the cabbage out. \n\nI've been here before but it was a while back.

Halibut = slightly overcooked (easily made up for by risotto and beurre blanc).\nHubs reports his entree was \"very, very good,\" but I didn't taste it because I was too busy savoring EVERY molecule on my plate.\n\nWe did have to ask for the sourdough that comes with steam pots (Tide Roast), but when it finally showed up, it was fresh and warm and chewy and sour and wonderful.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed an icy Mudshark white ale with my meal, but the Santan Devils Ale gave DH a splitting headache, strangely... so odd.\n\nWrapped things up with the bread pudding, served hot with vanilla ice cream and a very light drizzle of caramel sauce. I adored it, but DH wanted more caramel sauce.\n\nPlease keep in mind, we are splitting hairs here and being ultra critical of some seriously delicious food. \nSadly, it's so hard to come by a decent sauce these days, and High Tide nailed it. Their chef is not playing around.\n\nServer Matthew took excellent care of us and made us feel like the most important couple in the restaurant.\n\nAll in all, if I had died on my way home after this meal, I would have had zero regrets.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Nice atmosphere, clean, great staff, and the food was terrific.

High Tide gets a few things VERY right.  Let's start off with the beer selection featuring Green Flash IPA, Firestone Walker DBA and IPA and several other selections from Stone and other top notch breweries.  Next up are the oysters which are fresh and shucked very well.  They usually try and carry an East and West coast oyster which is cool to split and taste the amazing variety they have not unlike the vast differences you would find in wine of the same grape.  I'm a huge fan of their quality and they are served correctly with lemon and three sauces based on your taste.  A cocktail with a huge chunk of fresh horseradish, a shallot vinaigrette, and a creamy horseradish.  I just use the chunk horseradish and lemon and it is wonderful.  .  \n\nThe other day I had a dz raw oysters and an oyster poboy which was also amazing.  A little heavy on the bread but the oysters and the pickles etc were spot on.  The fried okra was a nice add and something I have not seen in restaurants in years.  \n\nThe prices are reasonable considering the size of the place and the high level of freshness they provide in the food.  This brings me to the only possible negative which is a lack of warmth in the restaurant.  Perhaps they just need some plants and filler but it is a large open space with high ceilings and you feel somewhat like you are at a museum.  The booths seem a little too \"old school\" for me but no matter because I think the huge bar is the only place to sit.  You can also watch them make some of the foods in very cool steam pots they have right there in the bar.  \n\nService is a notch above most with staff that are well educated and a little more mature than you would normally find in a AZ restaurant.  Reminds me a bit of NYC where you have refined gentlemen as waiters rather than kids going to school.  Service usually shines here from people with a deep understanding of the food and drink.\n\nLastly they need a bike rack outside being right in the center of town.  It's an easy ride for many within the area and they have a huge windowed area where people can keep an eye on things.  Would love to cruise over for some oysters and beer and dash home without putting a key in the car.

Very nicely done; color scheme was pretty and felt nautical, finishings were high end and tasteful.  We found it very comfortable.

The bar is very large and the boil pots are there manned with a chef for some of the dishes.\n\nWe decided to try a few different appetizers instead of entrees.  An added bonus was that we found out they had just started a happy hour deal that included most (excluding a few exceptions) of the appetizers at the rate of half off.  What a deal!!  I had a cup of lobster bisque which was some of the best I have ever had.  There were bits of lobster in almost every bite.   It wasn't too heavy like a lot of bisque's tend to be.  It was pretty much perfection.  We also tried to cajun shrimp boil, crab cake and lobster mac and cheese.  All dishes were quite large and very ample.  The shrimp boil was chock full of shrimp.  There was no skimping here.  All the food was very good, although I thought that the lobster mac and cheese was a tad bit bland and could have used a little more flavor.  It would definitely not stop me from trying it again, however.  \n\nService was ok; our food, which was just appetizers, took about 40 minutes which I thought was long.  Yes, it was our meal but what if it wasn't?  40 minutes for appetizers would mean a 2 hour dinner if we had entrees. I'm not sure if this is standard timing and I would tend to think not.

The food is fantastic, the prices were excellent for the quantity and quality of food, and the ambiance is nice.  Lucky for us, we arrived at 5:30.....Just in time for happy hour ($2.00 of drinks and most appetizers 1/2 off).  My husband ordered an Oyster Bloody Mary to drink.  It was seasoned perfectly and quite delicious, yeah I had a few sips and stole an oyster.  To eat, we shared the lobster macaroni and calamari appetizers, they were super.   There was so much lobster macaroni  (we ended up taking half the lobster mac home) that we didn't order an entree'.  Instead, we shared a third appetizer, the crab cake (we took 3/4's of this home too) and the lobster bisque.   There were large pieces of lobster in the bisque and it was really good. The crab cake was good and it was nice to have the micro greens as they added a nice peppery seasoning to the crab cake.  That being said, I didn't understand the fried avocado that was served with the crab cake.  We love avocados but that didn't work for us.   I would give this a 4 1/2 stars but the system won't let me.  I would have given 5 stars if service had been a bit better.  We had to ask for water three times and really didn't see our waitress much.  But when she did come around, she was super friendly.  I think the place just may be a bit understaffed as I didn't see many waitresses and happy hour appears to be an extremely busy time.  Here are a few other thoughts: on our second Oyster Bloody Mary, they forgot the oyster, olive, and lime for the drink and we didn't see our waitress for a while to rectify this before 1/2 of our drink was gone.  The lobster mac, while amazing, was just a smidge oily.  I found a small shell in the lobster bisque and our oyster in the bloody mary had a bit of sand on it.

Or worse, you can taste how old the oil? Well not the case here. Batter is made in-house and is so light, and tasty. The oil was not an after taste in our mouths.  The fresh batter and deep fried shrooms are served with an in-house made dijon/dill sauce that was a perfect accompaniment.  \n\nFish platter came, it was awesome. FRESH delicious, light and not greasy. Not one drip of oil on my plate. Served with mushy peas and coleslaw.   The french fries were decent.. not the best I've ever had.  I would have loved to see them serve fresh-cut with skins on the ends. Like fry trucks, you know? The tartar sauce was fresh, homemade and in a squeeze bottle. Perfect for peeps like me who have no shame in covering a large portion of their plate in sauces and condiments.  \n\nOverall, I will definitely be returning and trying the maple fish with lemony potatoes and other delights on the menu.

The inside of the restaurant isn't much better than the outside.  It looks like an old worn out place you might find along the ocean in California.  I ordered a 3 piece fish and chips.  It took a while to get the order and the fish/fries came out steaming hot.  It was definitely freshly cooked.  The fish pieces were not evenly cut and tasted very fresh.  Contrary to some of the other reviews, I do not think these are your standard frozen fish sticks.  Pete's fish looks much more like a standard frozen piece due to the uniform shape.  The fries were also very good.\n\nI thought the meal was very delicious.  My favorite part about this place is the sauces.  They have all the necessary sauces available and you can get as much or as little as you need.  It was refreshing to get everything and not have to beg the person behind the counter for a larger quantity of anything.  The tartar sauce tasted good and is my favorite of all the valley fish places I've tried.\n\nI've been back to this place twice since my first visit and have brought my co-workers.  They all shared similar feedback and enjoyed their meals.  On the return visits I added a piece of shrimp which was huge and delicious.  I tried the cocktail sauce with it and found that I really enjoyed their sauce.

The fish and chips there were awesome, but oh so covered in fried batter.  My coworker, having not really had much fried food in his diet as of late, got a mean talking to by his stomach.  I, on the other hand, suffered from a bout of the itis.  Mmm fried food.\n\nSo here I am on a Saturday afternoon wondering what to put in my belly.  I was driving down South Rainbow, planning on getting something quick at Fausto's, when I saw Lazy Joe's Fish & Chips nearby.  Now the only other fish and chips that I enjoy here in Vegas is at the Crown and Anchor; mostly for the fish.  The fries there are just okay.

The other two fish choices were catfish and hughglej...yeah, I don't remember.  I *think* it started with an H though.  The thing that surprised me was how the fish turned out.  It was delicious, but also didn't have that \"fresh out of the fryer\" layer of oil on the outside that seems to be typical.  All food is cooked to order, which is obvious when you try to take that first bite of fish (and then proceed to do the rapid \"inhale-exhale\" with the food still in your mouth, instead of, you know, taking the food out).  The batter on the fish did not overpower the fish, it complemented it in that you didn't feel like you were eating batter with a little fish filling.  The fish fillets were a good size, with me feeling very satisfied at the end of the meal.  The seasoned fries were great as well.  See Michael W.'s review for a more in depth look at the fries.\n\nAll in all it was a very satisfying meal.  With a bottle of water it cost me $10 and change for my meal.  After finishing my meal I noticed that they had a sign with a special for all you can eat fish and chips for $10.95 or so; better deal?  Yes, but I was already stuffed after two pieces of fish.

The owner was quite nice and advised us to get a small drink (which is still a gigantic 20oz cup) as there are free refills in the restaurant.\n\nThe various fried items (fish and zucchini) were nicely breaded with their special coating and remained moist inside. The coating was substantial and more in the style of a cornmeal-type breading rather than a lighter beer batter. The great thing was it was not greasy but yes, as a previous reviewer noted the batter did have some trouble holding together.\n\nOn the downside was their sides and sauces. The tartar sauce was too heavy on the mayo - not enough acidity to balance out the flavour. The coleslaw was kind of bland, nothing special. The fries were homestyled fries which typically lack that lovely crispiness and are prone to become soggy quickly. The hush puppies were ok.\n\nFinally a quick note or word of warning. This place doesn't really season (salt/pepper) their fried items for you. Personally, I have no problem with that 'cause that's how they roll in some of the fry shops in the UK that I've been to.

For some, cross contamination is not a large concern and fried food, in all its glory, can be experienced with a minimal price to pay later that day/night. For people like myself, too much cross contamination is out of the question and fried food is something of the past unless you make it fresh at home. Of course, I felt this way until I read about Lazy Joe's and it was all trouble from there.\n\nFirst off, do not come to Lazy Joe's thinking that you are going to get that rustic ale flavor from their fish and chips. The breading is gluten-free, so it is going to taste a little different than the pub down the street (see Crown and Anchor in Vegas!). However, that doesn't mean it isn't delicious! The breading is still a little flaky and not too heavy so that it weighs down the flavor in the seafood. Even though the breading lacks seasoning at times (I wouldn't mind them adding some salt, pepper, granulated garlic, herbs, etc to give it a little more character), when it encases something like a flowered onion or a big stick of mozzarella cheese, very few negative things can be said about this experience. I added some seasoning and BAM! Dunk those fat cheese sticks into their great marinara sauce and you have an appetizer. There is nothing but pleasure while eating their version of Chili's Awesome Blossom. My waistline may hurt a little after eating these app's, but hey, it can't hurt once in a while!\n\nOnto our entree's: Calamari and Popcorn Shrimp. Oh deliciousness. Like I said, the breading needs a little more character but wow do they know how to cook this food perfectly. The shrimp were nicely sized and tender while helped by the added crunch of the breading. The portion size was quite large and if we had stopped eating when we should have, there would still be some pieces left the next day. The calamari was perfect. Served with a marinara sauce, I almost forgot about the simple breading and the fact I had to add a little extra seasoning and some lemon to make it just right. I love that they give you the rings and actual calamari itself when they serve you. FANTASTIC.\n\nNow, onto the fries. If you like crisp, somewhat over cooked french fries than this is not your place. If you are okay with slightly limp fries but with fantastic seasoning, this is the place to go. I normally like my fries crispy, but when they put their seasoned fry seasoning on these potatoes I forgave the lack of crunch and dove in head first into the massive pile of carbohydrates in front of me. To all those who say these fries are terrible, please admit to not liking these type of fries before bashing potatoes that are actually very good and bring the meal full circle. Just a tip: GET THEM SEASONED. Otherwise, they're just predictable and you should try to keep it interesting.\n\nAll in all, this should be a solid 3.5 stars, but because Yelp refuses to apply half stars to their reviews I will push it up to 4 because the service was friendly, the restaurant was clean and well-maintained and hey, any place that makes it safe for me to eat in will beat plenty of other restaurants in my book!\n\nP.S.

This order came with 1 fish, 2 shrimp, 2 oysters, 2 scallops, 2 clams, 2 hush puppies, fries and cole slaw. I'm no fish connoisseur, so I went with the haddock because the owner said it was the best; but you can choose whatever fish floats your boat between that, cod, and catfish.\n\nBATTER: Seemed like everything was dipped in a universal batter. It was quite thick and completely unseasoned--heavy spices aren't common for fish & chips. But maybe a little sea salt? I had tartar, cocktail, ranch, and some buttermilk-y sauce which was awesome... but I still felt like my meal was missing something!\n\nSEAFOOD: The fish was cooked perfectly: most & flaky. The shrimp were cut kinda funny--couldn't even tell they were shrimps until I bit into it--a little tough if you ask me! The clams and oysters had to be my favorite part. I love that clean ocean-y taste; the seafood they use here is pretty good quality! \n\nSIDES: I upgraded to sweet potato fries for an extra $1. Totally worth it. What's not to love about the holy fried sweet potato?? Crisp on the outside, soft and sweet on the inside. I'm crazy about fried mushrooms so I went with an order of that for another $3.69. I'm not a fan. The mushrooms here are bland and quite rubbery. Not ordering those again.\n\nSERVICE: Excellent! The owner was working the register and preparing the food. She was so sweet and gave me some recommendations on what to eat. Everything is made fresh. It serves up pretty quick--within 10 minutes or so.\n\nOPTIONS: If your dining partner doesn't like seafood, they do offer other options like chicken fingers and chicken wings.

The starting round starts with 2 pieces of either cod, haddock, or catfish, six shrimp, and fries. By the time you hit the bottom of your basket, you'll be filled with a sensation of mourning, like, \"This delicious fish... these tasty shrimp... they're all gone! NOOOOOOOO! What have I done to deserve this pain and misery?\" But fear not! Just let Joe and his staff know, and within minutes, the glory of fried fish is back, and this cycle continues until you profusely sweat fish batter.\n\nExaggeration? Not by much... it's that good.\n\nIt's a tiny bit on the pricey side, but then again, you're getting fish in the desert, so it comes with the territory. I wish they would expand closer to me, but for now, anytime I find myself on the southwest side of the 215, I look for excuses to be near Lazy Joe's.\n\nStop in and give it a try.

I looked at their menu online and at first was turned off by their prices however I wanted what I wanted. I got 3 of the first mate dinners. All with cod, one with shrimp and the other with scallops the last all cod. For $12.99 you get a choice of 2 out of 5 seafood choices, fries, 2 hush puppies and some coleslaw. I didn't want my scallops deep fried and the owner who was very nice ask me if I would like them Pan Seared and I was very happy and pleased as I accepted his offer.  I also wanted to treat my kid to a fun drink so I got a $1.89 bottle of some locally made root beer. Neither one of us enjoyed the root beer... The carbonation tasted stale and it had a bad aftertaste. So our food is ready and I proceed to drive 3 minutes to my home.  I get home and the food Looks Amazing!  The fries were homemade, a little salty but good. I think if they did the double fry method they wouldnt be so dark and would taste better. The fish quality was superb tender, flaky and juicy and the crust was different but cool. The only quams about the seafood was its total lack of seasoning.  There has to be a little to help enhance the natural flavors. The cole slaw was also.flavorless, mayonaissy cabbage. They need to pick up the flavors in their cole slaw, I think a bit of dill relish and some black pepper and Bam! I didnt care for the tartar sauce, it was sweet and I prefer a more savory tartar sauce, in fact a savory sauce would have complimented the fish better.   My hushpuppies were tiny a little over cooked on the outside and little under cooked on the inside BUT THE TASTE WAS DELICIOUS. I really enjoyed them. Now remember those scallops he was going to pan sear for me, in garlic and butter no less, not SEARED at All! The sear would have been perfect to compliment the texture of the scallops. They were not very seasoned either but tender and not overcooked.  I think if they took a chance and made some better culinary executions, that this place would be packed all the time. At first I was upset at the flavorless fish than I read the reviews and saw it was gluten free. Ah haaa I said however Gluten free doesn't mean taste free. Celtic sea salt is healthy and flavorfull and good for you. I finished half my meal, my kid too and my brother ate the whole thing. The quality of the food is Amazing the execution needs a bit more love. At the end of the meal all I kept saying was how I should have ordered the Lobster Roll. For gluten free I think the quality is great and should be packed with gluten free people. There was only one couple eating there and as we were waiting a man came in to eat.

I also tried the lobster roll.\n\nThis place must live on the novelty of being \"gluten free\", because that's the only reason I can see to eat there.  For those of us who can eat gluten, the batter is anything but flavourful.  I'd describe it as bland, with a \"mealy\" texture; and certainly not the nice crispy texture you'd want if you're craving fried seafood.  I understand that those with gluten allergies will love this place on principle, but this is definitely a case where everyone else suffers.  They DO have whole belly clams, so that is a plus.  However, you have to tolerate the gross batter in which they're fried.  Talk about taking a good thing and ruining it completely!!\n\nOn the flip side, the lobster roll had way too much seasoning, especially the SALT!!  It was literally like eating a salt lick on a dried out, toasted, New England style hot dog bun.  It had lots of fillers, too.  It was stuffed with lettuce and celery; not something anyone in New England would tolerate in a lobster roll.  Of course, that didn't matter, since you couldn't even remotely taste the lobster with the entire mixture tasting like it had been prepared on a big block of salt.\n\nWhen the gentleman behind the counter asked how everything tasted, I did bring the saltiness of the lobster salad to his attention.  I asked him if he made his lobster salad for the rolls in big batches, and he said yes.  I advised that he ought to taste it, as the salt levels were extremely unbearable.  He then proceeded to tell me that another customer had commented on the salt level, and that this particular batch they \"got in\" seemed \"saltier than usual.\"  Thus, it seems that they actually don't \"make\" their lobster salad in big batches, but rather \"get it in\" in big batches.\n\nHowever, the biggest faux pas wasn't the extreme saltiness of the mixture, but rather the complete lack of any effort to \"make it right\" with me, the customer.  All I got was a gruff, \"sorry,\" and that was that.\n\nI used to live in Boston.  I know what good \"East Coast\" seafood is supposed to be like.  This is NOT it!!\n\nP.S.

We were drawn to try this place because of their grand opening promotion of BOGO entrees valid on Mon. Tue, Wed thru 10/10/12. After being seated, it took over 15 minutes for our server to come by and even offer us glasses of water. We showed her the promotional coupon and asked if we could order 4 entrees between the 3 of us, and she answered yes, we would get the 2 least expensive entrees free. We decided to go with a bread bowl of clam chowder ($9), 2 orders of the fish & chips ($18 each), crab louie entree salad ($17), and linguine with clam sauce ($17), and later on key lime and apple pies for dessert ($7 each).\n\nFor some reason they thought it would be acceptable to combine both orders of the fish & chips onto one plate, but we got jipped because there was only 1 small order's worth of fries. We decided not to make a fuss over it. There were 6 pieces of beer battered fish altogether. Unfortunately the batter was very thick and greasy yet also soggy on the bottom. After my first piece, I couldn't take it anymore and ended up peeling off almost all of the batter from subsequent pieces. The mediocre tartar sauce was too runny and lacked enough acidity to balance out the mayonnaise.\n\nAs for the salad, the crab meat contained several small shell fragments and was flavorless. Our friend thought his clam chowder was so-so, and it didn't appear creamy enough. Also, the bacon overpowered the clam flavor. The linguine was ok, but nothing memorable.\n\nDesserts were meh. Our key lime pie was dominated by whipped cream. The key lime part was more like mousse, and the flavor was far too subtle. The pie crust was quite thick and somewhat soggy. Our friend didn't even finish his apple pie, and it wasn't because he was full. \n\nAs for service, this is where it gets interesting. As soon as we received our entrees, our server asked us how the food was, when it was obvious that we hadn't even touched our food yet. We answer that we just got our food, and she replied that she would be back to check on us, which she never did until we were almost done eating our entrees. My water glass remained empty for over 10 minutes before it was refilled. At another point, she came by and put her water pitcher down on the table and asked if we were interested in dessert. We said sure. She ignored my more than half empty water glass and picked her water pitcher back up and left to get the dessert menus. When she returned with the menus about 10-15 minutes later and eventually returned to take our order after another 10-15 minutes, my water glass still was not refilled. In fact, my glass was never refilled after that first time and remained near empty. Finally, we flag her down and ask for the check. Eventually, she brings the check, but says she can't apply the promotional BOGO discount until we give her the coupon. We tell her we already gave you the coupon when we placed our order. She mumbles something while leaving me the bill and takes off. At this point, I'm not sure what is going on. Was she expecting me to give her my credit card before seeing the corrected bill? Several minutes later, she comes back and grabs the check from me with no explanation. She reprocesses the bill, but it only shows one discounted entree instead of two. When I point this out, she says that we only got 3 entrees: 2 fish & chips and a linguine with clam sauce. We tell her we also got the crab louie entree-sized salad. She mumbles something about double checking the menu. Eventually she comes back and says that the manager told her to apply the second discount. However, when she hands me the check, it is somebody else's check with their credit card! I hadn't even given her my credit card yet. She didn't realize her mistake until I pointed that out. While we await her return for the umpteenth time, we ponder whether she is on drugs or just really really stupid. After another 10 minutes or so, I am able to take care of the check and finally get out of there. Starting to notice a pattern? The time between when our server would check on us was long and it added up. We were there almost 2 hours because of the interminably slow service.\n\nTo summarize, their food is sub-par and pricey for what you get, and the abysmal service is some of the worst I've experienced in a long while.

One of the more anticipated openings this month was Seafood Shack which replaced Isla, the Mexican restaurant in TI. So we checked out there website which advertised the BOGO entree promotion. SOLD! (I can't help it, I'm Asian and I can't help a good deal). We were going the first Tuesday of the grand opening.\n\nSo we were getting a table of 3 and I was the first to arrive. I got seated around 6:15 and waited for the rest of the party to arrive. The bus girl comes by, fills the water and leaves me alone. Fine. \n\nAs my party trickles in, I still had no idea who my server was. By this time, it's around 6:50 before she decides to saunter to our table and even acknowledge our presence. Dead serious. No asking if I wanted a drink, no wondering if I wanted to order an appy or anything. Yeah. It was that bad.\n\nI was watching her like a hawk too - she literally disappeared for a significant portion of the time unlike the other servers around the restaurant. We literally saw her once to take our order, once when our entrees came (she asked us how they were when we didn't even get a chance to take a bite), once to take the dessert order (which I had to flag her down -- she mumbled under her breath \"in a minute\") and three times finally to get our bill right.\n\nYeah, you guys heard me. Three fr$%king times to get the bill right. (She lost our BOGO coupon, neglected to take off a discounted item, gave us another person's bill -- I could've taken off with another dude's credit card --- yeah... that bad). That added another 30 minutes of playtime at the Seafood Shack.I was beginning to think it should be renamed Seafood Inn because at the rate we were going, I thought we might have to sleep in our chairs. We were stranded there for 2 hours. God forbid if you actually had show or something to catch.\n\nAlready the service (or lack thereof) would be enough to detract most people. Add to the fact that the food was subpar at best made the insult even more pronounced.\n\nI ordered a crab louie salad which is not difficult to do well as long as the ingredients are good. The crab meat was severely below expectations. The crab was all macerated, and lacked the sweetness good quality meat. Added to the fact that there were bits of the clear shell and outer shell pieces mixed in, it was no es bueno. Throw in a few meally tomatoes and some rather generic thousand island dressing, you have yourself a sh*(ty experience for $16.95.\n\nWe ordered 2 orders of the fish and chips ($17.95) which were put apparently on the same plate for reasons unknown. That was annoying because we were out with a friend and he obviously didn't want to eat off of our plates. Plus, they only provided half of the serving of chips but double the fries. Not that the fries were that great to begin with but come on! The fish itself was greasy, overly battered and quite frankly nothing I would order again. Again, the tartar sauce was some generic stuff you could get at any grocery market.\n\nOur pal ordered a clam chowder (comes in a bread bowl -$8.95) and the linguine with clams ($16.95) but neither was anything special according to him.\n\nBy now, I should have known better and quit while I was ahead. However, I am a sucker for key lime pie and noticed it was on the menu. So thinking that there had to be some sort of redeeming quality about this establishment, I ordered that to share with the hubs while our pal got an apple pie a la mode ($6.95 each).\n\nOkay - let me get this straight - if your key lime pie is f%^king lime green, you know it came out of a box and that there's no freaking way there's any sort of real lime in there let alone, key limes. The oh-so soggy crust accompanied by the rather solid bright green filling from a generic Jello box was a full on textural assault and violation. Would not do this again. I noticed as well, our friend's apple pie - he left most of his pie crust on his plate and it looked like a limp doughy mass.\n\nIn general, I do not have a lot of one star reviews and I really hate writing one unless it is really really bad on all fronts. However, Seafood Shack - you've just +1'ed yourself in my 1 star club.

If you are a fan of olives, you will enjoy this bad boy.  My buddy and I did feel that the salt may have gotten away from the chef.  Over salted, but I didn't mind too much (maybe to request less salt next time).  The tuna was soft and you could taste the pepper snear.  Love the buttered bread they had on the side of the plate, but it gets soggy with the salad.  Our main course was the Clam Bake! That's right, go big or go home.. I thought it was very well made and presented.  I ordered a side of garlic fries to sweeten my meal.  Great addition.  Clams were huge and plenty of mussels.  Some sausages and corn.  The lobster was well baked in there and the sauce was just right.  Not over powering and I did not die of thirst = not much sodium! Bam!  I ended up having to ask for a togo box.. Sadly we lost.  \n\nI had some desert, the carrot cake.  I have got to say, more carrot taste and less frosting.  I don't how everyone else likes it, but I prefer less frosting on anything.  Cake came out and it looked like an ice cream sandwich.  Pretty decent sized.  \n\nOur server, very nice gentlemen.  Right out, he asked for our drink order, then came back several minutes later and asked for our app and came back later once again and asked for our main order.  Nice guy, came back with some bibs for our main entree and the table was prep with wet naps.  He came back with my refill before slurping the bottom.  He was on top of things, even my togo boxes, he made sure to double my box in case some of the sauce slipped through the first one.  \n\nEnvironment, Great looking.

The decor and atmosphere of the restaurant was something one would find in a cheesy seafood eatery on a Carnival cruise ship. My first thought was the sad bar they had at the front. When I have my seafood, I usually like to have a good quality beer with my meal. My first expectation of any expensive burger or seafood joint is a nice selection of brews on tap. Seafood Shack had only 4. No Guiness, Sam Adams, or Bass  for me. I stay away from the Budweiser, Miller, and other cheap beers.\n\nSecond, me and my brother ordered the clam chowder sourdough bread bowl. The soup had more ham flavor than clam. Personally, Progresso's clam chowder soup straight from the can tastes fresher than the soup we got. For $9, I'll stick to the clam chowder soup at Panera Bread.\n\nWe also ordered the fried calamari appetizer. For $12 dollars, I was expecting a decent platter to pass around. The portion size was quite pathetic and the batter for the calamari greasy and thin. For the same price, one can go to an Olive Garden and get 5-6 times the amount of calamari. When a pound of fresh squid can be had for under $5 at any seafood market, charging $12 for the 4-5 bite size portions we received was nothing short of a ripoff.\n\nThe main entr\u00e9e I ordered was the fish and chips with scallops and shrimp. The portion size was average with the amount of fries quite low. The amount of fries compares to a McDonalds small to medium. The fish, shrimp, and scallops were cooked well but not worth $20. For $21, I can get a large fish and chips entree, an appetizer sampler of calamari, scallops, and shrimp, a fish taco, and coleslaw at the Pacific Fish grill restaurant at my local shopping center.\n\nWith the $400 plus bill my family had, we all could have gone to the Rio's seafood buffet instead. For seafood and beer not near the beach, I'll stick to Joe's Crabshack.\n\nMax Power", "review_stars": 1, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "After reading others reviews I was regretting having bought a Groupon for this restaurant but I bought it so I might as well use it.

I should have ordered a dozen oysters and a quart of that champagne slush. We also had a white wine steamed mix of mussels and clams. This offering came hot and plentiful. Plump mussels and clams in a great broth. The garlic points that were with the bowl were not enough to dunk up all the broth. I will ask for more toast next time.\n\nMy Wife and I are confirmed \"Food Sinners\". I could care less how terrible fried food is for me. It is worth your life here in the desert to get a decent Jersey Shore fried Seafood Dinner. Well, we found a place that knows how to do it.

The plate contained big portions of thick white fish that was fried to perfection along with shrimp and scallops, all big and all very fresh. Hey, we are NOT talking   pre-frozen stuff here, we are talking boat to belly fresh. Cole slaw, fresh French fries, tartar sauce and cocktail sauce rounded the whole thing out. When we were done eating, there was no film of grease on the plate. Each piece of fried seafood had only the fresh fried taste of that variety of ocean denizen it was. There was no grease on our hands and no greasy smell either. The white wine by the glass and my very cold beer added to the pleasure of this meal.\n\nLibby had a piece of key lime pie for dessert. The pie was chiffon type, not that jello like stuff you tend to get in this area. It was tall, limey zippy, and sweet. I had to fight her for a couple tastes by the fork full.

They had to ask 4 times for the chips. Then when meals for all of us came, they brought them out two at a time. The 5th meal didn't come out for a full 15 minutes. I worked in food service and it was unacceptable to bring out partial orders. My friend sat there waiting for her meal. Server wasn't attentive (we asked for napkins several times, drinks weren't refilled). Also, as we sat on patio, a busser went to take down an umbrella from a table to fit a larger party (push the tables together). He ended up hitting a lady at another table and we were ducking and moving out of the way. A guy at another table offered to help him but he said no and kept trying to move it. It was something out if a comedy routine (turn with a large item, people ducking under). \n\nThey also seemed to have a problem with their phones for a while. Either it would be busy, or the call would disconnect after ringing a few times. They don't have a hold system as I called one time for an order and the server asked me to hold on. It was then obvious he just placed the phone down and I could hear everything going on. I stayed on the line for about 10 minutes and by then was in the area and just went in to place the order. When I walked in, the phone was still off the hook and now had the dial tone. So for at least 15 minutes no one would have been able to get through. \n\nSo in short I love this place for the food, but there needs to be a lot more attention to the service and the ultimate atmosphere.\n\nBetween myself, friends and fianc\u00e9, we've had a few of the tacos, appetizers, soup.

The man who greeted us over the counter could not have been happier if he had been a dog in a field full of squirrels. It doesn't seem an exaggeration to say that I suspect frying fish has been his lifelong passion.\n\nBecause we were so early, we got the first haddock to go into the fryer - clean, white haddock of gobsmacking, Jonah-swallowing proportions which the chap wobbled at us playfully before setting about the battering and frying.\n\nAt this point - minutes after the doors opened - the shop filled. I mean it properly filled. I know not how many of these were pilgrims like us, and how many were locals, but it's clear that the reputation of The Golden Bite's fish suppers is widely renowned. I was reaching five stars simply from the cleanliness, the rich frying smell, and the chap's jollity before I'd even put anything in my mouth, and when a small girl entered and he pulled down a teddy bear to wave at her, I was smitten with the place entirely.

Outside only. No bathroom. I just moved here from Minnesota and one of the places that popped up on my radar was this Pete's Fish and Chips in Mesa. When my mom came to visit, we spent a day checking out the sculptures and going to the Natural History Museum, then we took my daughter to Pete's. It is popular. The place was busy. There were cute signs around saying things like \"Clean up after yourself, your mother does not work here.\" My mom ordered the scallops, only to be told they'd been out of them for over a month and were looking for some more. Huh? How does one \"look\" for scallops for over a month?  I ordered the two-piece fish and chips. I have to say I was disappointed. I liked eating outside, I liked the orders being called out, I liked picking up the baskets but the actual food was not great. I was genuinely shocked that the fish were frozen square patties - crisply deep fried but frozen patties. The special sauce was unexciting - some kind of red cocktail sauce - no tartar sauce, no malt vinegar, no ketchup, no nothing. I was just very surprised. I had really wanted this to be a great place. It's got great atmosphere and is a fun hang out spot, but why can't the food be good? My daughter ate some fries and a mediocre rice krispy bar. She had fun sitting on the kiddie play things - I think there was a car or something. Bummer. I had really wanted to bond with the place, put their bumper sticker on my car and become a \"regular.\" That's not going to happen. I think Pete's is a champion at marketing. Their bumper stickers are free and their atmosphere is just like the atmosphere at those stands with really good food - like Pinks or the fish and chips place on Catalina or....anywhere.

Not cafeteria quality square patties with crumbly breading. Everything tasted really artificial. No tartar sauce available as far as I could ascertain. The \"sauce\" they give appears to be just ketchup so why not just call it that? \n\nFrench fries - as limp and unappetizing as I've ever seen. And I have a mountain of them left.

When we walked up to the window, there was an elderly Hispanic man standing next to the window, holding a dollar bill. He appeared to be disabled and had one of those carts with wheels and a seat which he used to walk. He spoke to my husband in Spanish, but he doesn't understand Spanish at all and I didn't understand him because he spoke fairly quickly. My husband ordered our food and we sat down. A young couple was sitting at the table next to us with their small child. The father got up and went to the man. He asked him how he can help. The old man replied, but I could not understand him still. The father then ordered food and paid for it. Meanwhile, a woman who had been sitting with her husband at another table got up and gave the elderly man some cash. He thanked her several times. The young father stood with the old man until his food arrived. He helped him put the food and beverage on his cart and the elderly man covered it with a bath towel. The elderly man went on thanking the young man and (I think) blessing the young child. The father hugged the old man and the family left. The other couple left shortly thereafter. At first, I thought that was such a sweet thing to have happened to this poor, crippled, elderly man and felt it was such a good thing to see people helping someone to obtain a basic necessity.\nBut then...\nThe old man walked down to the light and crossed south across Van Buren and then headed back east toward the bus stop across from Pete's. He met up with two younger men; probably in their late twenties, early thirties. He spoke to them and handed them two plates of food and the drink. (Remember, I witnessed the father buy him ONE plate of food...) They talked for a bit while the young men ate the food. The old man then gave one of them cash and he ran back across Van Buren to the Circle K. He emerged shortly with a bag in his hand and ran back over to the man. He handed the elderly man the bag from which the elderly man took out a large can of beer and started drinking it. The bus arrived and the two young men got on it and left. As of right now, the old man is still across the street drinking his beer. What is left of the food is sitting on a half-wall next to him- he hasn't touched it. \nI am writing this in hopes that at least one of two things happens: The man can no longer run this scam because people who read this will be aware of it and/or Someone will help him find resources where he can get his needs met another way besides scamming people into feeling bad for him and buying him food out of the kindness of their hearts.

Being a pesci but absolute no-no meat eater otherwise she couldn't have anything that had been fried. So had to forgo the chips and reorder a grilled piece of meat. \n\nThe fact they cook things in animal fat isn't explicitly stated anywhere obvious. I think it's a reason a lot of people rave about their food, and the chips were sooooo good. But for veggies it really would be good to have a notice at least. \n\nAnd I do agree with Catriona that the grilled fish offerings were nice but not quite the same as a fried fish supper. I went with cod, and whilst it was a very ample serving and was completely cooked, it came a little cold and not quite grilled as high as I'd like. The red pepper sauce to go with it was really nice (a side order). The salad was quite measly though.

The cake is moist, but a little dense and heavy with a large river of melting chocolate oozing out of the center.\n\nThe Sticky Toffee Pudding is a nice large piece of cake, which is a little dense covered with an overly sweet toffee sauce.  The sweetness is reduced by the scoop of ice cream (or whipped cream if you like, I believe) dolloped on top.
