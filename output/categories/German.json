An authentic feeling enviroment with a selection of foods that not only a native could love, but anyone willing to step into a Black Forest story book will find tasty.  Despite it's Central Glendale location the place wasn't heavily patronized on our Friday night visit, still we had called ahead as suggested and set a reservation time. We were seated immediately, but were forgotten for almost a half hour. I  didn't realize how long we were sitting until my partner pulled out the cell phone to check. I was looking over the decor and commenting on the trinkets and chatting.When our server came to take our order they were profusely sorry and immediately put a large bread pudding on our food list, either to take home or eat at the end of our meal, whichever we wanted as an apology. \n\nFrom that moment on there wasn't a lack of attentiveness at all. The first two things that came were a Filet Salad and a Sausage appetizer. The salad was divine! Here is the description straight from their menu: \n\"Slices of Filet Mignon, Radish Sprouts, Marinated Artichokes, Asparagus, Green Olives, Roasted Red Peppers, fresh Spring Mix, tossed in Lavender Vinaigrette, topped with quenelle of Herbed Goat Cheese....\"  That's right, drift off with me....to that lovely description. The Olives were not oily, they were fat, plump, martini olives. The Filet was perfect.  A Lavender Vinaigrette? It was a WOW. But it's a limited time salad, so it may not be there when you visit.\n\nThen came the sausage sampler. You no longer can choose the sausages you sample like the online menu states, and you get saurkraut not german fried potatoes, but it was still nice. They set a bottled mustard you can buy in any grocery store on the table.  I think it  would have been nice to have some sampling of german mustards for dipping. It was at this point that I noticed we didn't have a bread basket. I had read about Rye and Pumpernickle with a tapenade that comes at the beginning, so I inquired. Unfortunately this was a cost loser for the restaurant and they no longer do it. Instead they brought out three basic dinner rolls with the tapenade instead. This change dissapointed me as it's rare to get hearty breads and the tapenade doesn't go well on a basic dinner roll, they should just bring out some butter.\n\nOn to the dinners. It was so very hard to choose among the Schnitzles and Sausages, but we managed. One Nurn-burger Combo and a Schweizer Schnitzle later with a side of potatoe dumpling and we were quite sure we'd ordered plenty of food. The Tomato soup which prefaced our entree's was better than I expected. Neither of us like Tomato soup and both of us liked this one. I'd skip the potato dumpling side in the future it was a gooey mass of starch,  maybe we should have tried the Spaetzle instead. \n\nThe Schnitzle was really good and the sausages juicy. I think I could try a different schnitzle each visit and be pleased. I also might consider just a sausage and a bun. They will bring a roll for your sausage if you ask. The Wirsing was very tasty, I had read it wasn't so good, but I was thrilled with it. In the end we were quite full, we had ordered some drinks and had forgotten the large promised bread pudding. It arrived and we ate what we could handle while the Tuba and Accordian duo played their way through the restaurant. \n\nA bit spendy, we hit $80 for the two of us, but we weren't trying to eat cheap. Careful planning could lower the cost. All in all it was quite festive and fun for an evening and we are glad we went.

The beers are delicious, true German brews served in massive glasses. I prefer the 32oz Hefe. The beer is never a disappointment and is reasonably priced.\n\nHaus Murphy has a new menu. The number of dishes has shrunk and the prices have gone up. Not a big deal initially, I understand it's a sign of the times. However, I was shocked to see my final bill. I ordered a side of sauce for my schnitzel that amounted to five dollars. Wow. A quarter of a cup of mushroom sauce for five dollars. Next time, I will do without.\n\nAlso, our waitress asked if we would like to split the bill as couples. We accepted. However, she returned to the table and informed us that she had tallied the beers incorrectly.

I expect a piece of beef marinated for three days to not require a knife to cut and to have some flavor of it's own before dowsing it in gravy, and sauerbraten I have had before met this.  This one to me was quite chewy and the gravy too sweet.  Gravy is one of those things that just because I think it is too sweet doesn't make it bad or improperly made, it just didn't suit my taste.

The pretzel was very obviously made there - it wasn't from a box of frozen \"Super Pretzels\" like the ones at the ballpark. And it wasn't oily or covered in a bunch of melted butter either. Just wonderful! Warm, toasty on the outside and soft on the inside but not \"doughy\" either. It was the highlight of my meal, to be truthful.  The bread basket included alternating slices of rye and pumpernickel bread. I tried the rye, though I know that I don't like rye bread, so I don't know why I did that. Eh.\n\nMy friend and I shared a Bartlett Pear Black Forest Sandwich, which actually turned out to be pretty tasty. It was Black Forest ham, with julienned pieces of pear, fresh baby spinach, some mild cheddar cheese and a \"walnut spread\" that just tasted like mayonaisse.

After visiting Berlin and Franfurt for a week, I absolutely fell in love with German food. \nWhile the service was great and prices were decent, the food was not as exciting as I thought it would be. For an appetizer, we ordered the stuffed mushrooms. This was a great start to the meal because they were great. Possibly the best stuffed mushrooms I have ever had. Cream Sauce was amazing and the shredded sweet potato on top was a nice touch. That, along with my beer, were the best parts of the meal I would say. For dinner I chose the bratwurst with sour kraut and German potato salad, and my husband chose the paprika schnitzel with wersing and German fried potato's. Both of us had the soup of the day as well which was cream of mushroom. The soup was decent although it could have used a bit more salt. My meal was ok but comparing this to similar meals in Germany, I felt it was kinda boring and lacking. Also, the curry ketchup I ordered was not what I expected. Curry Ketchup in Germany is a lot like BBQ sauce in taste. The stuff I got at Haus Murphy's just didn't taste right to me. It tasted like ketchup with a curry aftertaste. Anyways, my husband did not like his paprika schnitzel at all. The flavor also seemed a bit odd. If you don't like curry, do not order this dish! The fried potato's were mediocre (kinda boring). The wursing, on the other hand, was very good. I think its because it had the same cream sauce as what was in the mushrooms. After dinner, we decided on bread pudding for dessert. This dessert definitely needed some work. There was not enough spice in it so it tasty like nothing more than bread soaked in eggs most of the time eating it. In any event, Haus Murphy's wasn't bad. I am rating it based on whether I would continue to go there and since I am in Maricopa and its in Glendale, the food would have to be spectacular to make me want to come back.

That same friend told me to try the Wiener schnitzel as it is the representative item when you think of German cuisine. So all our schnitzel's came out and mine was the blandest.

Our food order was taken promptly after that and soup appeared a few minutes later, as expected.

When we commented/questioned the long wait, we received no apology from the waitress, but were told they were busy.  This long-standing Glendale restaurant is always busy so that reason seemed pretty lame.  Six of our dinners were then served.. The dinner ordered \"without bacon\" was served 15 minutes later, when everyone else was at least half done eating.  One of the dinners served came out with a kitchen substitution as they had run out of spaetzle.  Isn't that like a Chinese kitchen running out of rice?!  Ironic that according to the menu, substitutions are not allowed by the customer at Haus Murphy so you'd think they wouldn't automatically substitute either, but instead inform the customer when they are out of an item and let them choose what to do. The person ordering the dinner did so because spatzle is his favorite and therefore accepted goulache to get the spaetzle.  His preference is smoked pork chop - no spaetzle allowed for that entr\u00e9e however.\n\nTo be fair, two of our party really enjoyed their dinners (schnitzel and spicy brats), but the other four did not.

For my entree I ordered the Wiener Schitzel, I had not had baby cow in a long time, it was well worth it.  I ate only have of it and took home the rest.  It came with potatoes and wirsing.   The potatoes were very good, on the other hand, I personally didn't like the wirsing (a creamy cabbage concoction).  Good thing Amy liked it, lol. We ordered dessert, but they were taking so long that we asked to have our Black Forest cake and Cherry Strudel to go.  When I got home, I was trying to be so good and got only a third of the strudel, then gave my hubby a third and put the rest in the fridge.

This place surely caters to the elderly patrons that live in the area. The chairs are wobbly and the vinyl of the booths if fading and cracked. The lights are from the 60, or 70's at best, but I'm not sure if that's just because the place is old, or because it's some sort of German theme. \n\nThe menu is a little pricier than expected: about $15 - $20 for most entr\u00e9es. We asked the waitress to recommend something. She spouted off about 10 things, but everything was in German and we still had no idea what to order. When she came back for our order we just pointed at our dishes and hoped for the best. \n\nI ordered the Weinerschnizel, which I don't think I've ever had. It wasn't at all what I expected. I was thinking it was some type of sausage / bratwurst type dish. The dish came with what they called fries, but they were basically baked potato chips, but they were quite good. The weinerschnizel was pretty good too. I ordered the veal version, as opposed to the pork. \n\nMy brother ordered a sausage dish which was fantastic. 3 large sausages, pork, beef, and veal. We weren't sure which one was which, but I'm pretty sure I really liked the pork and beef sausages, but the veal one was a little dry. \n\nMy sister-in-law ordered a walnut crusted chicken dish. She is prenant so she ended up drenching it with lemon juice to bring out the flavor so by the time I tried it, it was a little hard to swallow. \n\nMy wife ordered a great beef dish that was very, very moist. It came with the same delicious 'fries' that came with my dish, as well as a red cabbage Sauerkraut which was decent, but had a minor beet flavor to it. It came with crisp onions and was fantastic.\n\nOverall we enjoyed the food, but it was a little pricey and I'm not sure we will make it back soon, but it was worth a shot.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I come from a very long line of amazing German cooks. \nBavarian is the only place I have found that holds a candle to moms cooking.

They are next door to each other, although I had never heard of Zur-Kate before.  What a stroke of luck.\n\nThe atmosphere was very cozy with lots of German flair.  The place was very crowded at 8pm, and everyone seemed to be having a very god time.  The first thing we noticed about the menu was the far lower prices than the ones on menus we had seen on line for other Valley German restaurants.  Many different kinds of wurst, schitzel and chops are available to choose from.  Each entree comes with a choice of German potato salad, spatzel, potato cake, home fries or french fries.  You also receive your choice of sauerkraut or red cabbage.  A salad bar is included, and basket of rye bread delivered to the table.  There is not an entree on the menu over $12, and you can add a wurst to any entree for $2.50.  Beers are in the $2-$4 range - where does that happen?  These prices are already amazing, but then you see the portion sizes.  The schnitzels are huge, and each comes with a generous portion of side.  I had the Rhein Schitzel - juicy pork, lightly breaded and fried until golden bown and crisp, topped with sauteed onions and a sour-cream based light gravy.  It was fantastic.  Very well seasoned, light, not greasy and absolutley huge.  Add in the red cabbage and spatezel and you have a formidable meal.  I added a knockwurst just to try it, and there was no way that I could finish my dinner.  Everyone at my table felt the same about their meals.  This place is a gem and should not be missed.

After bringing out our drinks, we were also given complimentary rye bread, which had a decent flavor but would've been nicer if it was much warmer.  I ordered Sauerbraten for $11.50, sliced beef covered in a mild brown gravy with a surprisingly very pleasant sour undertone with hints of tomato.  The spaetzle was straightforward, simply prepared tiny noodles with an unfortunately bland taste and texture reminiscent of risotto.  This was definitely skippable and unfortunately the only reason this is not a 5-star.  My other side was sauerkraut, which paired perfectly with the Sauerbraten and gravy to bring the sour taste more to the fore, while still accenting the savoriness of the beef and saltiness of the gravy.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered the Cordon Bleu Schnitzel for $11.50, which was a thinly breaded and pounded pork chop, covered with ham, swiss cheese, and a light creamy sauce binding everything together.  The breading gave a crunchy, pleasant mouthfeel, the meat was satisfyingly succulent, and the ham, swiss, and sauce gave it a richer feel.  Truly divine!  I took a nibble of the red cabbage an stir-fried potatoes, which were mixed with bacon, that I found very enjoyable but nothing to write home about.  The Jager Schnitzel that my girlfriend's best friend ordered, was Schnitzel covered in a mushroom gravy, and was reported to be delicious as well.\n\nFinally, for deserts we ordered apple strudel and Schwarzwalde Kirschtorte, both setting us back $3.50.  This was an outstanding conclusion to our meal, with the apple strudel containing tart apples hidden within, with soft, buttery layers of perfectly cooked dough generously topped with a vanilla sauce with plenty of powdered sugar.  The Schwarzwalde Kirschtorte, Black Forest Cherry chocolate cake, was also immensely satisfying, with the ice-cold cherries being a perfect counterpoint to the dense chocolate and frosting.\n\nStuffed, impressed, drunk on flavors and revelry, the final personal touch was the owner insisting we take some cookies she made from a plate left out at a bar.

Not terrible, but definitely not up to par with some of the other items on the menu.  The spaetzle was a bit bland but the red cabbage was very tangy and a nice balance to the heavy gravy of the rest of the plate.\n\nMy dinging partner had the Schnitzel Cordon Bleu ($11.50) with the potato dumpling and red cabbage.  The potato dumpling was pretty much exactly what you would expect; somewhere between mashed potatoes and a dumpling.  Interesting, but a little plain.

We are eager to go back to try more varieties of the schnitzel!\n\nWe rounded off the meal by splitting a slice of the Black Forest Cake.  It was a wonderful way to finish.

I wanted to give it a middle of the road 3, but according to Yelp's rating guide a 3 is \"A-OK\" and this place isn't that good.  The schnitzels are all prepared the exact same way except for the different gravies or toppings.  Sur Kate makes its schnitzels by pounding a piece of pork flat. Breeding it and then frying it in oil.  This is basically what a schnitzel is but schnitzels should all flavored be flavored slightly differently (not just in the gravy but the breeding and cooking method as well).  Without the gravies the schnitzels at Sur Kate are plain bland and soulless.  Comparing these to what a real homemade/flavorful German schnitzel should taste like is like comparing a fried hamburger patty to a BBQ marinated filet mignon.  The sides are passable - not great - not bad not even just plain good.  All in all the food is just OK, but then again the food at BK or Wendy's is also OK but a lot cheaper and quicker.\n\nI could put up with less than stellar food if the service was great or good but the service is even more disappointing than the food.  Once you walk through the door there is no real indication as where to wait to be seated.  So you just stand there.  It takes forever for anyone to acknowledge that you are there and then even longer for someone to seat you.  Even then they do not seem that trilled that you are there.

The wait staff jam as many parties to a table as they can then spend as little time interacting with the guests as possible.  None of the waitresess seemed to know the menu or what made German food German.  I had to flag someone down to get a drink refilled but actually the glass was removed but the refill did not come until I was trying to pay (which required me tracking my waitress down to get the bill. She wasn't busy working but talking.)\nThe decor was down home German and fun.

The regulars all seemed to know each other and the staff.  They all seemed to be having a wonderful time.  \n\nNow it may not seem like it but I had fun here.  We sang and danced a little.

Our German friends came with us and said it was straight out of a 1960's little German town. We were seated promptly and service was pretty good. There were about 6 or so tables and just one woman serving so we waited a little bit but not bad. \n\nThey had quite a few gluten free options which was nice. Their gravies are not made with flour, and a few of their entrees are g-free. The food was okay, I was really hoping to be more impressed. Our German friends thought the red cabbage was pretty good but were not big fans of their schnitzel or their sausage. The sausages were gluten free so I ordered the Knackwurst and my boyfriend had the Currywurst, we liked both of them. He didn't like the schnitzel he ordered (I couldn't have it since it had bread crumbs) and my cornish game hen had been fried and was really really dry inside.

It scurried around for about 10 mins until he finally got it. By this point I had excused myself to the bathroom... we all paid our checks quickly and left trying not to make a scene. \n\nSo, while I wasn't super impressed with the food before this happened I still probably would have come back for the sausages but after what happened I'm a little concerned about the cleanliness so I have to recommend a no go to yelp viewers.", "review_stars": 1, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 4, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I wanted to like this place.

So that's what I ended up getting. The verdict -- it was good but my mother's (and mine) is way better. It tasted a little over cooked and could've used more of the traditional ingredients stuffed in it. I also ordered sauerkraut and potato dumpling. The sauerkraut was a little bland but stll good. The potato dumpling was my favorite item on my plate. Nice big dumpling ball, perfect consistancy with the traditional crouton in the center.  \nI must add that we sat down and ordered our food around 6:30 - 7:00pm and I almost didn't get the rouladen. It was the last one they had.  So people must love it.\n\nThe rest of our table ordered either one of the schnitzel or brat plates.

Saturday night here is sort of like... the real owner went out of town, left his college-age son in charge, and he used the space to throw a party.

Actually, I never really noticed this place at all.  There were a lot of hipster types and people with great personal style.  It was very hard to differentiate between the gay guys and the straight guys.  Usually, the straight guys don't know how to dress so it's easy to tell them apart, no offense straight guys.  Can you tell that I really enjoy it when people express themselves through their clothes?  Plus, it made for a fun game with my two gay companions.  There was a cute guy at the end of the bar and I just couldn't figure out who he'd be into more.  I decided to go find out, but as I approached him I notice he had one of those rings in his nose like a bull would have.  Maybe this is wrong, but that freaked me out and my internal voice screamed abort, abort!  It's sad how something so trivial can be a deal breaker.  I'm just not into anything that hangs out with snot.    \n\nAnyway, the place is split into sections with a bar on one side and a dance floor on the other.  The bar is against one wall and there is a flat screen streaming live video of the dance floor.  The bartenders were really great, and might I add partially naked.  I like a little eye candy with my vodka.  It was also pretty cheap compared to what I'm used to paying for Kettle One.  It was about $6 instead of $10.  It was a weird combination of neighborhood bar meets Scottsdale dance club.  \n\nI spent most of the night in the bar, but did find myself dancing to a few songs.  While surrounded by gyrating green laser beams, I spotted Mr. Nose Ring and decided that he would probably not be into me based on the way he was dancing.

I'm going to give four stars for gem\u00fctlichkeit (coziness), since I had a great time hanging out in the bar listening to accordion music coming from a table full of regulars. The bartender was also personable and conversational, so I stuck around after my first beer in order to quaff a second and order some grub off of the bar menu.\n\nI was intrigued by the bratwurst sliders. I'm pretty tuned in to what decent bratwurst should taste like, since I lived in Germany for nearly three years. I'm partial to the Th\u00fcringer style, which is what I came across growing up in West Berlin, but everyone in the Phoenix area appears to favor the N\u00fcrnburger variety. The N\u00fcrnburger style is perfectly acceptable to me however, as I had eaten a delicious one on the street at the Mesa Christkindlmarkt (Christmas market) just a few days earlier.\n\nLet me offer my comments about where Black Forest Mill got it wrong. The bratwurst sliders were served with sauerkraut which was just too darn sour. I glanced at some fellow bar diners who left their sauerkraut nearly untouched. They really need to cut back on the brininess (rinse it better before preparing or add some apples to balance it out). I don't think this is an \"American palette\" issue... it really is nearly inedible. Now the bratwurst \"slider\" is a novel idea I applaud. But they were served on sweet dinner rolls which were soft (almost like Hawaiian bread). Not only did they get soggy sitting in some sauerkraut juice drifting over from the other side of the plate, but it was the wrong flavor and texture counterpoint to the sausage. A sturdier more rustic European-type br\u00f6tchen is what I was hoping for. And the bratwurst themselves were unremarkable. Tasted boiled... should've been grilled. The mustard that came with them was the standard American substitute for German mustard, Gulden's spicy brown mustard, which isn't bad. However, I had just shopped next door at the German Sausage Company (presumably the same owners?) and noticed they had authentic sharp German L\u00f6wensenf. I think it would've been a real treat if this restaurant could've offered some of that on the side instead.\n\nSo, call me picky if you must. But I think I know German food and, although I loved the atmosphere and the beer, I think the Black Forest Mill could step it up a bit on the food preparation. I will post an update if I return and try something here that hits the mark. The waiter kept talking up the schnitzel sampler, and the gulasch and sp\u00e4tzle sound awfully tempting.

Too bad for him, The Man says they can't serve it anymore. \n\nBlack Forest Mill is a German bar, in case you didn't catch the hint from the giant German Sausage Company sign on the attached store, the servers in the most ridiculous German dirndl that does not cover nay their bust nay their bottom (possibly a plus for some), and the exclusive selection of German beers.  Happy hour lasts until 7 - $3.50 German beers. I was not thrilled by any of the beers, but I'd consider the Dunkle the best of the bunch. I did not care for the Hef.  The bar food was nothing special (I did not try their full menu items). The pretzel was tasty but the beer cheese was no better than melted Kraft cheddar, edible but very uninspiring. Fries are typical, the sausage platter was actually pretty good and probably the best thing to order if you are looking for some more traditional fare. The service isn't particularly good - our bills got mixed up, it took forever to get our fries, and you could sit at the bar with an empty glass for far too much time. \n\nThe best part of BFM was definitely the music. Where else can you see a cute old man name Bill, play fun Polka music on the accordion and keyboard? He's a real one man band and the highlight of my night. He plays the evening show, ending before 10pm. On Friday and Saturday  they have music all night. The Friday night band is great, and play soulful music/motown and covers (note: not very German).

I can imagine many people just coming for the drinks while listening to the music during the lively evenings.  I had the Rheinischer Sauerbraten which is a prime sirloin marinated in wine and vinegar for 10 days.  The tenderness of the sirloin was great and you could certainly tell that they've marinated it for a considerable amount of time.
