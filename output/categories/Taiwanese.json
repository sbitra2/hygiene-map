Doesn't taste exactly like the one from Ay-Chung, other Taiwanese eateries in LA, or the food stands on the streets of Taipei.\n\nOne criticism I have is the lack of dipping sauces. Pot Tea only has 2: Sacha & Ponzu. Come on.....it's a hot pot place. You need more than 2 dipping sauces! Also, please provide chopped green onions and cilantro, too! On the other hand, they must be commended for offering minced pork over rice as one of your carb choices with no extra charge. Nice touch.\n\nThe one thing that is a FIVE is the service.

It's in a nice location on Rainbow, right by Oyshi. We came in and were greeted immediately by the hostess. There was only one other table of guests in the restaurant, so they weren't very busy at all. Understandable since they're brand new. We were told their grand opening will be in May, so hopefully business will pick up for them. \n\nLet's get to the food. We ordered the sweet potato fries, popcorn chicken, and chicken wings to start with. Sweet potato fries were okay, not my favorite. The popcorn chicken and chicken wings were pretty amazing. Both were crispy and very flavorful, especially with the sweet chili sauce that it came with. For our hot pot, we ordered the rib eye, which was delicious. There were three of us there and it was enough for all of us. The cool part is that when you run out of broth, they'll refill your pot with fresh broth. And the pot is heated up the whole time it's at your table so it doesn't get cold. For dessert, we tried the cheesecake and the salted caramel ice cream. Both were pretty tasty separately, but together, they were amazing.\n\nAs far as service goes, the staff was great and attentive the entire time we were there. The owner, Wendy, was kind enough to stop by at our table and ask for our input on what we ate. We had a nice chat about their food and she was very sweet and recommended that we try the stinky tofu next time. Our server, Ariana, was awesome and friendly. The other servers that helped were also great. I'm looking forward to many more visits to this place!\n\nAlso... bring cash! The one and only downside was they were only taking cash at the time, which was understandable. We had cash, so it wasn't a huge inconvenience at the time.

We ordered chicken wings and the Japanese Miso hot pot. It took at least 30 minutes for the order to come out and only after following up with one of the servers who later turned out to be the manager. All the wait staff were very nice and did apologize for the delay. The food came out shortly after and the chicken wings were okay but we were so hungry by then anything would have tasted good. The hotpot came out after and the serving looked good for the price. \n\nOur dining experience made a turn for the worse when I found a piece of wire in our soup and I brought it to Ariana, the server's attention. She apologized and told us that she would be right back. After waiting another 10-15 minutes, she came back and said the manager will take care of us but didn't really elaborate. At that point, we had waited almost an hour and only had chicken wings. Another server asked us if we were okay and we told her that another server was helping us. We waited another 10 minutes and finally followed up with Ariana again who then told us that the person who came over was actually the manager Kara and she would take care of our bill. I told her that we didn't even know that she was the manager since she didn't introduce herself, just thought she was another server.\n\nI understand that the place is new and maybe they are not used to handling this type of situation.

I honestly think this place got high ratings because this is the best hot pot we have in Vegas.. which isn't saying much. So overall taste wise, Pot Tea gets a solid 3 stars which is a little harsh, but since I am Chinese, I do have high expectations for hot pot.  \n\nCame a couple of days after their opening and they were still doing some minor construction work. No biggie. I got the spicy beef hot pot and friend got the spicy miso pot. I asked for super super extra spicy while the friend got the mild. My hot pot turned out to not be spicy at all.. while my friend's actually had a good kick to it. The hot pot came with a side of minced pork rice (or vermicelli or white rice). I loved how they filled the pot with lots of ingredients, beef, fish cake, corn, imitation crab etc so they definitely weren't lacking in ingredients. What they were lacking in was flavor of the broth. The broth was really really light.. barely any flavor. And sure you can dip the stuff in the sauces they provided you with on the side, but they only provided you with 2. No option for you to make your own so that's kind of a bummer. We also ordered a side of popcorn chicken which wasn't that good either.. I thought the popcorn chicken at Easy Life was better. \n\nSo overall, if you're not familiar with Chinese hot pot, then give this place a try. If you've grown up eating hot pot all your life, best to save the $12 and eat hot pot at home.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 3, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "I don't know if it's because I have a toddler who just got potty trained but the name did give me a few giggles.  This restaurant though is quite serious about it's casual but modern design and it's awesome food.  You enter into a large space that is bright, casual yet tasteful, a mixture of rustic wooden tables and benches with more industrial chairs.  Coupled with very warm and attentive service, this place is perfect for families and dates. Personally I am not a huge fan of shabu-shabu or hot pots, but this place has definitely converted me into a wanna-repeat customer.  (Thanks for bringing me here wifey!)\n\nFrom 11am-2pm, you get free green or black tea with your lunch which you can have sweetened or unsweetened.  We had the Taiwanese popcorn chicken and my hubby, son and I LUVED it.  Popcorn chicken can be so boring and hard and chewy but these have a delicate crunch and light but savory seasoning and it comes with basil leaves.  Mmmmmm.  I ordered 2 plates and didn't get to take any home.  My friend ordered the chicken wings and I didn't feel like trying them coz it looked dry and they didn't care for it too much either, said there wasn't much flavor in the chicken itself so you can skip this.  \n\nFor the bowls, hubby had the Rib Eye and I had the Kimchi bowl.  Let's start off with my Kimchi bowl, when it was served in their adorable containers over a live fire, even with the mild spice level that broth was EXTREMELY spicy.  It was more manageable when I had the fire under my bowl put off but man, was I sweatin!  The broth was very tasty and I enjoyed the mix of meat, vegetables, seafood and pseudo-seafood elements in my bowl.  I had beef, shrimp, scallop, squid, mussel, clams... the works.  Add a few more meat toppings and 2 people can share this bowl with an extra cup of rice.  I definitely enjoyed both the filling and broth of my bowl much more than my husband's order, which I thought was quiet bland.  \n\nHowever, they have this wonderful condiment pronounced \"sha tsa\" sauce which reminds me of a marriage between chili paste and bagoong (shrimp paste).  My friend said it's called Chinese barbecue sauce made with dried scallops.  It is very addicting and you can bump up the flavor of your hotpot to your liking.  \n\nIf you are into hotpots, sharing and clearing up a stuffy nose, definitely stop by this Pot Tea.  Teehee.

Social house? I'm not sure.\n\nYou're going to experience your own \"hot pot.\" If you've done hot pot before, you'd be sharing one giant one with everyone. Not here. You're generally in around $12 for your own hot pot. This includes a side (rice, rice with pork, or noodles). You can also pick how spicy you want it.  You'll be served a wooden sort of stove with a chemical fire keeping your pot of choice boiling. There are a few problems with this.\n\n- These things take up a lot of your table in combination with your drink, a small extra bowl, and your small side.\n- The above is an issue because... it's still boiling in the pot/wok! It's way too hot to just eat straight up so you need to use your extra small bowl. So when you move soup and ingredients into the small bowl it's hard to maneuver yourself far enough from the fire and pot and close enough to the tiny bowl safely.\n- Because it's boiling hot and nobody had room to move food around to smaller bowls, everyone was blowing on their food. A lot. I, personally, got light headed. I have never worked so hard for my veggies.\n- Because everything already comes boiling in the pot, things are going to be cooked at paces that will likely displease you. Some things are already overcooked. Some will just not cook at all. It's not at your own pace.\n\nIt's genuinely questionable to me if it's worth $12 for what you get and how much work you have to do. I think I just prefer a regular hot pot experience where you can cook things at your own pace, in your own way, and likely much cheaper per person. Maybe that's just my bias. Maybe you'll go and you'll find a personal bowl is better. I just didn't. I know I've just never seen food consumed so slowly.\n\nOther items tried...\n\n- Taiwanese fried chicken. Extremely heavy breading on bits of fatty chicken. Extremely, extremely salty.\n- Sweet potato fries. Soggy, floppy fries.\n\nAll that aside, quality of ingredients is fine. The place is clean.

I'm not well-versed in this cuisine but after my dining companion mentioned the lack of dipping sauces (they only offer two) it definitely felt lacking.

Opting for the vermicelli noodles over rice helped retain all the flavor from the broth. \n\nDespite the spiciness level being right on, nothing else about our meal was particularly memorable.

It took over the New Day Caf\u00e9, so it was interesting to see what they did with this casual breakfast joint.  I was pleasantly surprised with how they changed the look and feel of the place.\n\nThe menu is very detailed, which makes it easy for those new to the hot pot world.  You know what you're getting upfront, so no random things in your soup show up.\n\nThe Husband and I chose to share one pot:\n\n#9 Sour Pickled Mustard & Lamb Pot \"Sliced Lamb, Sour Pickled Mustard, Daikon, Tofu, Carrot, Fish Ball, Fish Fillet, Lotus Root, Cuttlefish Ball\" ($11.99) with the waiter-recommended Minced Pork Rice (other choices are Steamed Rice or Vermicelli).  When the hot pot arrived, it looked great!  However, as we dove further in, we noticed not too much pickled mustard in the soup.  What's the point of calling it Sour Pickled Mustard & Lamb Pot if there's not much of the main ingredient present?  The server came by to shut off the fire and didn't really hear me when I suggested lowering it instead.  (Or perhaps lowering it wasn't an option?)  As a result, our soup got cold quickly.  Therefore, you don't really want to drink the broth when you're done.  The accompanying Minced Pork Rice was a really small portion and it would cost $2 more for another bowl.  We chose the medium spice level, and it wasn't too spicy.  \n\nWe also ordered the Taiwanese Pork Hocks Stew ($5.99).  Biggest mistake ever.  They were the driest and toughest ham hocks I have ever had.  The term 'stew' is misleading because it's not tender at all! I could barely pull any edible bits off and I needed some major flossing when I was done attempting to extract some meat off those things.\n\nAnother appetizer we tried was their Fried Stinky Tofu ($5.99).  Average, not really stinky or memorable.  I should mention Sweet Potato Fries ($5.99) were also on the menu - totally random in my opinion.  And I looked around, and not many people finished their order of it.\n\nOverall, Pot Tea Social House was an okay food experience.

It was funny to watch the look on the faces of each of my dining companions as they raised the wiggly sliced ears to their mouths. These were more of a texture food than a taste food. The ear skin was super tender while the center cartilage was on the crunchy side. Challenge won.\n\nLess challenging was the scrumptious Beef Roll ($3.95).

The portion size was huge and dwarfs any I've seen elsewhere.\n\nA favorite was the House Style Chicken with Fresh Basil ($6.50). This dish was made from pieces of bone-in chicken, then covered with fresh basil. It was plate licking good.\n\nPork Belly with Sour Vegetable ($6.50) sounded good, but the sourness of the vegetables was off-putting.

It took us all awhile to order since we didn't know where to start.  After getting our orders in, we were able to get a deck of cards so we can be part of the crowd.  The BF and I shared a large Mango Snow Ice ($6.25) with no tapioca.  Good stuff, mostly because it tasted like mango puree.  Our other friends order the Chrysanthemum tea, which came with two tea cups, a medium Lychee Snow Ice with tapioca ($4.75), and a Iced Black Tea.  When ordering the black tea, the waiter asked if he wanted it hot or cold, and he opted for cold.  He didn't expect it to be sweetened though.  It ended up being okay in the end, but took him by surprise when he tasted the sweetness.\n\nTo grub on, we ordered Fried Spicy Chicken ($4.50) which is deep fried with basil.  The BF and I like to grub on this from various boba places that offer it.  We also tried the Fried Tofu ($4.50), which is pretty basic and comes with hot sauce.  But decent when you want fried junk.  We tried ordering the Taiwanese Pork Pacman ($6.50), but the waiter strongly discouraged us from ordering it.  We ended up with the Fried Squid Balls ($4.50), which is exactly what it is, squid balls!  (Not those kind of balls, duh!)  Food is pretty pricey when you look it over, but you're really here for their beverages.  They also serve random things like Chicken Alfredo Pasta ($7.50) and Squid Jerky ($4.50). \n\nThe cool thing about this place is that you can chill and hang out.  You can grab a deck of cards and just have a good time.  (Apparently we were having too much fun though 'cuz they told us to quiet down.)  You'll find people of all ethnic backgrounds here as well, which I always think is a cool thing.\n\nService is just okay.  They never cleared our table, so we had to put the plates on the shelf next to us.  We were there for a good couple of hours too and ordered throughout our stay, so that's probably why they allowed our loud selves to stick around.  \n\nOverall, I do like places that allow you to hang out and play cards.

A good selection of snacks... and the Tea Station provides an ample selection of snacks to outright meals. And an ambiance that is not aimed at the teen-age crowd - the decor will tell you when you walk into Tea Station that you don't have to be a teen-ager to frequent this establishment.

The crowd is getting a little older also... the age of the crowd on a weekday at 11pm seemed to be more in their late 30s than the predominantly teen-age, college-age crowd back when I lived in Las Vegas.

At some point we were a bit worn out and jaded at this pseudo imported A$N pop concert experience and how lame it turned out to be (where half of the songs had no live band backing, and one song was lip sync'd to the studio album playing in the background, sorry Coco ain't Janet Jackson who in her prime sang AND danced) and immediately thought about where we could unwind from the madness (or lack thereof).\n\nSo Tea Planet came into play. We knew about this place as TP (not toilet paper) is actually Tsing Shong Xiao Dzan, aka Tea Station Cafe. It is also owned by the same group or family who operates a chain of them across Southern California (and two locations in Nor Cal, Fremont and Newark) with them mainly stationed by the location by San Gabriel Square on Valley.

My iced mixed fruit tea was overly sweetened (was my favorite drink at the Southern Cal TS). I suppose this location is better than the one in Nor Cal Newark, decent and passable and for sure way better than Quickbux or some other tapioca tea joint.

Remember to ask for extra sweet butter!  :D  \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS / TIPS:  Stay away from the Chicken Curry - it's definitely subpar (at least the one time I tried it here) - it's overcooked, looks (and tastes) like TV dinner food (or leftovers) - gross.  ALSO, come during lunch instead because their lunch specials include a reduced-priced milk-tea drink of your choice.   \n\nDETAILS - DETAILS - DETAILS:\n-----------------------------------------------\nAtmosphere:\nEven with just one dining area, there's hardly ever a wait.

If you have a party of 5 or more, don't count on eating at the same time, because they serve you the food as it comes out for your table.  And there always seems to be the one lagging entr\u00e9e, appetizer, drink or dish that prevents me from having a completely satisfying meal.  The servers are sometimes \"shy\" and neglect to say \"hello\" or \"thank you.\"\n\nFood Quality / Selection:\nThe food here is just average.  Depending on what you order, you may get \"above average!\"  LOL  The portions are generous enough for the \"Asian\" diet, but may not be enough for others, so consider ordering appetizers as well - perhaps the Sweet Butter Toast and Fried Tofu.   If you order their Dumplings, be prepared to have it be the last entr\u00e9e served up because of the time it takes to steam them.   \n\nPricing/Value/Convenience:\nOverall, I would say that this restaurant has a good value for simple, fast, authentic Chinese food in Las Vegas.   I find myself coming back every time I come to Vegas because of the value.  It's well priced and the food is comparable.

Sometimes it was so difficult to chew that my friends and I would use them as ammunition in our parking lot wars. Maybe I should not be complaining because we got a drink and entertainment for the night. My second issue is how expensive they are. Compared to all the other tea shops around, they are by far the most expensive. \n\nI like that they do not use too much syrup to mask their teas, but that can backfire when the tea has been sitting around for too long and become bitter. It has happened on a few occasions, but overall their green and black tea are strong and not watered down. \n\nThe taro slush is my drink of choice and of course one of the more high in calorie drinks. It is rich, creamy and everything bad for you.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 3, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I enjoy Boba Tea from time to time and this establishment is open late and has a convenient location on Spring Mountain that's fairly close to my workplace.\n\nThe inside is gleaming, very modern-esque with tables and booths on the floor, tea and sets availble.

The syrup teas are all very sugary and sweet so if it's your first time, I recommend an almond tea with a few boba so you can try it.   I would try around at different tea houses on Spring Mountain because one or two of them actually made them with fresh ingrediants and not artificial syrups.  \n\nThey also have tea flavored snacks and hot treats such as the soups and takoyaki (WOOOO TAKOYAKI!).  Beware, takoyaki is HOT in the center even if the exterior seems cool.  The fried Tofu is also nom nom nom, but remember: this place is meant for snacks and comfort food.

If you come with a group, they do expect most of your group to buy something. I also believe there is a $10 credit card minimum (before tip), so if you don't plan on spending that much be sure to bring cash. This place is also fairly overpriced for both food and drinks.

I even experimented different ways to order drinks (Pointing to the drinks on the drink counter, speaking slowly and enunciating each word, learning Taiwanese (Okay, maybe not the last one but I might as well have)) to lower the aggravation or pissy meter off of these wait staff members. Nothing works. They will often get annoyed or angry that you can't get your order right the first time. I have worked front of the house in cafes before larger than this establishment and I have not once showed signs the level of discontent or disrespect these guys show. It's gotten from me being embarrassed thinking I made a mistake to being embarrassed that they don't know how to do customer service. Probably the only constructive criticism I can say is to retrain these two wait members or get a touch screen so you can punch in your own orders to save time, money, and customers. \n\nBut enough of the bad, the good is that their drinks are consistently good and there are some very good helpful members of their team like the older pudgy guy who usually mixes the drinks or the young short girl who always seem happy to have a job.\n\nI would give this place one star if it wasn't for the consistency of their food and drinks.

When I'm feeling iced tea, I get Iced King's tea: not so sweet, not so strongly herbal, there's a nice medium. My boyfriend likes chrysanthemum tea, which is strangely calming. I like their shaved ice, but their new addition which I think is called 'Iced Coconut Combo shaved ice' is absolutely AMAZING. It's shaved ice with boba, taro balls, rice balls(mochi like), grass jelly, azuki beans and sweet potato balls. Me and my friend weren't feeling the sweet potato balls so we switched it out with aloe vera. And oooo0o0o0o0o SWEET JESUS THAT WAS GOOD. Also, their menus have been revamped and everything looks much cleaner! Definitely coming back for that combo shaved ice again ahem. \n\nAnd now the cons. It's expensive as hell. Well not really but you're paying 4-5 dollars for a regular sized drink usually. However I would say it's worth it since out of all the times I've gone there the past three years I've only been disappointed once(don't get the hibiscus tea that drink felt like a good sour punch to the face). Another con would be service. The service is a hit or miss. They can neglect you sometimes. As a server, that's probably one of the worst things you can do. But it doesn't happen every time, it's honestly just a hit or miss. \n\nAs for the card limit, yes it is pretty high. There could be a number of reasons why it's so high because it's a hassle to process cards, higher running profit, and so forth. It can be a pain sometimes but I don't think it's that bad if you're with a/some friend(s). Just make one person pay and pay them back later with dinner or a family sized bag of chips or something. \n\nBut yeah, tea station's quality of drinks and shaved ice is good.
