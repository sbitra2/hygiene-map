In one night I had a fusion of Asian, French and American Cuisines. Chef Don and his staff presented the courses personally to me and I felt very comfortable.  The dishes were like devoring artwork they included Caprese Salad with house made mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes, basil sorbet with a balsamic maple reduction,  Hudson Valley Foie Gras pan seared on coconut banana bread toast and the Buffalo short ribs braised in Fat tire beer with parmesan rissotto cakes was amazing. Service was impecable they greeted myself and my guests with complimentary Champagne and I discovered a delicious wine with the Konrad Late Harvest Riesling 2002 from Malborough New Zealand from the Maitre D Robert ..When I left  the staff gave me  a rose I guess its my memory of the finest meal I've had in a while .", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 4, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Sigh...

We (including my wife and 10 year old son) had the best dining experience we have ever had. We all chose the 10 course meal and it was unbelievable. The chef defines true fine dining. If you want a menu full of variety go to chain restaurant. The chef spent all day making from scratch all ten cources. The result was breath taking. The chef presented all cources and had perfect wine matching. The downfall to this restaurant was that few people understand fine dining. You do not order like you are at dominoes like Flora W. must have thought in the previous review. I asked the chef about that review and he had no idea. He just told me he gave out many promotional gift cards for dinner when he opened to get new business. I have heard the restaurant has closed. I was planning to return to Vegas next month and would have never missed the opportunity to go back. It is unfortunate that Henderson did not embrace this restaurant.

We love good AUTHENTIC Asian food, so their \"Favorite Chinese\" dish section did not appeal to us. Orange chicken is not Chinese food, seriously. The Burmese/Thai section of the menu, however, really interested us. We chose 4 items from this section of the menu. When we ordered, we were informed that 2 of the items we had ordered were not available as they were out of both kinds of rice noodle. We substituted for the tom ka soup and a papaya salad. We also had pad Thai with shrimp (for the kids) and a Burmese chicken curry. \n\nThe soup came out first and I knew immediately that it didn't have coconut milk. I mentioned it to the server when he asked how the soup was. He said, \"Yeah, I know, our chef is new.\" Uhhhhm okay, then why serve it that way? The soup tasted unfinished and lacked many of the flavors (i.e. lemon grass) I'm used to in a good tom ka gai. \n\nThe pad Thai came out next. It was admittedly pretty darn good. The curry followed, but it took awhile for us to get to it, as the rice didn't accompany it. I asked about the papaya salad about 10 minutes after the other dishes had been served, but the server seemed annoyed and told me it was coming. The curry was on the yummy side. If you like white meat, this isn't for you. I can take an occasional foray into the dark side, so I liked it. \n\nWhen the long anticipated papaya salad came it was missing a few of its promised ingredients. I was unfamiliar with green papaya, so I had expected something a little sweet. A green papaya tastes a bit like zucchini. The tomato was on the pink side, never an excuse for that. If tomatoes are pink, they shouldn't be served. I was already full by the time this starter dish arrived. \n\nWater refills were promised, but not delivered until the end. The place was nearly empty on a Friday night. The server took 10 percent off for serving sub par soup. The proprietors should ask themselves why. Let me tell you why. \n\n1. Your server was a bit distracted. One customer was even getting his own drinks. I know he's your son, which makes it an easy fix! \n\n2. You weren't able to provide simple menu items and ingredients that could be purchased at Fry's. Seriously, you don't have to go to Lee Lee Market for rice vermicelli. \n\n3.

I really enjoyed the plum sauce as opposed to the omnipresent orange sauce.\n\nThey have a couple of kinks to work out. But the place was comfortable and inviting with a self serve soda machine. They have a lot of different entrees from all over Asia; This includes asian po'boy sandwiches. They are a couple of bucks more than the chinese restaurant we normally go to but it's a nice change of pace. It's always good to have options.

You can watch them preparing the food before your eyes and can see all the ingredients lined up. \n\nLuckily, there's a menu above the ordering counter that is visible from almost anywhere in the store. As we waited in line, my order slowly changed from beef and broccoli (with rice) to Mongolian beef (with noodles) to Kung Pao with shrimp. (Due to my husband's subtle and clever persuasions.) I saw Vietnamese Iced Coffee on the menu and was sold. It was quick and easy to place our order and we didn't have to wait long. We ordered it to go, but when it was ready it wasn't packaged to go. An employee was quick to package it up and made light conversation with me. He expressed how much he really enjoys the iced coffee and I agreed - it was really good. I asked if they made it fresh every day and he confirmed that they did. He also pointed to the canisters of coffee that were lined up and talked about the brand a bit. \n\nOverall, the customer service was great and I loved my iced coffee. The Kung Pao Shrimp wasn't my favorite, but it could have been because that wasn't what I wanted originally. The portion was rather large - definitely can make two meals out of it.

But, who cares so long as the food tastes good, right? -- I've gone to Wok Box a few times now. For anyone expecting the Chinese/Viet/Japanese/etc. named dishes to taste like the stuff you get in China/Vietnam/Japan/etc. or even taste like what you could get in an American big-city China-town, etc., then you will be hugely disappointed. Not even remote. ***BUT*** if you walk in and DON'T have that expectation, then, as grub goes, it tastes just fine, especially for the price. Compared to the crap you would get for the same price at other joints, the food here is downright great.\n\nB. Everything else, the cleanliness, the service, the interior, the quality of the ingredients.... are SUPER!

I guess I was suprised to find that KJ\"s curry bowl had a variety of foods that did not scream \"curry\".   I came at 3 pm, so I'm not sure if I got a lunch menu or a dinner menu. The curry was on the back page which is surprising.  Then, there was an array of other ethnic cuisines---too many to be cohesive.   There is gumbo, burritos, quesadillas, chicken curries, stirfries, teriyaki bowls, etc.   Needless to say it was a real variety.  \n\n We started with a chicken satay with peanut sauce.  Then, my mom ordered a cheese quesadilla and I ordered chicken curry (medium).    \n\nThe satay:\n  pros--- had a great thai peanut sauce (although i would like a bit more sweetness to balance out the soy sauce flavor--maybe a tad bit of honey or brown sugar?)  \n  cons---oh wow. the chicken was awful.  its thigh meat, that has a weird aftertaste. I would suggest a marinade for the meat if they are going to cook it like that---something odd that left a bad taste in my mouth kept me from eating more than one piece.  We left the other meat to rest and ate the salad (hungrily) with the sauce.\n\nThe quesadilla:  well how can you screw this up? they did a good job of making a yummy four cheese quesadilla and i appreciated the queso dipping sauce. \n\nThe Chicken Curry: \npros--- the sauce is fantastic! I wish KJ's would highlight these types of things instead of having such an immense menu.....in fact, i would suggest a satay with the sauce they used for the curry! Yumm.  The flavors of the curry really were something to be coming for.  Also loved that they gave a brown rice and white rice option. \ncons--unfortunately the chicken was the problem again. Still the odd thigh meat that doesnt taste quite right (although admittedly tasted better drowning in the gravy).  I would say that if they would use a better cut of meat and threw in some vegggies (maybe mushrooms? bellpeppers or cauliflower), it would taste more varied and look much more appetizing.   The $10 price tag on the chicken curry was WAY too much for the small portion I had. I would suggest a tag of $6.99 at most.  \n\nFor a treat, the chef sent us some yummy mango ice cream! that was nice!\n\nI guess what I think is important and one of the most important things is that a restaurant needs to have a cohesive menu and have an identity.  KJ's leaves you wanting to know who they are appealing to.  I would suggest this restaurant do what they do best! SRILANKAN cuisine.  Not louisiana gumbo or burritos.  No where in Madison is there a place you can get AUTHENTIC sri lankan food. \n\nThey would be better suited to have less to choose from on their menu, better quality ingredients, better prep (marinating chicken satay for example can help with thigh meat), get rid of four of the five cuisine types listed, and some little tweaks to make presentation more restaurant appealing.  \n\nFive main dishes that are winners would be all that would keep me coming back. Trust in the quality of good meat and some good curry!\n\nWe would love to have another curry joint to go to and places like Sa bai thong can show you how good curry can appeal to many! don't need to sell out to too many people to get a following.

This is an authentic Sri Lankan, Sinahlese restaurant, and the young couple owning-operating it have much to learn about American-Midwestern mainstream culture.  First, they obfuscate the fact that they are Sri Lankan, dishing up not just very authentic, but also very tasty Sri Lankan curry (my aunt Kamala makes authentic Sri Lankan curry, but it's not actually that good).  And yet, there is nothing on the menu, on the storefront, anywhere here that would tell a potential customer that this is a Sri Lankan place.  I've tried explaining to the owners that there is a subset of Americans who are looking for different, unique, exotic, foreign and authentic, there's a market for culinary adventure.  They think they need to hide their background, so they don't scare off potential customers.  Staggers the imagination, this is Madison Wisconsin. They play this canned smooth jazz that would be too cruel to use on prisoners of war, because it's called \"restaurant music.\"  Last time I was in there I brought in some traditional Sinhalese music for them to play, and a White family at a nearby table was enthusiastically encouraging them to play it, to no avail.  They have all this peculiar stuff on the menu, burritos, some pseudo Chinese stuff, because they want to entice the teenagers from the nearby school to come after classes.  Sweet Lord Shiva, they think American teenagers are a good thing to have in a restaurant.  Well forget all that, the sincerity of the owner-couple is part of the charm of this place.  They may not know a lot about American culture, but they sure have bought into the American dream.  Once you meet them, you'll want them to succeed too. \n     The weekday menu is limited, in terms of authentic Sri Lankan, but the green bean, chicken, and dal curries are delicious.  Unless you know what you're doing, do not ask for it Sri Lankan hot, but if you want authentic Sri Lankan hot, they will bring it on.  I am actually salivating as I type this.  This place is so good, not once, not twice, but three times, I've hopped on the bus to Madison during the week, from Milwaukee, just to eat lunch.  The prices are low, the food is unique, only order from the curry section, and order one more entree than you have people, bring some food containers (they will pack the leftovers in Styrofoam otherwise, environmentally unsound, and not smart as these are gravy dishes), and bring some food home.  That's what I do.  Weekends they add some special Sri Lankan dish that's not usually on the menu, look for lamprais (not an eel, it's a rice dish in a leaf), hoppers (it's not like anything you've eaten before, don't listen to anyone comparing them to crepes or pancakes), and get yourself on their email list.  This is the best Sri Lankan restaurant outside of New York City or Toronto in North America.  I know this for a fact, as I've been to them all.  \n    Note: The interesting chairs are actually too low to be comfortable.  Go for the standard chairs or booths instead.  Also note, Sinhalese food should be eaten with the right hand.  It tastes better that way.  If encouraged, the owner-waitress can show you how.  \n     Outside of a handful of Indian-Americans (they like this \"ethnic\" food which is similar to but not the same as what they get at home), some South Asian scholars, and a few of the overeducated suburban types within walking distance, this place is still largely undiscovered.  You totally get bragging rights if you come here with the sort of friends who will be impressed when you say, \"I found an authentic Sinhalese restaurant!\"  Greet them with a hearty \"Ayubowan,\"  when you come in, and tell them Rohan sent you.

Interior design that really nice really modern (reminded me little bit of Yonaka) look not just plain walls and feel like in more upscale restaurant. The menu is pretty straight forward with your standard sushi rolls, nigiri, sides/appetizers. The star of the show for me was the jumping rice section. Maybe jumping for the spicy level not that all of them are spicy. Each one comes with your selection of protein for the Indonesia Jumping Rice had choice of chicken, shrimp, or think beef was the third option. I opted for the chicken. I wanted too try more of the menu since it was my first time went with Calamari Tempura. \n\nThe Calamari Tempura was awesome. The thing stood out most is the calamari was not  ring cuts of squid but nice whole piece not thin either. So the inside was nothing but calamari bliss. You had the tempura batter that was so on point. It was flaky, nice even coating all around, and most of all not greasy. On the inside nice thicker cut of calamari cooked perfect, lightly seasoned, and moist. Dipping sauce brought it all together. Great first course.\n\nI had the Indonesia Jumping Rice. Forgot too mention not only protein get choice of rice from white, jasmine, or brown rice. Jumping Rice & Rolls does have some healthy options on the menu. The rice I was surprise at the portion size.  I thought was good size. You added the protein again nice size portion talk about full lunch. Yay!  \n\nNo doubt plan on coming back trying more of the Jumping Rice section. Kim Chee fried rice is my favorite kind and few more fried rices that want too try.

There's also a huge bar that greets you and FOURTEEN flat screen tv's all over the place. It's totally set up for some good eating, drinking, and sport gatherings.\n\nThe CAFE SUA DA (Vietnamese iced coffee) was perfect. I am a coffee lover, and I'm extra critical. But they nailed the coffee here. Strong and sweet.\n\nAppetizers: the GARLIC AND SERRANO PEPPER WINGS are good. Comes out hot, crispy, and moist on the inside. The serrano pepper definitely gives it a kick. And the side of pickled radish adds a nice touch too. The SHAKEN BEEF SALAD comes out on a huge bed of lettuce and tomatoes. The beef is sweet, salty, and savory at the same time. The beef could be more tender, but flavor wise, it was exellent. We also asked for a side of lemon, salt and pepper to dip the meat which really enhanced everything.\n\nEntree: the STEAK AND EGG is where some of the asian fusion comes out. It's not the traditional t-bone steak you might expect. It's actually more like the shaken beef appetizer.  But the flavor is more sweet. This beef actually is more tender though. And the fried egg, which was over easy, was actually over easy!! *clap clap. The SLOW BRAISED PORK BELLY IN YOUNG COCONUT JUICE was a little on the smaller side for an entree. Also, the flavor was not as intense as I would have anticipated. It needed more bang, more salt. The OX TAIL PHO came with two big pieces of tender ox tail. It was so tasty and actually fell off the bone. Curiously, the pho tasted like Pho So 1. Which is also a restaurant in chinatown that does very well for itself.\n\nOverall, this place has the potential to be great. I can imagine coming here to watch the game and grabbing a few drinks after work. The staff is young and friendly. And occasionally, the chef comes out to see how everyone is doing. That's so cool.

Highly recommend.\n\nEntrees were Mi Sate, Oxtail Pho, and Steak & Eggs.\n\nMi Sate was OK. We all agreed it was our least favorite dish. Very super thick, peanut flavored sauce-like broth with skinny egg noodles. There is a small spicy kick, but I couldn't get over the peanut butter thickness. Maybe it just had a bad night?\n\nThe real hero of the night was the Oxtail Pho. Leave it to District One to bring this one all the way home. Very aromatic, tender (and plentiful servings of) oxtail, a truly original tasting broth. Steak & Eggs was a good decision too.

The shaken beef was nothing too special, tasted like Maggi seasoning on beef that you would get at other Vietnamese restaurants.  The appetizers were a little underwhelming besides the lemongrass beef skewers which were tasty.  We tried the pork belly buns and the tamarind wings, but I would probably pass on them next time.  The tamarind wings were watery tasting on the inside and not really that flavorful.  The old cravin cajun had better wings...  The pork belly buns were just okay.

Needed a flavorful relish or something else.\n\nSpring rolls: crunchy and the garnish (perilla leaf, lettuce, mint) was amazingly fresh and abundant. (I hate it when they only give you one perilla leaf or mint).

Nearly no meat!  I guess I wouldn't have complained if they were some bomb-diggety wings...but...they were bland.  Oh, just bland.  There was a bit of sweetness to them but that was it.  One note.  No mixing of flavors, no sour, no heat, no crunch, no nothing.  I don't think they were properly seasoned as well because I didn't get much of a salty flavor either.  So plain.  This app definitely left the wifey and I hungry and hoping the main dish would fit the bill.\n\nWe both stayed basic and got the Pho Bo Vien, the beef pho.  It came to the table steaming hot, nice.  But again....what's with the portion?  The bowl was smaller than what we were used to at other Vietnamese places around town.  And for $8 each, we were a bit surprised.  At other decent places around town, for the same price I can get the special pho with more goodies, and in a bigger bowl.  We got our little plate of veggies as well for sharing.  This included some basil, bean sprouts, and fresh chilies.  The pho was pretty good, District One has some great broth.  Not overly salty, lots of complex flavor, good on the palette.  But boy did I crave for more noodles and more beef to sop this broth up.  \n\nThe service for us was excellent.  Server was very attentive, wasn't hesitant to let us know if we had any questions on the menu to just ask.    Water was kept filled.\n\nOverall it was an OK first visit to District One.

When my correct soup arrived the noodles were flavorful and tasty and consisted of shrimp, quail eggs, sliced pork, chives and yummy broth.  The pork belly arrived secondly and it was tasty over the steam rice. Lastly the garlic noodles were totally a miss - horribly greasy and overpriced at $13.95! The waiter apologized for the poor service and offered me complimentary coconut ice cream dessert which took some time to receive since he never advised the waitress who only showed up once after bringing the wrong soup so she had to confirm the complimentary ice cream with the mangager!\n\nI don't know if I'll return here again or if they're busy....I would avoid this place.

And oysters to share with my friend. He had ordered for himself the cube chopped beef with I believe garlic noodles and an egg on top. Also an appetizer of fried chicken. With that two Vietnamese coffees. And for desert, coconut ice cream. I think that's their only desert for now.\n\nLobster pho- the broth was good, but not great. I felt like it lacked flavor. The lobster was good too, I liked how they pick out the tail and claws for you. The noodles taste like any other pho noodle, it was not too soggy. However, that was it. It was just a boring bowl of lobster pho. Nothing wow.\n\nSpring rolls- I enjoyed the crunch they added in the Spring roll.  But I wish there were more meat and noodles, the greens took up more then half of what was inside. The sauce was ok. My daughter normally loves Spring rolls but this one she only ate half.\n\nBeef w/ garlice noodles- noodles and beef were plain, barely much flavor. I felt so bad for my friend that ordered this, since he was from east coast and I wanted to take him to a restaurant that he would love. This dish didnt do it. \n\nOysters- yummy! I really enjoyed this and the sauces and flavors they added to the oysters. Would definitely order this again. Pretty small ones though.\n\nCoconut ice cream inside fresh real coconuts. AMAZING. Never had anything like this before! coconuts ice cream with I think green jello on the bottom! very creamy yumminess on top and nuts sprinkled as well.

Honestly I don't care if I am eating at a bus stop out of a paper hat if the food is good I will eat there every day.  This is literally the reason I hate trying new places.  When I arrived for a late lunch around 2pm the place was pretty busy. I later put two and two together and figured the only people drinking a bottle of Veuve on a Monday afternoon would be the owner and his friends.  \n\nI ordered the rib eye pho, I may not be an expert but I have had pho at more than 20 places in Las Vegas and LA including staples like Pho Kim Long.  The pho at District One tasted like they took beef jerky from Wal-Mart and soaked it in hot water then threw in some \"Fresh vegetables\" also from Wal-Mart with maybe a dash of MSG but certainly not enough to add any flavor.  It was the worst Pho I have ever had. Period. I am writing this review absolutely starving because I took two bites and realized that even the entire bottle of cheap Hoisen sauce couldn't improve the flavor.\n\nWhen I told the server it wasn't good and I just wanted a box and the check (In hindsight I don't even know why i would bother taking it to go.) She didn't include any utensils or sauces so she must have imagined I would just throw it out. She did give a half hearted apology and offer something different however I was so disgusted with the food so far I couldn't picture anything else on the menu edible.\n\nHere is the worst part of the entire experience, I believe the level of ineptitude transcends anything thing the \"chef\" could ruin in the back of the house. So I have already voiced my frustration with how awful the food is and I am actually offering to pay for it as opposed to just walking out and telling them where to stick it. I put my debit card in the $8 check and she promptly returns to inform me there is a $15 minimum on CC transactions. REALLY? Do I have cash? No... I don't have cash.\n\nI will go ahead and lay out the reasons why this pisses me off so much.\n\n1. $15 dollar minimum! Seriously?  This is illegal according to the Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Bill\n\n(3) LIMITATION ON RESTRICTIONS ON SETTING TRANSACTION MINIMUMS OR MAXIMUMS.  (A) IN GENERAL.--A payment card network shall not, directly or through any agent, processor, or licensed member of the network, by contract, requirement, condition, penalty, or otherwise, inhibit the ability (i) of any person to set a minimum dollar value for the acceptance by that person of credit cards, to the extent that (I) such minimum dollar value does not differentiate between issuers or between payment card networks; and (II) such minimum dollar value does not exceed $10.00\n\n2. This is stupid, what do you think their average transaction for lunch is? I'm going to go ahead and say their average check is just under $15. You are only going to piss people off with these kinds of restrictions. This may have flown 15 years ago but when the lady selling tamales out of her van started accepting credit cards on her iPhone it made this place look ridiculous.\nWhen McDonald's started allowing credit card payments, they found that the average purchase size increased from $4.50 to $7.00 (source: NPR). A broad study across multiple industries conducted by Dunn & Bradstreet found that purchase sizes were 12% to 18% more when paid for with credit card.\n\n3. I am obviously already having a bad experience, why not just proactively handle the problem and when you drop off my check let me know \"for next time\"?  Would it really have been that hard for her do think autonomously without me needing to get more upset than I already was?\n\nIn conclusion: Don't go here. It isn't worth the hassle or frustration, maybe the owner should put down his noontime Champaign and get in the kitchen.

It had one egg on top, but it definitely needed more as after mixing it up into the rice, it sort've disappeared so perhaps consider getting a extra egg if you're a egg slut like me.\n\nWe also got the fried cornish hen with tomato rice. I rarely ever see cornish hen on menus, which is unfortunate as it's a more juicy,personal sized chicken. The fry on the bird was good, light crisp and it had a pleasant seasoning on it where I detected a hint of cinnamon that was lovely.

In fact, Tivoli might be one of the larger development failures in recent years in Las Vegas. I found nothing good at Bottles & Burgers which recently closed, and I don't think anyone in town could tell you the name of another restaurant there. Now we welcome Poppy Den, the latest restaurant to open in this cursed shopping area. This place is brought to us by Chef Angelo Sosa from Top Chef D.C. and Top Chef All Stars which really means nothing to me as I don't watch any of those. Still, with those credentials it promised maybe something good. Right?\n\nAfter waiting over 20 minutes for our table to be ready even with a reservation, we were seated directly next to the bathrooms which made for a high traffic, slightly annoying location. The booths are incredibly awkward; they fit 3 people comfortably, but for a party of 4 they're forced to place a chair outside of it in the circulation area. The space is also incredibly loud as there are no soft surfaces anywhere, so if you're there on a Friday or Saturday night for dinner, be prepared to shout. There's a bar at the front that seats maybe 10 people, those crappy booths along the left side, and a bunch of loose tables filling the rest of the space. There's some sort of upstairs area that wasn't opened yet at the time of my visit, not sure what it'll be and I didn't ask.\n\nThe Poppy Burger that I came for is based on his Bibimbap Burger which was voted the Greatest Burger in America by Eater in 2011 you can read more about it here. I was hoping that the burger which was based on something with such an acclaimed title would represent a little more. The four of us ordered almost identical burgers, but what came out were four distinctly different burgers. First of all, look at the insane amount of lettuce that was placed in my girlfriend's burger, I have no idea why any chef thought this looked ok enough to send out. Two of our burgers were ordered medium rare and two of them medium, yet none of them looked similar to each other and my unevenly cooked medium-rare burger was cooked a bit more than that in spots. This was a great way to test the restaurant's consistency, which in this case was a total failure. Also, if you clicked on that link above to see the original burger this is based on, this one looks nothing like it.\n\nAs for my burger, the meat to bun ratio was completely off as there was way too much bun. The bun was grilled and actually very tasty with great sesame flavor, but was way too big and fell apart. The meat had ok flavor, but nothing great. It was charred well on the outside but that char didn't really have standout flavor. The pickles had really good flavor, but the egg and sriracha weren't that noticeable. This was incredibly messy, and the plate they give you is completely flat and makes for a very risky meal. Napkins had to be put in place as a dam to stop juices and sauce from spreading onto the table and eventually us. Overall this burger was a total failure in general, and ten-fold if you know what it's based on or compare it to other Asian themed burgers I often speak highly about. After about three bites I actually spoke out a simple \"nope\" in a response to no one's question at the table. \n\nThe fries looked and tasted almost like McDonald's upon first bite. They didn't have great flavor, but were cooked ok. The salts and whatever seasonings on it were present but not all that noticeable. The kimcheese sauce was gritty, flavorless and not really that great either, and I longed for ketchup most of the time. If you do like this kimcheese sauce when it comes out, eat it quickly because as it cools it becomes really gritty and nasty.\n\nBetween the less than stellar appetizers, and absolute failure of a burger, I can't say I'll make my way back here to try anything else. I love Asian food, and the menu certainly has plenty of great sounding items that would normally bring me back, but not in this case. The burger with fries is $13, which would possibly be acceptable if this was good. Our meal for four with a couple drinks, two appetizers and four burgers came to $120, which is way too much for how unhappy I was walking out. While the restaurant was very full the night we were there, I fully chalk that up to the fact that it's a brand new 'hot' place, and don't expect the lack of draw that Tivoli has to bring anyone to it, just like the rest of the places there. If Chef Sosa truly wants to make a great Asian themed burger, he should go down the street to Bachi and take notes on the proper size of a bun, how to form a patty, and how to apply your toppings. Until then, don't bother coming here.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 5, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "The Skinny: unbalanced flavors and seasonings, miniscule portion sizes mar Angelo Sosa's new restaurant (2) service: attentive but with some missteps (3) value: given the so-so to mediocre offerings and the exorbitant pricing, this place is a big fail (2).\n\nWe ventured off for Poppy Den with a friend of ours on their opening day for lunch. Suffice to say, this joint lives up to its inauspicious name (Poppy Den? Who in their right mind would name an Asian inspired restaurant this? After what the British did to turn generations of Chinese into opium addicted zombies? WTF?)\n\nAnyhow, colonialist aspirations aside, we were seated promptly and shown to our table. We ordered the Market salad with soy/truffle dressing ($7), Aunt Carmine's Fish Fritters ($11), Amma's Homemade Tomato Soup ($7), Poppy Burger (with fries, $11), Grandma's style Roast Chicken ($15), Steak and Potatoes ($18). We also sampled two desserts - the Chocolate Molten Cake and the Strawberry Sake shortcake.\n\nThe Market Salad ($7) can only be summed up in 1 word = weird. There was a little too much basil which pretty much overwhelmed the other subtle flavours of the mixed greens. The boiled egg thrown on top really didn't make any sense - such a heavy item has no place amongst delicate leaves. Added to the fact the heavy addition of a really unbalanced dressing (overly tart and salty), this was a massive fail.\n\nAmma's Homemade Tomato Soup ($7) didn't arrive as hot as I had hoped. Serving it in such a shallow bowl made it cool off rapidly which didn't help. The soup overall was too sweet for my tastes. It was kind of like diluted ketchup with some curry flavor mixed in.\n\nAunt Carmine's Fish Fritters ($11) was perhaps the highlight of the meal. Nice and crispy on the outside, the fish mixture married well with the aioli it was served with. Unfortunately, the cost of the dish was rather high considering the small number of fritters served.\n\nThe Poppy Burger ($11) flavor was good but there are some major issues with the dish. Because we were sharing amongst three people, the hubs cut the burger into 4 equal serving sizes. But what is this? When he cut the burger into quarters - one quarter had no burger meat in it. I repeat - no burger meat in it. That meant that the burger:bun ratio is about 3:4. That's a sucky ratio because when you bite into a burger, you want to get a taste of everything... not just the bun. \n\nThe fries were the thinner variety with a small sprinkle of togarashi on top. They were okay but nothing special. The kimcheese was alright  (we asked for on the side because we didn't want the sauce to mar the crispiness of the fries) but nothing that I would say I'd specifically yearn for again - it was more of an aioli than a cheese sauce per se.\n\nGrandma's Style Roasted Chicken ($15)... it's a f$&king insult to a person's intelligence to put such a dish under their supposedly \"large plate\". This is not a large by any means. Really, the portion size for the chicken is about 1/4 of a boneless thigh off a regular sized chicken. I am not s&*tting you - it is that small. Served with some pickled vegetable, I fail to see how anyone except an 6 month infant would consider this a meal. The actual preparation of the roasted chicken was okay and edible but given the price it ought to be much more than this.\n\nSteak and potatoes ($18) was only ok. Texturally a little tough, we were very underwhelmed by this offering. Served with a bland au jus and togarashi seasoned potatoes, it was definitely forgettable.\n\nFinally dessert - we tried both the strawberry sake shortcake and the molten chocolate cake. The strawberry sake shortcake was overwhelmed by the oversaturation of the sponge with large amounts of sake. Not good. The chocolate molten cake was very good - nice and gooey on the inside but again for the price, small.\n\nOverall, I wanted to love this place but there are too many flaws with the dishes to warrant a return visit. Even if this place were half the price and double the serving size, you just wouldn't come back to a restaurant that fails on so many levels of flavor and textures.

I want to give them the benefit of the doubt given its only been 19 days since opening...the staff was running around, giving food to tables that didn't order the food...our food was either waaaay too salty or under seasoned...it was comical almost.

I've been a big fan of Angelo Sosa since his days on Top Chef, and I was excited when I heard he opened this place. I suspect most of the negative reviews on here come from the difficult challenges of opening and running a new restaurant and breaking it in right. This place (at the time of this review) is only a few weeks old, give 'em a break! \n\nI came here on a busy night, without reservations. Our hostess was very professional and accommodating. She took us back right away to a table, even though the place was packed. She even offered different seating if we didn't like where we were at. I was happy being near the kitchen, trying to sneak peeks behind the scenes so I declined, but I was pleased that she offered. \n\nOur food selections:\nI think they are still tweaking the menu, I noticed items that weren't listed online and the menu was clipped together. That's okay with me, I like being a test subject when it comes to food  :)\n- Cucumber Kimchi starters : The portion ample, I think this was the first time I had kimchi with a fork. I didn't mind, but I felt awkward without chopsticks. I didn't ask if they had any, but they might considering the menu is heavily Asian inspired. I digress, it was pretty spicy and tasty, but I was craving some sort of crunch as I always do, so I didn't go crazy on the kimchi. \n- Amma's Homemade Tomato Soup : OMG BeSt ToMaTo SeWp EvArR! That's what i felt like while I was eating it. This soup was creamy and so delicious. Had a nice kick to it as well that made me sit up straight with joy. Though I admit, I was dying for a grilled cheese or croutons to go along with it. \n- Korean BBQ Short Rib : This wasn't bad, it was seasoned well and cooked just right. Just didn't wow me like the rest of my meal.\n- Crispy Pork Belly : You MUST order this when coming here. Seriously. Crisped to perfection, I just about fell over after tasting this. You can't find pork belly like this anywhere else in town, I've had my fair share in the past.  \n\nCocktails from the evening:\n- Honey and Hazelnut : (JACK DANIELS HONEY, SNAP, COCONUT, NUTELLA) This was so-so(sa). Barely tasted the ingredients past the whiskey, especially the Nutella which I was excited to see in this drink.\n- Naked Lunch : (KAI LYCHEE VODKA, APEROL, LIME, SAKE, COLA) Light and refreshing, liked the lychee flavor on this one. \n- Poppy Sling : (PUSSERS RUM, CHERRY HEERING, POMEGRANATE, PINEAPPLE) My favorite of the night, it wasn't too sweet as I was afraid it would be, and it almost had a background spiciness to it that I loved. \n- Piece of my Heart : (MACCHU PISCO, PINEAPPLE, THAI BASIL, LEMON) my 2nd favorite! Very well balanced, great for the pineapple lover who doesn't want to be overwhelmed with the sweetness of it. \n\nI also noticed someone commented about their water, it tasted fine to me, and I can always tell when there is something off or unpleasant about water. \n\nAmbiance and Upstairs:\nI think I would best describe it as modern rustic. I thought it was pulled off very well, it made dinner fun looking at all the nice little details, like their cute plate ware. There is also a patio area that'll be great to enjoy eating when the weather is nice enough for it. The upstairs has a lounge area with a bar that has Anime playing on their flat screens, a DJ, good amount of comfortable seating, and gorgeous views. I noticed a private dining area upstairs I think, but nobody was in there at the time. There's also a large outside area upstairs with seating and space to fill a lot of people, again with awesome views. I could see this place becoming very popular and trendy soon, especially when the better weather shows up.\n\nService:\nBest I've had in probably my entire life. Everyone we interacted with here made us feel like VIPs which is what you want to feel anywhere you go, even if you are paying what everyone else is. Our server Kristy is a pro, she clearly has been doing this for a long while (though looks very young) and knows what she's doing. She charmed our table so well, we didn't care if she was BSing or not at any point which any person working for tips might do, so job well done. She even hooked us up with a meet and greet with Chef Sosa in the kitchen! I was thrilled he was there during my visit, as I know he was other places and projects around the world. Being the nerd I am, I was totally nervous and probably looked/sounded like an idiot. But he was very gracious and humble, taking the time to chat with us even though it was busy. And yes, he is even more ridiculously better-looking in person. I miiiight post the picture though my nervousness came through a bit too much haha.

But everything we had was pretty good.\n\nI started my morning with a Honey and Hazelnut martini, it reminded me of egg nog but sweeter, I was quite pleased with my drink.\nFresh croissants to begin our brunch were good but appeared over cooked/burnt, the honey, jam and butter accompanying  them helped moisten them up. \nI was able to get another drink while we waited for food so I tried a Poppy Sling which was a good sweet drink also that I'd get again.\nMy husband and I decided to share the Crab Toast with Mango, General  Wings, and  Pork Dumplings. So the Crab toast was different with the sweet, acidic mango...I liked it but not awesome. The Generals Wings we both really liked...the sauce was sweet and sticky but could've been spicier. The wings were huge and perfectly fried crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. My husband liked the pork dumplings more than I did, I felt like they were over cooked. The filling was okay but nothing special. I was able to sample another diners fries with Kim-cheese dipping sauce, I wish we would've ordered some, they were tasty.\nWe all shared and sampled a trio of  their Ice  cream with Potato Chips...they sealed their 4 stars in there! Miso Toffee was my favorite, the Strawberry was good but just like strawberry ice cream anywhere, and The Lemon Poppy seed ice cream came in second for me.\n\nAll of the staff was very friendly and attentive from start to finish.

Ol' Wolfy started a Vegas revolution when he opened Spago back in '92 and other celebrity chefs followed. Sosa is one of the first TV celeb chefs to open a spot in the Vegas 'burbs and hopefully more will follow (it's great to hear Bradley Ogden has plans to open a new restaurant in Tivoli soon, also). Comparing Sosa's culinary chops to Puck's might be a stretch right now, but his food is tasty.\n\nHere's what I've tried:\n\nJarred tuna ($12) - unique presentation in a square glass dish; tuna was decent quality, well seasoned with a little heat.\n\nWatermelon and goat cheese ($8) - nice presentation, flavors worked well together, really loved the candied wasabi that added a nice crunchy texture.\n\nPork pot stickers ($9) - order of 5 sitting in a shallow bowl with a sweet, thick sauce\n\nTuna deviled eggs ($12) - eggs are cut up in pieces, next to a mound of tuna tartar. Odd combination, but it worked.\n\nKorean BBQ short ribs ($11) - about 5 small pieces of short ribs. The typical sweetness and spicy depth of Korean ribs was replaced with a more mild profile that was dominated mainly by the charred exterior.\n\nPork belly ($21) - very interesting dish, large strip of pork belly with a thick tempura-like exterior topped with cabbage, pears, etc. I loved the different sweet and sour notes of the dish. Bold savory flavors. Biggest issue is that the thick crust takes away from the best part of pork belly --  taking a bite and experiencing the crispiness of the crust, the lusciousness of the fat, and the tenderness of the meat. The crust dominated the textures and while it was a delicious dish it doesn't beat eating a more simple, typical version of pork belly.\n\nChocolate cake ($7) - baked in a tea cup; came with miso ice cream and caramel popcorn, cake was delicate and airy.\n\nStrawberry shortcake ($7) - miso ice cream, whipped cream. I thought it was supposed to be soaked in sake?! I didn't taste it. A decent dessert, but I prefer the chocolate cake.\n\nThey also have a kid's menu for those that want to dine early with the little ones. It's a smart move considering it's the suburbs. Another smart move is the pricing. Way cheaper than eating on the Strip.

The atmosphere reminded me of many my great brunches in NYC. I like that the bar opened up to a little patio and let in the fresh air and sunlight. \n\nAs for the food, everything was well prepared and tasty. \n\nFor starters we had the watermelon salad with goat cheese and the crab toast with mango mustard. The goat cheese was great and it came topped with candied wasabi. It sounds weird, but the flavors really worked well together, and the crunchiness of the candied wasabi offerred a good contrast in texture. The crab toast was good too, my friends really liked the mango mustard, the only critique is that it there was a bit too much mayo, otherwise the amount of crab was decent. \n\nFor my main dish I ordered the egg benedict. Now, my problem with brunch is I'm ALWAYS tempted to try the eggs benedict regardless of where I go. I dunno, its just a comfort food for me I guess. This place though did a great job with their take on a regular brunch staple with perfectly poached eggs, thick cut canadian bacon, and a spicy hollandaise sauce. What was exceptionally unique was that instead of an english muffin, they put everything on top of a polenta cake. Other things we ordered included the kimchi fried rice, the chicken sausage, and mochi pancakes, and each dish was well liked. The mochi pancakes were delicious with fresh berries and creme. I thought it was going to be just a regular pancake with some mochi bits thrown in, but it was like the entire pancake had the texture and flavor of mochi, without it being too sweet or chewy. Well done. \n\nAt first we didn't want any dessert, but the green tea-mint creme brulee caught our eyes. I'm glad we tried it, the flavor was creamy and rich and what made it all so different was the there was a hint of thai chilli in the sugar glaze and in this little cracker that comes with it. So you start with the sweetness of the green tea and mint and it leaves your mouth with the slightest kick from the chilli. Great dessert, presentation was a little bit plain however for such an interesting dish. \n\nOverall: great meal, great athmosphere, very friendly staff.

Examples:\n\nWatermelon salad with goat cheese, a classic, is very refreshing but could benefit from a drizzle of aged balsamic to boost sweetness and complexity.  The hint of wasabi does nothing.  The watermelon lacked the \"in season\" fruity goodness.  Boring.\n\nQuinoa fried rice with sun dried pineapple and tofu is intriguing.  Good first bite but unless you are a quinoa lover, the texture of the and nutty flavor of the grain quickly becomes one dimensional.  The pineapple lacks the acidic punch to brighten the dish.  Interesting.\n\nThe roasted duck breast is delicious.  Perfectly cooked, mid rare.  Mineral duck flavors enhanced by the honey.  A great side of grilled baby bok choy to add bitterness and crunch.  Just be sure to scrape off the ridiculous addition of children's breakfast cereal.   Blood soaked Kix.  Really?  Delicious but.\n\nMiso toffee ice cream.  Wait for it.... Disgusting.

Besides their beautiful smiles, they offer coat check which is not seen normally in other places, even those ones on the strip. On the right hand side, there is a full service bar which can seat about 10 people comfortably. The inside is fairly dark but my eyes are quickly drawn to the beautiful decorations. The lights, the wall papers, the little candle on the table, even the door knobs,etc, some are rusty some are contemporary with Asian influence, it gives a \"arty\" feeling to it.

The tomato soup was very good.  I didn't think the curry whipped cream added anything to the dish but color.

We both enjoyed this.\n\nThe third course was chips and ice cream.  There were two kinds of homemade ice cream, yuzu and poppyseed and lemon and poppyseed accompanied by potato chips stacked vertically in the ice cream.

It was quite refreshing to take sips of this nicely balanced sweet and fruity cocktail. \n\nEveryone says 'if you ever go to Poppy Den, get the QUINOA FRIED RICE\" no joke what they do with the quinoa is nothing short of absolutely amazing not going to dwell on it because several others have already reviewed it and have described it quite better than i can.\n\nThe General's Chicken Wings surely reflect our great nation's military higher ups...old, senile, and adulterous...But the wings on the other hand are friggin amazing! Felix over at the bar recommended them and described them as 'larger than chicken but smaller than turkey' and he wasnt wrong with that description at all. Due to the awesome customer service these were comp'ed as well as a round of drinks for reasons unexplained until the kitchen was cranking out a plate of these once every 10 minutes. These things are quite addictive and wonderfully tasty. Sorry Brian (Wing King)...then again Brian's wings are cheaper and i got 70+ flavors to choose from so it's not a complete jump of the fence to greener grasses just yet.\n\nShrimp and Grits. Not really a Girts kinda guy. Only had them once and it came from a military messing facility so we got the grits no one else wanted to buy made from people who hated their jobs and get entertained by swearing into the food to give it some extra hatred....Anyway, if i wasnt so full from everything else plus the cocktails i surely would have ate the whole damn bowl and not feel an ounce of guilt until Felix told me how much butter went into it...\nThese arent you traditionally cooked grits with lots AND LOTS of butter and cheese for flavor. They added coconut cream and maybe some dried shredded coconut to give it a nice...well coconut flavor which i was not expecting at all. The black tiger prawns were cooked to perfection and were plump and delicious. Would have liked them grilled to give a little smokey shrimp flavor to the coconuttie grits but that's just nit picking.\n\nIf budget wasnt an issue i would not hesitate to eat here until i tasted every single thing on the menu at least once. \n\nThey've got my seal of approval.  \n\n\n\nYelp 100 - 021 of 100", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 5, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "I came here for a late lunch after an afternoon of hiking, and was a little intimidated being a tad dusty from the hike- so I chose to sit outside.

Upon arriving to the restaurant I met some friends who were already seated, and I was greeted by one of them with the statement, \"Hey!  Order your drink/food now because we've been here about 30 minutes and are JUST getting our waters...\" assuming my friends were just being high maintenance I shook it off as always..but no joke the first drink took about 25 minutes, the second took about 20 minutes (and this was after multiple reminders to the server).  The food we ordered as a group came out in shifts so that at one point some of our group was almost finished with their food by the time others had just begun.\n\nI ordered the Korean short ribs which were flavorful but no where near as tender as I'd hoped, and honestly I feel like the meat was no better than the Hawaiian steak I get from the Aloha Grill for half the price.\nI also ordered the Kimchee fried rice, which was tasty, but again I feel as if I've had better for less.  I'm a \"foodie\" so I can appreciate costly food when it's worth it, and again, these dishes were good...

The drink was amazing and refreshing, with a little spicy kick.  For $9 the drink was pretty good, but could have been a little larger (it came in an almost 4-5oz coffee looking mug, but $9 in Vegas for any decent drink is doing well).\n2) This beautiful girl who I believe was a hostess or manager brought us out complimentary Watermelon salads as appetizers due to our wait.

There were 2 ice cream flavors: caramel/toffee and lemon poppy.  Both were good.  It was a great dessert for the texture and sweet and savory elements.  We also got the Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Toffee.  The cake was nice and hot.

It was served in a tiny tea cup that was filled with ice, so the drink got watered down very quickly.  Also, the tequila was so overpowering that I could barely taste the jasmine or lemon, and there was absolutely no bite from the chili pepper, which was the main reason I ordered the drink as I like spicy things.\n\nFood wise, I had the Tuna steak which was recommended by the waiter as well as the kimchee fried rice.  The tuna steak was cooked perfectly, but that is about all the positive that I can say about the dish.  It was served covered in a roasted red pepper/basil/ginger/EVOO \"salsa\" and the red peppers and basil just completely overwhelmed what little flavor the tuna had.  Couldn't even taste any ginger in the dish whatsoever.  Also, the texture on parts of the tuna were off, and so was the flavor.  I described it at one point as tasting as if I was eating semi-firm tofu, as it actually had the flavor along with the texture.  My friend who was dining with me firmly agreed with my assessment as well, so it wasn't just me.  The kimchee fried rice was very meh, and I was disappointed again that there was no kick to it.  There was a very strong flavor of dried shrimp in their, which kind of surprised me but not a lot as I know that it can be used in the making of kimchee.

The restaurant is beautiful and very modern. I love all the decor, including the bathrooms! So, looking over the menu, I wanted the pork belly which I read on Yelp was fantastic! When our server came over, I told him that's what I wanted. He was kind of a jokester, so when he told me that they were using a different cut of pork which isn't pork belly and it's kind of tough and dry, I thought he was joking. So I just laughed and was like \"no, really, I want the pork belly\". But apparently, he wasn't joking. I don't know why they insisted on serving this \"roasted pork belly\" with a different cut of meat rather than just removing it from the menu for the night. That was kind of strange and tells me a lot about this restaurant, in a negative light. Thank goodness the server warned me. I ended up going with the duck which was cooked medium rare I do believe, while my husband ordered the cheeseburger with the kim cheese fries, grilled bok choy, and kim chee fried rice. \n\nThe duck was... alright. It was definitely on the sweet side, and cooked medium rare, it was not that amazing. I'm used to eat duck confit, and Chinese roast duck. Compared to those, I'd say this was sub-par. They were just kind of sweet, extra chewy, pieces of duck breast. The grilled bok choy was a nice side. Having eaten boy choy many different ways growing up, grilling them was pretty unique, but the price was crazy. At a chinese market, you can buy 1lb of bok choy for probably $2. That would come with 10-15 spears. Here, you get 2-3 spears (they are all slices in half) for $7. I think I'll just grill my own bok choy at home next time. The kim chee fried rice tasted like any other kim chee fried rice I've had, and it came in a much smaller portion than I'm used to. \n\nMy husband's burger was weird. There was WAY too much cheese on it, with a strange sauce, and pickled cucumbers (like ban chan cucumbers) that he just didn't like. He didn't even eat more than 1/4th of it.

The Asian influences in all of the dishes is prevalent and robust. It is hard to pinpoint all of the exact components in every dish, because they blend so well together. We ordered close to ten dishes and almost all of them were a hit. Besides the wings, I had a affinity for the tomato and the chilled split pea soup. Both are complex and full bodied. \n\nCons:\nOur table was flooded with food all at once. So the table was full. It could have been coursed out or slowed down. We also got there at the very end of happy hour. We were able to put in some orders, but found out that they scale down the order. The caprese salad was three slices of tomatoes and two butt ends of mozzarella. It was disappointing.

They were strong! \n\nWe started with the watermelon salad with goat cheese. It was an interesting combination of flavors- creamy and rich, but crisp and refreshing. We also had the tabbouleh lettuce wraps- no lettuce necessary- the filling was good on its own. We also shared the duck, which was a little over seasoned, but was balanced nicely with Kix cereal. Everything was served on mismatched dishes that look like they were bought at little old ladies' garage sales. \n\nMy favorite is always dessert. We shared the trio of sorbets: mango, pineapple ginger (my favorite), and a mystery flavor that we couldn't figure out (raspberry? strawberry? watermelon?). The mango was creamy and tasted like you we're eating frozen mango pur\u00e9e. The pineapple ginger was refreshing and I would buy it if I could. It was served on a crispy thin sugar cookie with fresh berries. \n\nPrices were fair. The check was presented in an old children's book, which was a cute detail. Ambience was the best part. The patio seemed larger than the dining room, and even though it was a little warm, the breeze made it feel like summer. \n\nThe only negative was our server. She seemed to talk down to us and invited herself into our conversations. It was very off putting. \n\nI will return to try more of their interesting dishes (and have lots more sorbet!).

The only downside is that I am a slow drinker and it warmed up in the patio area, so the cocktail became room temperature. \n\nThe food was unique, I enjoyed the watermelon salad, caprese salad (another slice of tomato and mozzarella wouldn't hurt), and the chicken wings were scrumptious. The chicken wings had this delicous crust around the chicken meat and then was drizzled in a spicy and sweet asian sauce. If I was dining alone, I could have had the salads and the chicken and make an entire meal. \n\nThe potstickers were fine, and the meatballs were mushy, nothing special. \n\nFrom the regular menu we had the tomato soup, it had a light sweetness to it once it hit your tongue, which then transcended into a light heat. I also got to try the crabcakes, yes they are small, but man are they packed with crab. Chef sosa made a good choice to go with quality over quantity here, and the pickled asian apple pear was a very nice light and refreshing touch to something that is usually so heavy. \n\nFor dessert they were out of the fortune cookie with mango sorbet so we ended up getting the trio of sorbets. The sorbets were very tasty, but the waiter said that we had mango, strawberry, and pineapple ginger. I couldn't taste the ginger, and it tasted more like a pineapple coconut sorbet.

The cookie bowl that it came in was a delite to munch through and acted as a great tool to move the sorbet into the mouth. \n\nService was great, our waiter came to check on us quite often and didn't make a big deal that one party member was 90 minutes late.

I was meeting someone a little later for dinner but wanted to see what Happy Hour was like.  First, Happy Hour is only available in the bar area (not sure about patio).  The happy hour menu is all 5 bucks, several apps, well drinks, & draft beer.  In keeping with an Asian theme, I had a pint of Asahi and the Pork Dumplings.  The dumplings were served like fried won ton triangles (with plenty of tasty pork filling) & sitting in a sweet/sour/spicy sauce.

It is sweet & gingery.  Neither I nor my friend cared much for it.  More on how we got satisfaction at the end.\n- Caprese: Served with large heirloom tomatoes.  This dish was classically flavorful; big slices of tomato & mozzarella, chopped basil, & a great aged balsamic reduction.  I forgot to ask for ground pepper, but truthfully, it didn't need it.\n- Poppy Burger: A great burger with kimchi pickles, fired egg, & magic.  This was served with Poppy Fries (kimchi cheese fries).  The kimchi cheese sauce was so good; sweet, cheesy, spicy.  I will probably order this every time I come here.  WOWZERS!\n\nFinally, the service.  It was good service & friendly, but here is what amazed me.  As my friend ate a spoonful of the Sweet Pea Soup, she made a sour face to me to show her displeasure.  This was seen by our server, who was at another table, who immediately said, \"I assume you didn't like the soup, I'll take that away for you.\"  Obviously, it was also removed from our bill.

Needless to say, the possibility of running into this rare man crush species altogether combined with some of the outstanding reviews this place has received from Yelpers I trust wholeheartedly and I was excited.    Then I ate there.\n\nI met a friend at the bar and she had already started with an appetizer of meatballs (which conveniently were already devoured and all evidence removed).   She did tell me they were delicious, which raised my anticipation even further.   Ever since trying Comme Ca's excellent happy hour and their specialty drinks menu, my fear of specialty cocktails has subsided a bit and I figured who else to trust with my specialty cocktail needs than Angelo!  Started with the Sake Sangria.   It was good.  Really good.   Though I must say the best Sake Sangria I've had yet is still Bachi Burger, so in that sense it was a slight disappointment, but still worth ordering.   While waiting for some food I also ended up trying The Raven and the Poppy Sling.  I found them okay, but they didn't really hit the mark for me completely on either taste nor strength of alcohol.  Sort of regretted not just sticking with a whiskey and coke to be honest.   Back to square one on the specialty drink thing I guess.\n\nStill having high hopes for the food, we received the following:  Crispy Pork Dumplings, Chicken Wings, Quinoa Fried Rice with Pineapple, a side of fries and a side of Shishito peppers.   Sadly nothing really excited me.  The Pork Dumplings were fine, but didn't really stand out to me any more than ones I could get at TGI Fridays.  The wings were similar for me, in that they tasted okay, but they seriously just tasted like the Pizza Hut/Wingstreet Asian BBQ wings.   I'm going to go out on a limb and say that was not the desired result.  The quinoa fried rice is raved about on here and was probably the item I was most looking forward to, and yet I found it overly sweet and barely finished half of the plate.  All I can remember of the flavor was that yup, I tasted pineapple all right.  Shishito peppers offered nothing new, and the fries were par for the course as well.   I will say I did enjoy the kim chee dipping sauce quite a bit, especially the more I had of it.\n\nOn the plus side, the service for the most part was exceptional.

But what I also like about this place is allowing the texture of the food to stand out as much as the flavor. Here's what I mean:\n\nFor example, I don't usually order edamame at restaurants because they all taste the same, but here, the edamame was mixed with turmeric oil, ginger and togarashi (Japanese pepper spice) making it the BEST EDAMAME I've ever had. \n\nThe heirloom tomato salad with steak was PERFECT. I loved the use of thai basil. The balsamic vinegar was sweet without being overly acidic. The steak was so tender, we could cut it with the butter knife. \n\nThe charred bok choy was simple, crisp and refreshing.\n\nThe quinoa fried rice with sun-dried pineapple and baby(?) cilantro brought a classic fried rice concept with a new texture by using quinoa. \n\nI liked the tomato soup, the flavor came in three phases; first you taste sweetness, followed by the tomato acidity then a spicy kick after it passes the back of your tongue. I think there's chipotle in there providing the spicy aftertaste. But it was a little too sweet for me. \n\nWe came here for Saturday lunch, the bartender was super friendly, enthusiastic and outgoing. He made great recommendations and even offered to see if the kitchen could make dinner items that aren't on the lunch menu. \n\nI eat a lot of Asian/Oriental style meals (Japanese, Thai, Korean) weekly and Poppy Den is really something special.

And hopefully set the record straight for all of you gastronomes with discriminating taste.\n     I have traveled extensively in Asia. I have also worked as a Sommelier for Chef Joel Robuchon at his premier restaurant. He has earned more Michelin stars than any other chef in the world...My standards and expectations are extremely high indeed.\n     If you crave bland, boring, outdated cuisine with no texture... Angelo Sosa is NOT the chef for you. Angelo has lived and worked extensively in Asia and this is glaringly evident in his cuisine. Each and every dish exemplified this point to me. A careful selection of only the freshest ingredients with bright flavor, fragrance, and texture that seamlessly coalesce into a delicious and truly orgasmic gastronomic experience of seamless perfection. Each dish I savored had the sharp precision, form, and balance of a Japanese Katana!!!\n     My goal of dining there last night was to see if Angelo Sosa is all that, or just another celebrity chef blessed by television reality show exposure. I admit that I have worked with some of those Chefs while I was working in Los Angeles whose talents are in the words of Michael Broadbent \"slightly under performing\".\nWith this in mind, I asked my waiter Matt (who I strongly recommend) to ask Angelo to cook whatever he wants to. I do not have any dietary restrictions.\n     The amuse bouche was the epitome of what am amuse should be. It is something bright and flavorful with vibrant acidity to open up your palate. You'd be amazed how many Michelin starred restaurants I have dined at that defy this very premise.\nSome of the dishes that I found very impressive include:\nEdamame with togarashi\nAsian white fish with herbs and olive oil that made me feel like I was back in Hanoi dining at the finest restaurant there.\nPersian cucumbers in asian spice\nPineapple fried rice\nDuck that was even better than the original Peking Duck restaurant in Beijing.\nWatermelon with greens and fish sauce( a wonderful sensation of sweet and salty flavors.\nAnd the grand finale.... A homemade fortune cookie with berries and same featuring five different textures.\nAngelo's cuisine is a Sommeliers dream as I could think of at least 10 wines that would match each dish perfectly.\n     I enjoyed the cozy yet hip ambiance at Poppy Den. The timing of the food and service was impeccable. Angelo Sosa is a culinary Genius!!! He was very warm and explained each dish. He spends time to visit all of his guests in the restaurant. His affordable cuisine is reasonably priced and is a wonderful gastronomic experience that you will treasure and soon wish to revisit. Poppy Den is my new favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.

And so it is written, so it shall be done.  \n\nAdC is incredibly creative and unpredictable with their menu despite themselves and the overworked 'fusion' theme.  Some examples of AdC fare: crab croquetas with red pepper remoulade and chile-ponzu dipping sauce, spicy Szechuan scallops with salsa verde and chorizo-lemon grass espuma, Cuban-spiced chicken with a tamarind glaze, plantain-crusted Spanish mackerel with curried noodles, pan-seared ahi with wasabi-mashed potatoes and chimichurri sauce, grilled mojito-glazed strip steak with a mango sauce infused with sak and foie gras.\n\nI mean, whats NOT to like?  Sure the atmosphere is slightly prom-ish, but you'll find that you will get over it quickly.  Its surprisingly cozy in the surroundings, and, as a personal pleaser to my eye-palate, the decor, from staff to furniture to art, is drowned in white.  I've been to the AdC in San Francisco and felt more like a power-lunch spot than a 'dinner as an event' place.  The menus were nearly the same, but apparently design, decor, and atmosphere differ drastically from one to the next.  So, if you've been to one AdC, you most certainly haven't been to them all.

And I do this even though I know that newly opened restaurants inevitably have kinks to be worked out. I have been walking by Sens for months now and I've watched them put it together piece by piece and have been waiting for it to open. And what do you know, it opens the night of the Yelp party. Since I couldn't go to the opening, my husband and I decided to go on the second night. In reality this turned out much better because it was intimate and we were able to take a nice leisurely pace with the meal. Even the servers were saying it was better we came in when we did rather than for the opening since it was crazy and nobody really knew what was going on. \n\nI'm giving Sens 4 stars because yes, there are kinks to be worked out. I know that I will be there often given its proximity to my place and I fully anticipate giving it that 5th star once said kinks have been worked out. \n\nThe Space- Think Asian diner/lounge. Yes, it is small, and the tables for two are not large enough to fit more than one plate at a time (slightly problematic for a place that serves small plates). There is a small lounge area off to the side which would make a really nice space for a semi private party. (They do take reservations, just call ahead). The bar and bar seating are definitely right in the main dining room. \n\nThe Drinks- They sure know how to appeal to customers. We were offered complimentary shots of their infused drinks of blood orange sake (pass), pineapple sake (good), and lychee shochu (very good). My husband ordered a spicy mama, which had Thai chili infused shochu. My husband adores spicy drinks and this one really made him happy... reminded him exactly of the Thai chili martini that he gets at our favorite Thai place of all time in our hometown. \n\nThe Food- There is nothing subtle about the food. Flavor is strong and very present. We chose four small plates, as we do in all small plate/tapas restaurants. We find four is always the perfect number. The first dish that arrived at the table was the clay pot lemongrass clams, which I would pass on in the future. The second dish was the volcano flamed beef which I would have to say was the best dish that we ordered, mainly because the flavors were the most subtle here- a little bit of peanut, a dash of mint. We did have 4 strips of steak and 2 lettuce wraps though, putting 2 strips of steak into one wrap was a bit much for me. The third dish was the seseme tofu which was very well cooked. Finally we finished with the ginger fish. When fish is cooked in a banana leaf it should absorb all the flavor from the cooking method, there was no reason for heaps of ginger to be placed on top of the fish. It was incredibly overwhelming. Our side of soba noodles were standard, even if they were delivered to our table after all of the other plates had arrived. They do not offer dessert so don't plan on having it there. \n\nThe Service- All the servers were very friendly and engaging. They did feel the need to tell us how to eat every dish we ordered which I found annoying. I know there are a lot of people out there who have no clue but its best to ask us if we know how to cook our meat on the hot rock (sort of shabu shabu style). \n\nAll in all I can see myself here often. The price is just right- the four small plates were more than enough to satisfy my husband and I for dinner and they came to $32 total.

I hate those things.  If you are going to give me 8oz of soda, you shouldn't charge me $3.  I'm okay being raped for soda as long as I am given free refills.  I know it costs you about a penny to fill up a 32oz cup (that is 1/2 full of ice) and it would take a lot of refills to dent your profit margin...so stop selling me your glass \"screw the environment\" bottle of soda that I am going to polish off in one gulp for $3.

Coming from the Bay Area, where \"modern Asian,\" \"Asian fusion,\" and \"Asian tapas\" places are a dime a dozen, it's hard not to compare Sens to the many great places that have mastered the whole upscale pan-Asian thing. That being said, I think Sens has three goings for it that many small plates places I've been to do not:\n\n1. Value. While Phoenicians might think that Sens is expensive for how much food you ultimately get, the prices are actually quite low compared to a lot of Asian tapas places I've been. Four of us each paid around $175 for a full meal (which, for us big eaters, consisted of 8-10 dishes) and drinks. To put things in perspective, diners at the \"modern Vietnamese\" place where I used to work would drop that much between two people to truly be full and get a taste of everything. \n\n2. Great drinks. A lot of upscale Asian places offer fun-sounding drinks but they tend to be some sort of syrupy tropical fluff rather than well-executed cocktails that really complement the food. Not so at Sens. The strawberry basil martini I got was well-sized, strong (in terms of the vodka), and had enough sweetness to balance the food (but wasn't too saccharin). My friend's and my husbands got some spicy drinks (called \"Hot Mama\" and some other similarly titillating name), which seemed like an unwise move given the fact that our food was already spicy, but the drinks themselves were awesome. Definitely better than the grotesque Pad Thai martini at Sens' sister restaurant, Fate. \n\n3. Relative uniqueness. Nothing like Sens exists in downtown Phoenix, let alone in a 15-mile radius around it. That makes it cool--at least for now. In 5 years, I can imagine Phoenix being filled with upscale Asian places with specialty drinks, small plates to share, and zen-like decor. At that point, Sens will have to reinvent itself to survive. But for now, it stands alone and that's worth a shout-out. \n\nAnyone who knows me knows that I won't end a restaurant review without discussing the food at least briefly. Sens has good food, but some of the flavors just feel like a forced attempt to make something taste \"Asian.\" The cold duck in five-spice sauce and the dipping sauces for the tofu dishes (although I loved the tofu) were just a bit sugary for my taste--more reminiscent of Americanized Chinese than more authentic cuisine. In the end, the dishes I enjoyed the most were the ones that blended something unexpected with an Asian flavor--the perfect example was the red curry chicken wings. What could be better than greasy fried wings coated in a zesty and spicy curry sauce? The sugar cane pork was also a unique dish that combined chop-like pieces of pork with an unexpected stroke of sweetness. \n\nI truly appreciate what Sens brings to the table figuratively and almost all of what it brings to the table in the literal sense.

The restaurant is very cozy, with space for maybe 50 diners.  Our table wobbled, something we solved by shoving extra chopsticks under the base.  It's the hazard of a concrete floor I suppose.  While the decor seemed very relaxing and almost spa-like, the music felt incongruent.  It wasn't exactly Top 40s, but it was a bit more upbeat and I think some of the more calm music out of Asia might have been more appropriate.  \n\nWe were seated relatively quickly (too many cushions on that couch!) and were asked for our drink order.  My dinner companion just wanted water, but I typically take hot green tea when I'm in an asian establishment.  The waitress seemed confused by my request and said \"We have two kinds, Oolong and Jasmine\".  I asked for Jasmine and she walked off to go get it.  What she brought back was...interesting.  It had nothing to do with green tea, or any actual tea that I know of.  There was just a single blossom of what I can only assume is jasmine, sitting in the hot water.  Very pretty, but I was less than impressed with parts of it started clogging the spout, making it difficult to pour.  The tea was delicious, but it was a floral tea.  I was hoping for actual tea.  Jasmine can be used as an additional component of green tea, but this was just a blossom of Jasmine.\n\nWe ordered the cold duck, beef carpaccio, mango and papaya salad with shrimp, napa wraps, and pork gyoza.\n\nThe duck was very good.  The Five Spice sauce was well-balanced.  The duck was good, if a little overcooked, which a night in the fridge only made the texture more like cold liver.  Still, I did enjoy it.\n\nNext up was the beef carpaccio; doused with lime juice and mint chiffonade, served on prawn crackers.  The crackers were a bit too delicate for their cargo, but my real complaint was the dish.  All I could taste was mint with lime.  I really had to fight to identify the beef.\n\nThen we had the salad.  I was hoping for a pleasantly sweet and mildly savory dish.  What we got looked very nice on the plate, but both me and my companion simply could not deal with the abundance of pickled ginger.  It was so powerful, I couldn't taste anything else.  I couldn't even find anything that looked like fruit.  There were long strings of what might have been papaya, if it had been allowed to ripen.  Under the ginger fire, all I could really identify was that it could have been carrot.  Four shrimp were served along side; the most perfectly cooked shrimp I have had in quite some time.  \n\nThe napa wraps were simple enough; mushrooms and more of that perfect shrimp rolled up in a cabbage leaf and steamed.  We were unable to determine the best way to eat them, as they were bigger than an amuse bouche, but with only chopsticks, we had to deal and open wide.  The mechanics of eating were tricky, but the dish itself gave us more shrimp and I had no complaints.\n\nThe final course they brought was the pork gyoza.  I've had enough of these to expect a loose-pack pork and ginger sausage with a steamed or fried (sometimes both) wonton wrap.  These were the steamed kind, but the treasure they held inside was phenomenal.  I wanted more, but we had to leave.\n\nThis was my first asian tapas experience. Perhaps some of my criticism comes from my french culinary upbringing.  I will definitely be going here again, if only for more shrimp and gyoza.

GREAT DRINKS! \n\nTo eat, we dined like royalty on the following dishes:\n\nLa Nho, lemongrass marinated beef wrapped in grape leaves.\n\nVolcano Flamed, thinly sliced beef seared on hot stone. The beef actually comes to the table raw, and you literally cook it for 40 seconds per side on a hot stone. Very cool.\n\nShu Mai, wasabi pork and shrimp dumplings. Very tasty, with a kick!\n\nPapaya Mango Salad with shrimp in a lime vinegarette.\n\nWasabi Soy chicken breast, marinated and served with rock salt wasabi.\n\nLemongrass Soy chicken breast - this was probably my favorite dish!\n\nSpicy Wonton filled with sauteed chicken and pepperjack cheese.\n\nRed curry tofu - We ordered a side of steamed rice, which you really have to do in order to enjoy all of the amazing sauce in this claypot dish.\n\nand, finally, Quail seasoned with aromatic rock salt.\n\nI would order everything all over again. I loved that we got to try a little bit of everything, and we had such a fun time eating, chatting, drinking ... It was hard to leave! \n\nOn a side note, I had the opportunity to chat with owner/executive chef Johnny Chu about the creation of Sens vs what's happening over at the restaurant-formerly-known-as-Fate.

She told us it would be about 20 minutes, and we were seated in 7 at the most.  As we were waiting we took a look at the lil drink menu on the waiting table.  Quickly learned that all their martini's were served with Infused Vodkas, like Thai Chili, or Ginger, what a concept.  Once seated, we were served water and asked if we wanted to order drinks.  i had to try the hot & dirty martini, I usually only drink dirty martini's.  I will not get it again, but my love for vodka is really fading anyway.  The BF had one of the drinks, too, but i think it was one of the saketini's, it was grapefruit jasmine something and it was fantastic.  I'm afraid of fruity drinks, but this was perfect, not too sweet and not to fruity.  Just right!\n\nNow on to ordering, after studying the menu for a good ten to twenty minutes we order 3 things, and then asked our waitress what the trend seemed to be for 2 people.  She said just start with three and see how you feel!  Freaking fantastic idea, thanks for suggesting this even though your are totally busy, and there are plenty of people waiting to get a table.  Three was a good starting point, once you get started, you are very eager to try your next flavor explosion.

I even pulled out some of the Basil leaves and munched on them.\n\nVolcano Flamed - thin slices of beef you cook on a hot rock at your table.  This one should win on presentation alone, I loved cooking this on the hot rock, it was neato bandito!  I can't remember what the toppings were but I want to say like bean sprouts marinated in lime teryaki or something, super good!\n\nShu Mai - pork and shrimp dumplings with a little bit of wasabi paste served on top.  Perfect dumpling texture, great kick with the wasabi paste\n\nWasabi Soy - chicken with a wasabi soy - I'm now going to make this at home.  The chicken was great alone, but the wasabi soy made it!  A little boat of thick soy sweet soy sauce with a thick wasabi sauce strip in the middle.  \n\nLime Mint Beef - Very good, maybe too limey, but I really did like it.\n\nI walked away ranting about how I wasn't going to shut up about this place for weeks!

When we called back a few days later, we were told it could only hold 22 people but we were assured our reservation was on the books for the back room.

I was not thrilled about the change in plans and everyone seated at different tables but we made it work. Had we known that was going to be the case in the first place, we would never have made the reservation there so that was pretty annoying.

My glass of Sauvignon Blanc hit the spot with my spicy meal, the saketini with fruit flavors was good without being too sweet, and the Spicy Mama never failts to disappoint. \n*The food really hits the spot, especially after drinking. We went there on Christmas Day after a very extended brunch and on Saturday night after happy hour and everything tasted just right - savory, spicy, hearty. Just the kind of flavors you need to soak up the booze :). I will say, though, that the $2 price tag for the scoop of rice is a bit excessive. With all that great sauce, there really should be more rice for the price (yes, that rhymes). \n*The server we've had pretty much every time is very energetic and makes you feel like you're having a fun dining experience. She could be a bit more attentive once the meal's in progress, but I like her vibe. \n\nAnd, if you needed a fourth reason to love Sens, they just unveiled a brand new indoor-outdoor bar (getting rid of the little private room they had before), as well as an outdoor area with loungey furniture. The bar is gorgeous, with custom tilework and the whole look is just really sleek.

I agree with one review that all the sauces taste alike with different amounts of spiciness.  Nevertheless, I liked all the dishes my friend and I shared: tuna tartare, ground pork on sugar cane, duck salad, fried quail, and green tea cheesecake.  Some comments: the tuna chunks were too big to be considered a tartare, the duck salad was a little plain considering it has the same sauce as the tartare and the pork, and the pork portion is relatively big for those complaining about small plates.  \n\nThe drink menu is extensive with a good selection of sake and cocktails.  I had a shochu drink which was tasty but got watered down by the ice really quickly.  My friend's saketini was also good.

There is the large bar and main dining room buzzing with conversation and sounds from the DJ. There is the outside patio and access to the side bar (but no heat outside). There is a small sitting area...on my night, mostly occupied by the DJ. And then, there is the gem...the side bar tucked away to the left of the main bar. It has a darker ambiance with a large garage door to the outside. It is the kind of space that instantly had me say -- I swear I have seen this place on Bourdain when he went to Japan. I personally would sit nowhere else. It's cozy, just dark enough, and sexy...plus you are just steps away from the buzz of the main room. \n\nSo, there I sat, already a fan of the space, then I opened the drink list. Wow. Fantastic sake list. I asked, do you have any unfiltered sake, and the bartender started to list off a good half dozen or more nigori sakes, a pleasant change from the usual response of...yes, we have this one. Add to that, creative cocktails and a very good Japanese beer selection and it's worth a stop just for those things. But...then, there is the creative food. \n\nThe ginger mint duck salad...well, I love duck, and this dish is a light refreshing take on duck, a great start. The quail, cool presentation, great flavor, but be warned, it is clearly a small bird and there is no hiding that. The bacon lychee, odd, creative, but probably not worth a second try. Then...the sugar cane pork...fantastic! Once again, Bourdain comes to mind, because this is simply porkalicious...a good balance of sauce and slightly fatty pork flavor with the perfect texture. \n\nAbout the only bad point was the DJ spinning Dave Matthews with some dance beats...ummm, no...don't do that. Also, the bathroom light is blue, and combined with the bar frogs, it could cause a nasty flashback, but assuming you are over those moments, it's a nice quirk.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Sure the place has atmosphere and a good drink menu, but I prioritize the eats. \n\nWe went on a Monday night for a friend's birthday with a semi-large group and they did a prixe-fix menu.

Everything we ordered was fantastic! We started off with sizzling shrimp in a spicy red sauce. The shrimp was perfect and sauce was actually spicy. Nothing pisses me off more than when restaurants cater to the wimpy masses by having their \"Spice-O-Meter\" equivalent to that of a kindergartner with an ulcer. The soup gyoza, bacon wrapped dates, sugar cane pork, and bacon wrapped okra were all just as good.  For dessert we had bacon-wrapped lychees (bacon was clearly the theme of the evening) and it was pretty much the perfect conclusion to the fantastic meal.\n\nEven though I've only been to Sens twice, it's slowly creeping up my list of favorite restaurants in Phoenix and will probably only continue to climb as I visit more often.

I don't think they even serve any food that costs more than $10. \n   We shared 2 bottles of nigori (they're sake menu is great).

Be warned about the sauces that accompany most of the tapas - they are HOT!  I love spicy foods, but still found that scooping out some of the chili paste before mixing the sauces together was necessary, so I didn't light my mouth on fire.

As I have mentioned in other reviews, I love all types of food from all over the world. I didn't care for this place.

There are also jars of really weird floating things at the bar (probably pickled/preserved veggies/meat/fruits etc.) it was unappetizing to be around....I don't have a weak stomach at all, it was just odd. The second time I went in, the service was equally as bad. there was a table of 8 of us for lunch and the place was mostly dead and I had to go up and ask them to take our order after we sat waiting for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the menu is small and the prices are high with not much room for substitutions or changes\n\nBottom bun: I like the owner, he is really nice and friendly. The cooks were also friendly.

It incorporated lightly fried tofu that melted in your mouth without the rubbery texture that can sometimes leave you guessing.

Between $5 and $11 a pop for these snacks, you'll find yourself spending way more than you would if you just ate an entree at a real restaurant.. Beyond that, items are pretty bland, and they really rely on sauces to come alive. I couldn't taste a hint of goat cheese in the wontons, and the Thai chicken lollipops were bland. They had to be drenched in wasabi or chili sauce.\n\nI then realized I noticed a pattern. Bland fare that caters to a mainstream crowd who actually hasn't sampled Asian snacks. I will admit that it looks awesome. I'll admit that it tastes good, but then again tasting good doesn't mean it's authentic or worth it. Maybe I'll be back to try more items, in hopes that I'm all wrong. In the meantime, this Yelper has been jaded by similar (yet superior) places in Southern California.

Thank you Yelp! We had a fantastic experience here. Loved the decor and atmosphere both inside and out. Decent prices for tapas style plates, and we were actually pleasantly surprised at how much food each item included. We split three dishes and a pot of Hot and Sour soup between four people, and couldn't even finish everything! They have a pretty good mix of Asian cuisine and some very unique dishes. We got the Papaya Soba Spring Rolls - they were the kind of rolls you'd get at a Vietnamese place - with a red pepper sauce with crushed peanuts. The sauce had a decent kick to it. The rolls were fresh and tasty. We also got the Ginger Fish - YUM. Very tender, great sauce, tender veggies, a real kick in the taste buds. Delicious. Our friend ordered the Sugarcane Pork since we had seen some great reviews on Yelp and LOVED it - it came in a pretty nifty serving dish with four cups and some sweet mushroom sauce in the bottom of each one. We're vegetarian so had to take his word for it :)  Finally we ordered a pot of the Hot and Sour soup with fish. Wow. So completely unique and different from any Hot and Sour soup we've ever had. All three of us agreed that each bite had like three or four distinct flavors to it. It included okra, mushrooms, fish, snow peas, rice ovalettes, cilantro, and I don't even know what else. \n\nThe only drawback and our reason for not giving five stars: The drink menu. While it was pretty enormous, the server went down the beer list and told us everything they were out of, which included most of the beer list and my favorites. I finally ordered one I wasn't that excited about, and then lo and behold, they were out of that too! So no drinks for me or our friend. My lady ordered the Ginger Peach sake cocktail. The $10 price made me cringe a little, but we hoped it would be worth it. You could definitely taste the sake, but it didn't seem like anything special and was not very big at all. Definitely way overpriced. \n\nWe'll be back for sure - but next time we'll wait to drink until we go to Filmbar or Lost Leaf where the drink prices are so much more reasonable.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "We had a horrible service experience here.

Fans of Mr. Chu, we decided to give Sens a try, hoping that all of those great times at Fate could be revived ;)\n\nWhile Sens certainly isn't the same, it was still a breath of fresh air.

This is one of three in this location that will be opened, coming soon, Canteen and El Rey...so I've been told.\n\nAfter you get through the very heavy front door (grandma is not going to eat tonight if she has to handle that door) you'll notice the place has been improved quite nicely with metal framed windows, door frames and a large mirror.  Also notable are the 70s style prints throughout the cozy space.  Although it's still warm (they're working through A/C issues), you'll find the staff and kitchen (visible) will greet you with a smile and in our case at the soft opening, a choice of a glass of chilled chardonnay or a cold sake!\n\nThe menu is still in flux and not all items were available, but the selection was still quite large.  We sampled quite a few items and in most cases, they were all very tasty.  The prices for the items available ranged from $8 to $13 for the starters, and when the full entrees are available, they appear to be in the $15-20 range. \n\nBottles of wine are $30-40, with glasses from $8-13.  The selection is fairly minimal with only about 7 reds and 5-6 whites from Spain, New Zealand, South America, and California.  Cold Sakes are $12 for 300ml (a bit high) and there are about 5 choices.  I find these prices slightly high for the quality of wines and sakes available, but at the bottled wine price, not so bad.  As much as I love chilled sake, unless there is a special I probably will pass unless the quality improves.\n\nFood:  Along with the fantastic service, we found the food to be very delicious.  We started with the duck confit buns, which are really a play on Hong Kong style duck where you'd make up your bun, crispy duck skin, hoisin sauce and shrimp cracker...  however this version consisted of a larger Hong Kong style steamed bun, duck confit, a different play on the sauce and green onion along with a slice of green apple.  I thought the confit was good, but not excellent (like Christopher's), the steamed bun too sticky (over steamed?) but all around not a bad effort.  I think this one can only improve and I will try it again as I love confit.  This was the only item I thought that needed some work, it could have just been the gooey bun that threw me off.  \n\nAll of the other items were top notch, very flavorful and perfect temperatures with the right amount of seasonings.  Some items such as the Shrimp and Coconut fried rice were spicier than you'd expect but well within reason and added a little kick to make them perfect. \n\nThe fried rice was excellent, I really loved having the texture of the shaved coconut with the rice and although a lot of egg, it was the perfect amount to make it rich and delicious.  I would actually prefer a small poached egg or overeasy quail egg on the top just to get some yolky goodness, I guess I'll have to do that at home with the leftovers...\n\nThe shrimp lettuce wraps were among my favorites, nice spicy perfectly fried shrimp in a cool lettuce wrap.  As all starters come in threes, these are difficult to share with two....  I will order this again next time, it's a nice cool and spicy treat.\n\nMy very top favorite was the pork belly crepe.  Although the crepe in texture was not so different from the 'bun' of the confit dish, the crepe with the pork belly is absolutely magnificent paired with the wasabi yogurt.  This was pork belly at its best (well, yes, Filipino fans, you know the other best pork belly), but Matt's subtle and delicious pork is among the tastiest I've had.  He knows his pork and the belly he serves here in several incarnations is well worth the trip.\n\nThe last dish was dessert, which the wife had the blueberry (cake?) and lychee ice cream all made on site.  Very sweet but perfectly delicious.  I cannot pass up tapioca and this paired with toasted coconut, strawberries, and butterscotch was a fine finish to a terrific meal.  I actually might have preferred the tapioca with only (add more please) coconut, but the overlarge (shareable) portion was a nice subtle and not oversweet finish to a very nice meal.\n\nThis is a nice destination for a delicious meal and I can't wait for the weather to cool off so that they can open up the large garage doors and open the interior to the beautifully set up patio.  Inside they have about 11 tables (2 and 4 tops) and outside looks like a treat once the weather behaves.

It's this kind of attention that shows in the service and every aspect of the experience, including the well planned menu.\n\nPlate presentations are some of the prettiest I've seen in quite some time. During both occasions we shared appetizers, then each ordered an entree, which can be shared family style.\nPortions are generous, and the chef does a fantastic job keeping things from getting too heavy.\n\nThe crisp, clean flavors of the Cucumber Salad ($8) was a great way to get things moving. The bright and light Octopus Sashimi ($12) had a wonderful flavor from the pickled chilies, more sweet than spicy, yet balanced, though the octopus was a little on the chewy side.\n\nFried items were piping hot, starting with the Tomato Katsu ($9), which was lightly breaded and nicely crisp. Beware of that first bite, these were hot, hot, hot! The heirloom tomato was nice and ripe resulting in deeply satisfying flavors.\n\nThe Rice Cakes ($7) had a nice crunch, but these were really to show off the tasty cilantro-lime coconut yogurt drizzled onto the plate. If I had a bowl of that yogurt I would have dipped everything into it. Good stuff!\n\nDuck and Foie Dumplings ($11) were good, but I wish the foie flavor would have been more pronounced. It's a personal taste.\n\nThe Korean Chicken Wings ($8) were tender, crispy, meaty and interesting with the topping of chili threads. I've actually never had a chili thread before, so small and thin but wow, what a flavor explosion!\n\nEntrees were a blast, beginning with n ample bowl of Red Curry Mussels ($18). These plump bad boys were made for the fragrant coconut and lemongrass curry broth. The chef also piles on thick slices of bread so as not to waste even a single drop of the complex elixir.\n\nEating the Pork Belly Fried Rice ($13) was a pleasure, savoring each bite of tender hog and sweet spiked caramelized pineapple. I asked for a side of their pickled chilies to add a spicy sweet dimension to the tender rice.\n\nBe sure to use the chilies also on the Tonkotsu Ramen ($15). A huge steaming bowl of richly flavored broth and noodles topped with pork belly, scallions and an egg. You know how I get when there is egg yolk involved, the flavor just drives me wild, while it adds a certain richness to just about any dish.\n\nDesserts ($7 each) are limited to only a few thoughtful selections. The Blueberry Mochi Cake was moist and chewy, adorned with fresh berries and a scoop of lychee sorbet was refreshing. However, I would have preferred a different flavor of sorbet, since I'm one of those few people who think lychee tastes like soap. It's just a preference.\n\nThe Coffee and Chocolate Torte was more my style. With its fudge-like texture and smooth and flavorful chai ice cream, it's real winner.\n\nWith great attention to detail, delicious food and a superb staff, I think you will find plenty to be happy about after a visit here. On my way out I couldn't help but think of an excuse to come back, then I was told that the lunch menu is outstanding.

I had the Blueberry Mochi cake with passion fruit and Lychee sorbet.

It was cutting edge to name your bar/restaurant after your street address early in the decade.  Now it's just overdone and cliche.  I implore restaurant owners to dig deep in their creative souls and actually come up with a real name for their establishment.\n\nAnyway...as many people have noted, the decor of Nine05 borrows a lot from Fate, but I agree with those that have said it is a more \"complete\" look.  \n\nThe service is much friendlier now than it was with Fate.  But the menu is restrictively pricey for mediocre food.  The good news is that it keeps the grody pseudo-hipsters away, making it a good place for a downtown resident to have a casual drink and decent meal without feeling like an outcast for having a professional job and wearing a collared shirt.  Of course, it also means that the place tends to get a little Scottsdale-y at times, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just something to be aware of if you're an elitist with a blood-thirsty hatred of Scottsdale.  \n\nReally the only thing that Nine05 brings to the table is the outdoor bar.

Thank you, thank you, thank you Nine 05 for not being another Fate.\n\nI ordered the house made lychee soda to drink and I loved it!  It was perfectly sweet and efervescent, really, a perfect complement to my meal.  We chose the rice cakes as a starter , and we definitely weren't sure what to expect.

The coconut cream sauce served alongside it was perfect when drizzled with a bit of soy sauce.\n\nFor my entree I chose the Tonkotsu Ramen.  I really had no idea what I was getting other than noodles and pork belly.  I'm not an expert on Asian food or the way it should be prepared, but this was scrumptious.  It was a rather chilly night and I didn't have a coat or anything and the soup warmed me from the inside out.  The broth had a light flavor that slowly developed into a spice that got you right in the back of the throat.

The pork was cooked perfectly and the sauce was a very nice sweet/bitter combo.  The pear stuff was possibly my favorite part of the meal.  Very strong flavor with a great consistency.  The beans, however, were a bit of a disaster.  I tried to eat them first, fearing they would get cold, but they were already starting to get cold by the time my plate came out.  I ate a bit until I couldn't handle any more.  I gave up after that and ate the rest of my meal.  I came back to the beans and they were ice cold at this point.

Boyfriend used the BBQ sauce on his bowl and it was incredibly flavorful as well. \n\n-Ample toppings of extras. The herb mix gave the PERFECT minty/basily pop throughout the bowl. The lime wedges gave the perfect amount of final bright flavor.

Their peanut sauce is labeled \"Two nuts walk into a bar...\" which is cute and obviously their peanut sauce, but listing out the ingredients as it's shown on their website could probably save both staff and customer some time.\n\n-Girl forgot to top boyfriend's bowl with his sauce.

You choose whether you want rice or noodles, and then you can pile on as much vegetables as your little bowl can handle.  There is a variety of sauces at the end and tasting cups so you can have a vague idea what your meal is going to taste like.  The sauces give a shout out to most Asian cuisine, but I cannot attest to their authenticity. (Chinese, Thai, Korean, Japanese, etc.) After you chose your starch, your veggies, and your meat, you can choose whether to have your meal with flat bread, seafood added, tofu added, stir fried, made into a salad, or made into a soup. (There are probably more choices, I just can't remember them.)  Additionally, you have an option to indicate that you have a food allergy so your food is placed on a separate clean grill.  Additionally you can make this an all you can eat event for $1-$1.50 more, but then you pay extra to take any food home.\nFor vegetarians, there is EVERY KIND, of fake meat available on the bar.  However, during busy times, vegetarians, no one seems to  gives a damn if the beef in the protein area accidentally slips into sauces that border that side, so if you're a rigid vegetarian, be weary.  My dining companion wished that he had indicated he had a food allergy because he insisted he could taste the sauces I put on my food on his food. I also want to add, on the night that we went, our service was not good, and we saw at least one other patron expressing her dissatisfaction with the service with the manager. We managed to have a pleasant dining experience despite this, and I'm crediting the poor service to the fact that it's a new restaurant and they may still working out the kinks.\nWe both enjoyed our meals and are considering coming back at a later date to do the all you can eat option just so we could experiment a little more with different concoctions.

Overall, service was sweet and fine.  This definitely isn't the best location I've been to and I'm not sure I'd rush to go back to this particular one.

It seemed like a fun place to go with groups of people, because everyone can get exactly what they want.  The first two times I ate here were okay, but since then things have gone down the tubes.  I'm not sure if things actually changed or if the newness wore off for me, but I won't be going back.\n\nTo begin, you can't hear a thing your dining partners are saying.  It must be the acoustics in the building, but it is impossible to have a conversation over any of the tables.\n\nI don't eat meat, so I was excited to get my hands on some veggies and meat-free options.  Alas, most of the veggies tend to be the stemmy parts you don't really want to eat.  I realize this is cheaper for them, but no one wants to eat a bowl of broccoli stems.  None of the veggies ever look all that fresh, either.  \n\nI learned to skip over the faux-meat, which doesn't have any taste here.  It also takes up valuable real estate in the bowl.  If you are going the meat-free route, I suggest adding tofu at the end.\n\nAs previous reviewers have mentioned, I've never been able to concoct tasty sauces.  No matter what I do (follow their recipes, invent my own), my dishes end up tasting bland.  Once, I did make some flavorful sauce, but it was so spicy I could barely eat it.  My boyfriend loves the sauce, but I think he just dumps on soy and  teriyaki sauces.  For the record, I can't stand teriyaki.  The smell makes me ill.\n\nThe last time I was at Flat Top, another customer obviously didn't pay attention to the server's tutorial and was observed touching one of the sauce ladles to uncooked meat.  This grossed me out so much, I barely ate.  This particular infraction involved teriyaki sauce (we are destined to stay apart!), but it makes me queasy to think about what else goes on at that food bar.\n\nI haven't eaten meat in eight years, and don't have plans to start anytime soon.  Alas, the last time I ate here I spent a considerable amount of time picking chicken out of my dish.  I don't have food allergies so I'm not going put the stick in my dish that says I do, but it's be nice if they cooked all dishes separately.\n\nAgain, as previous reviewers have mentioned, the food arrives VERY hot.  I guess it means all the germs from people who can't follow directions are killed off, but it also means you have to sit for 15 minutes (not engaging in conversation with your friends or family, because you can't hear them) before you can eat.", "review_stars": 1, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "This is a restaurant for big eaters.

It is some combo that includes fish (was told it was bonito) and other spices. Not overpowering. Just delicious.

The veggies may vary a bit but are napa cabbage, enoki mushrooms, shiitake, black mushrooms, fish cake, meatballs, pork dumplings, spinach, some other greens, taro, lotus root, and a nice helping of dried rice noodles (I think).  So these things mixed to your liking, with the broth, are great by themselves. Really the broth can be eaten like a soup it is so good. But, they bring chili paste, chili oil, sesame paste, and a mixture. And that mixture is one of the best condiments I've ever tasted and goes perfectly with whatever you have in your bowl.

She didn't explain anything about how it worked to me...just dropped off the pot of broth and a plate with three different kinds of lettuce/cabbage, some noodles, I think it was jicama? And so many things I had no idea what they were! I just kind of threw it in and let it cook. She gave us bowls so we spooned the soup into them. The broth tasted like fishy water, not good at all. The ingredients all turned to a sort of mush. It was disgusting. Once we had given it a valiant effort, we gave up. About this time, every single employee in the restaurant sat down at a table in the dining room and served up a HUGE feast for themselves. James kept signaling for a check, she'd look right at him and ignore him. She even got up three times to refill her food. We watched them eat almost 20 minutes. Finally James got up and went over there. They were shocked. They dropped off the check and never came back. He went up to the front to pay and they told us to go back to our table and wait!\n\nWe finally were able to pay (which we shouldn't have had to) and leave.\n\nI am giving a one star rating for the service, which was reprehensible. \n\nOur waters had no ice, the sauces had a film over the top and crusty spoons/dishes with them. The food was unsavory and the menu was confusing. \n\nI will give their sushi two and half stars. We had the crazy dragon roll, and despite not having quite enough cream cheese in our opinion, it was very good. \n\nI am giving Soga the benefit of the doubt according to the rest of the reviews....maybe we caught them on a bad day.

I've been here twice; the first time, we had to wait up by the bar for 5 minutes before anyone would come out and let us pay our check.

For $6 on the menu, we were impressed with both their balance and their strength. When the bill arrived, we were surprised to see we had been charged $7 apiece. We asked the waitress about the price discrepancy; she apologized, and said their bartender was out for the evening, so they needed to go across the street to Osaka House to source the drinks. While we gladly would have approved had she notified us of this before we ordered, we were not happy to be charged more than we agreed. Plus, no effort was made to correct the error (just \"sorry, I should have told you - but that's what it costs\"). It wasn't the price that irked us; it was the fact that they didn't disclose what we would actually pay.\n\nBoth times we've eaten there, the employees have been on their phones, sitting in the dining room - ignoring customers.

Econte?\n\nWe started off with the tempura vegetables.  Oh, wow, were they good.  Broccoli, and sweet potatoes and zucchini, carrots and green beans---nice sized wedges with a perfect layer of light, crispy, ungreasy batter.  Our only caveat---the serving was WAY too much for two people!  We were only able to manage half the plate and leave room for our entrees.  I think maybe next time we'll see if they can do a half-size!  Because you definitely don't want to miss the entrees!  It's been a long time since we had good Thai, so that where DH and I went.  I was really tempted by the crab-fried rice, that was complimented by several Yelpers, but I decided to go with the red curry and I said to \"surprise me\" with the protein, which ended up being some lovely, tender, tasty chunks of pork swimming in a delicious, spicy, coconut-y broth.  Oh, mouth-bliss.  Just spicy enough to make my tastebuds sing, but not so much I got what I call \"hot-cupps\" (hiccups created by really spicy food!).  DH got the Panang Curry with Chicken and again, great quality chicken with a wonderful sauce and plentiful veggies.  We ate and ate and ate it was so good, but it's like our plates were bottomless!  We actually ended up having plenty to take home as leftovers, along with that tempura (which was still pretty good the next day, though sadly tempura really isn't great leftovers).  So a very reasonably priced meal was made even more so because we ate off it for two days!  \n\nI liked it, but DH thought the fish sauce was a bit heavy, but since it's obvious everything is made from scratch, I am sure we can easily ask they lighten that up a bit.\n\nAlas, I was way too chubbed out to try either of the desserts I was eyeing---the Fried Banana or the Lychee vs Black Sweet Sticky Rice----I was very intrigued by the latter---but I'll figure that out for the next visit.

They also serve it with prawns if you prefer which is equally delicious. Aidan went for one of their specials, which change weekly.

In part to avoid the throng of people flocking. It's a busy enough place at the best of times. \n\nAnd this location is no exception to this rule, and I introduced the SR to the Wagamama way. He was not sorry. We shared a vegetarian pad thai, grilled prawns and followed it up by apple and cinnamon gyoza. I'm not buying gyoza deep fried as a dessert. The dough doesn't like it, I tell ya. And what can I say, Wagamama's doesn't blow you away, but I've never been disappointed in the food.

This time at a restaurant just one demerit shy of shutdown.\n\nIt's only been open three months and was almost forced to close its doors.\n\nThe name sounds like a massage parlor, but it's actually a restaurant. Hot Feel on Spring Mountain welcomes customers with the wiggly legs of a giant craw fish, and a 40-demerit \"C\" grade, which worries the owner.\n\n\"Yup, your reputation is definitely at stake if you have a C grade posted,\" Darcy Spears said, talking on the phone to the owner, who had a unique reason for not appearing on camera.\n\n\"Your lips are swollen like a sausage? Why? Stress?\" asked Darcy. \"Your lips are swollen like sausages because of stress from the health inspection.\"\n\nDuring that health inspection, an employee handled dirty dishes then prepared food and drinks with no hand washing.\n\nFood was being stored in a freezer that was unplugged. Prepared food on skewers was sitting directly on top of a cardboard box. They had raw chicken and raw beef thawing together in standing water.\n\nThe owner said his employees weren't up to speed on health district regulations and the inspection was a wake-up call.\n\nInspectors found frozen crab legs thawing at room temperature, uncovered food, a dirty ice machine and Diet Coke syrup that had expired back in April.\n\nHand sinks were blocked and being used for storage. Dirty, greasy water was being used to wash dishes.\n\nThere were children and other unauthorized people in the kitchen. Employee drinks and a baby bottle were on prep surfaces next to food.\n\nHood filters were excessively dirty and greasy and so was the floor behind appliances.\n\nAs for their \"C\" grade, someone had covered it up behind things on the bar. The owner said all will be well by the time they're re-inspected and he has this message: Customers' health is the most important thing and he'll make sure that stays safe.\n\nWe have one imminent health hazard closure to talk about. The Smith's supermarket bakery on Rampart and Lake Mead was ordered to shut down because its only hand sink wasn't working.\n\nAnother one nearby wasn't draining and was filled with murky, dirty water.\n\nThe owner of Hot Feel said he's scheduled their re-inspection for Friday, June 20.", "review_stars": 1, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "So far so good (and spicy) so I'll definitely be back. It's a spacious restaurant. Staff is uber friendly. I didn't catch his name but he was a pretty cool server.\n\nFirst off, we got the hotpot combo. You get 4 items at 5 pieces each and it soaks in the hotpot broth. There's no mild for this so we got the second option in terms of spice levels (3 total). He says it doesn't soak up the spice much in a short time span, but the tofu SOAKS it up well. So, beware, if you can't take much spice like me.\n\nAside from that we only got the lamb skewers. I'll be back for other stuff. Now, for the lamb skewers, we got mild, because frankly, I don't want to die burning.\n\nSo, guess what? I died burning. It was soooooooooooooooo spicy!!!!!!! WHY?! Because they were trying a new spice or new manufacturer (or something of the like) and it was WAY too spicy. It wasn't just us. I believe the staff tried it as well as the table next to us. Yeah, it was death by the burning of my tongue and I was wishing for milk (of course, they didn't have it). BURN BURN BURN.\n\nAnyway, they gave us a new stock of lamb skewers. No spice ;).\n\nOwner came over and apologized and explained the situation. No biggie. He's a pretty nice guy. Explained their VIP cards, too. Right now it's $20 until the end of April. So, if you think you'll be coming often, grab one before the prices go up. It's pretty much where they offer different deals per day and each day offers a different item.\n\nFor example, you could get a BOGO (for example, BOGO crab) one day. You could get 10% off the whole bill. And so forth.

Been wanting to try it since i first heard about it. \n\nSUPER easy to spot at night. If you are coming in from Spring Mountain, its the huge brightly lit Shrimp at the end of the plaza. XD \n\nDecor - very interesting, unique design. they have particular tastes, that may be quite different from others XD \n\nAfter hearing about their hot pot combo AND their skewers... THATS GOTTA BE what we will try ! \n\nLamb Sticks - $5.95 for 8 skewers - We tried the spicy and the medium. Spicy was first. Meat was kind of small. Flavor wise, DELICIOUS ! Spicy and flavorful. Cumin, pepper, and i believe lemon grass as well? Yummy ! Priced good too ! Medium level was actually a bit disappointing. It was quite the huge gap in spice level between medium and spicy. You can call the spicy, on a scale of 1-10, maybe an 8. Medium, 3-4. It wasn't spicy. It was actually sweet to me. Doriee had called it teriyaki lamb. XD \n\nBeef Sticks - $4.95 for 8 skewers - Spicy level as well. Same seasoning as the lamb skewers. Was a little awkward because usually the cumin spice is used for lamb. Was still good. Spicy like the spicy lamb too. Meat amount was more than then lamb. \n\nHot Pot Combo - $11.95 for 20 sticks with up to 4 different items - We had ordered shrimp, fried tofu, king oyster mushroom, and beef tendon balls. \n\nShrimp - Cooked perfectly. Kind of flavorless. Some people had called this place the sichuan hot n juicy. No where near it. None of the sauce stuck. Even peeling the shell and dipping back into sauce didnt help. The Hot Pot \"soup\" is too thin for that application. \n\nKing Oyster Mushroom - Good texture as this mushroom known to be. Slides OFF the skewer very easily... so you'll have to go caveman spear pokin for it later or just use two skewers and go chopsticks style. \n\nBeef Tendon Balls - Cut into maybe 1/8 slivers ? Holds the soup flavor pretty well. Seemed to have nicely absorbed into the slivers. \n\nFried Tofu - Lol. I had called this \"the item to screw thy self with\"... Fried tofu tends to be VERY porous and is KNOWN to soak up ANYTHING you put it in thats liquid. Spicy hot pot soup and a sponge of a tofu? Yep... XD Holds a LOT of soup in each piece. Tends to dribble down your chin too so be CAREFUL to not get it on yourself and be VERY careful cuz it will \"explode\" when you bite into it :P \n\nOverall, the lamb skewers were delicious. Beef was ok. Hot pot combo, im pretty sure the soup base is the same one i use for hot pot at home ... Lol flavor was VERY VERY similar...

The standouts were the Garlic Shrimp(head on, shell on) which was packed with tons of flavor with the right amount of heat(we asked for mild). The Lamb Skewers were also soft and flavorful.

Finding it wasn't so hard cause there was a giant shrimp on the building but once I walked in, I was wondering if this is supposed to be American/Creole or Asian. The establishment was very spacious and the decorations are VERY modern. You know that feeling when you walk into a restaurant that's supposed to be Asian but doesn't look Asian, you get a little skeptical ....\n\nBut what the heck, they had lamb skewers, or \"lamb sticks\" as they called it. I've been trying to find a good place that had lamb skewers for ages!\n\nSo, as a group, we ordered the hot pot stick in spicy, lamb skewers in med and spicy, and beef skewers in spicy. \n\nFor the hot pot sticks, it came in a pitcher of hot pot soup with skewers. You got to choose 4 from the menu and we chose shrimp, beef tendon balls, fried tofu, and king oyster mushroom. The hot pot soup base was pretty much mala broth. It wasn't spicy, per say, it was just hot ... as in temperature hot. In the end, this dish was average. It wasn't anything special. Can I just order the king oyster mushrooms on its own?! \n\nThe lamb skewers were very good but the flavor difference between medium spicy and spicy is huge. The medium spicy lamb skewers tasted sweet while the spicy ones were spicy. The medium spicy ones are a no go. I LOVED the spicy ones. They were DELICIOUS. They were exactly the type of lamb skewers I look for. Wonderfully seasoned with cumin and spicy flavor. The only thing was ... the pieces of meat were quite small. It would probably be better if the pieces were bigger and less well done. Oh and eat them while they're still hot because once it gets cold, it doesn't taste as good anymore.\n\nThe beef skewers on the other hand are a no go. I don't think beef and cumin are a good combination. Then again, maybe I'm just biased? I just like lamb better than beef when it comes to cumin and spicy seasoning. \n\nOverall.

Frankly, there was 25+ minute wait at the Boiling Crab, so we hit the Yelp app, saw some decent reviews on this place, and went to try it for ourselves.\n\nStarted with the lamb and chicken skewers. A few of the lamb skewers were served medium-rare, just in case you care about meat temps. Chicken was white meat, good quality and perfectly grilled. But, both the lamb and chicken were over-sprinkled with their signature orange seasoning salt. My first impression was, \"Salty!\" Got the grilled corn-on-the-cob and it also had the exact same seasoning salt on it, and too much of it for my taste. If I could order these things again, I would order them with 'less salt' as they really were doused with the stuff. For $5, you do get a generous number of skewers (8 per order I believe) so that is kind of cool.\n\nGot the pot of cajun-inspired peel-n-eat, head-on shrimp. Garlic style, extra spicy. The 'extra spicy' spice level was a solid *hot*. But, the chili pepper flakes were the crushed, and not ground variety, which made the texture of the pot sauce not very fun to eat. Strangely gritty, actually. Like chewing on small, tough bits of bay leaves. This affected the in-pot corn cobs as well. I did love the chopped bits of garlic in the sauce, and I wish there were even more garlic in it as I ran out of garlic bits by the 10th or 11th shrimp.\n\nThe head-on shrimps themselves were large, and the *exact* shrimp count was 16 in my one pound order. Pretty standard. (Boiling Crab sometimes gives you 17 or 18 by accident; Hot & Juicy 16-17 but 5 of them are usually headless or total runts; District One only gives you 14.) Four of the Hot Feel shrimp were on the borderline mushy side - a pet peeve of mine when it comes to this dish. Hot & Juicy is the worst when it comes to this. I always end up enacting the cajun shrimp exchange program at Hot & Juicy when I show them the mushy ones.\n\nAnyways - I did have a very slight allergic reaction to the Hot Feel shrimp about 30 minutes after dinner. Not a biggie, but worth noting. That does not happen when I eat the shrimp from the aforementioned competitors (even the sketchy Hot & Juicy).\n\nSuper nice staff, and pleasant environment. They've got TVs with 4 different sports channels which is cool. Potential - yes. Would I go back? Maybe. A *huge* difference between this place and say, Boiling Crab, is the good variety of things to eat aside from the pot-o-cajun seafood.

I liked the presentation. It also came with a salad. I love salad so this makes me happy to see. The curry chicken was very fresh and generous so I will forgive that is needed a bit more curry flavour. I was satisfied just the same. They include a very lightly fried egg or spring roll, quite tasty. The only odd thing I found and I have no idea if it was intentional, the dipping sauce in the center of the box was refrigerator cold. Not objectionable, just odd.\n\nOften times when one is the only patron the service is lacking, not here. I was well taken care of by a friendly lady.\n\nAs I was getting ready to leave I stopped in the restroom.

Plenty of good reviews so we called to make sure we'd be able to be seated without much wait.  The lady that answered said no worries.  Great for 8:00 PM on Valentine's Day!\n\nWe arrive and the first thing I notice is the decorations and lighting.  Everything looks very welcoming and modern.  The lighting is perfect and the layout is very inviting.  We seat ourselves at a booth and notice there are 6 other tables that are seated.  \n\nWe wait...  Then we wait some more...  Finally, a young girl comes and brings us each a menu and a sheet showing the Valentine's Day special.  We look at the menu and both agree that the Crab Rangoon's look like a delicious appetizer.  I decide I'll have the General Tso's Chicken and my girlfriend is in the mood for the Curry Chicken.  Both items have a small chili icon indicating extra spice.  Perfect as we both love spicy Thai food.\n\nWe wait some more.  The initial girl that brought us our menu after we waited when we first arrived hadn't taken a drink order from us or brought us water.  There were 4 servers/employees taking orders this night, mind you.  After a 10 minute wait, a young gentleman finally comes and asks us if anyone has taken our order yet.  I tell him no and he apologizes and takes our order.  He asks if my girlfriend would like white or brown rice with her dish.  Mine comes with white rice by default.  Our drinks arrive fairly quickly along with our Crab Rangoons.\n\nThe Rangoons are amazing.  The creme cheese and the crab melt in our mouths and the sweet and sour sauce is perfect in consistency and sweetness.  It even includes a tasty side salad on the plate with a peanut sauce lightly over top.  The breading is light and crispy.  Some of the better Crab Rangoons we've had.  I wipe my hands after finishing the appetizers with the only small drink napkin they brought us.\n\nMy plate arrives.  The chicken looks delicious.  The sauce looks perfect and the breading looks awesome.  My white rice comes as well.  My girlfriend waits another 3 or 4 minutes for her plate to arrive.  I wait for hers to arrive as well.  When it comes, the curry looks and smells extra flavorful.  She waits for her brown rice.\n\nI decide to try some of my chicken and rice.  I give my girlfriend a bite as well.  The sauce is good but not spicy.  The breading is great.  The chicken is poor quality.  Nearly every other bite has chicken that is very fatty or what I like to call \"full of tendons\".  I eat one bite and end up politely spitting my next bite into my napkin.  I flag down a server and tell him that her brown rice hasn't arrived yet.  He tells me \"I think we are out of brown rice.  Let me go check.\"  Nobody told us they were out before when we ordered the curry chicken nor did they tell us they didn't have any when they brought her dish.  They must have conveniently forgot.\n\nHe comes right back and confirms they are out of brown rice.  No apology.  No asking if she's like white rice as a substitute.  I share my white rice with my girlfriend.  I eat half of my dish as the majority of my chicken is large clusters of meat that are fatty and/or chewy.  The curry chicken my girlfriend ordered is thinly cut and good quality meat.  I eat several bites.  Not spicy.  The entire time we eat our dinner, the several servers that are working approach the 6 tables on rare occasion.  We are never approached once to ask how we're enjoying our meal.  If we'd like a refill.  Nothing.\n\nI leave my half plate on the table and my girlfriend leaves what she can't eat on her plate.  We sit, talk and enjoy each others company.  We've set our plates towards the end of the table and made it obviously clear to anyone that we are ready for our check.  We make a point to see how long it takes before someone comes and ask if we'd like a box and ask if we are ready for our check.  After 15 minutes, a lady approaches us and asks if we'd like a box.  I say \"Yes please\" politely.  She takes our food and boxes it and comes back with our check.  I notice we've been charged for the brown rice that they were out of.  I bring the check up to the front and point out the mistake.  No apology.  \"That's right.  We didn't have any brown rice.\"\n\nShe fixes the check and comes back to our table shortly after.  When she lays down the check, she starts taking the remaining items off of our table.  Never any acknowledgment towards us.  Never any questions about our dinner.  Nothing.  A young girl runs to our table and brings us a complimentary rose as it's Valentine's Day (this wasn't unique to us as they gave a rose to every table when they were finished).  \n\nThe service was terrible and my chicken was made from low quality parts it seemed.  If it was busy and they weren't properly staffed, I would have gladly understood the lack of service.  There was no excuse on this night.

I'm trying not to be jaded and I'm trying to remember that we're rating restaurants based on what's HERE and not what I've had throughout my travels.  However, while the food here does seem to be good, I'm not \"wowed\" by it.\n\nTo be fair, we did not have an entree:  after working out, we came in for some Hot n Sour soup and the Pu Pu Platter and figured, if we're still hungry after that, we can order more.  The Hot n Sour soup was far from being watery and was quite tasty, but, again, I just wasn't floored by it.  When they bring the soup to you, it doesn't look like it's much, because the bowl they bring it in looks deceptively small.  The soup is ladled out into small, art-deco-like bowls (more on the decorating later) and you'll get about 4 servings out of it.  My other half found the soup spicy; I did, too; but only because I added chili paste to it even before I tasted it  (I know from experience, that no matter what a server tells me, it's NEVER spicy enough for me).  The Pu Pu platter was generous in its portion size, though the egg rolls are a little too greasy and filled only with cabbage (not a problem for me) and the meat on the skewer rather tough (again, I didn't have a problem with that, but they might consider serving a knife with it).  Those two items with a diet Coke for me came to $18+ including tax ... very much a good deal considering portions and taste.\n\nNow, the decor:  unlike many of the restaurants in the Valley -- and especially in strip malls, which this place is part of -- with their fluorescent lighting and tacky flaky ceiling tiles having about as much character as a Tea Party candidate promising not to disrupt proceedings on the floor of the House, this restaurant's owners made obvious efforts to decorate this place.  The restaurant is immaculately clean to the point of sterile; decorations are somewhat eclectic, but in good taste and well-coordinated.  So what possible complaint could I have? (Apparently, you haven't been reading my reviews, if you're seriously asking).\n\nAs tasteful and classy as the decorating in this place is, I don't find it necessarily appetite-inducing (though it doesn't ruin your appetite either):  the scheme is mainly grey and black, so that your first thought might be \"intimate and quiet\".  The basic art deco design of the room and this intimate color scheme almost makes me feel like I'm in a classy gay bar in NYC, where you'd see older gentlemen and, maybe, their younger companions.  The only things missing were, in the following order ...\n\na)  a piano\nb) candles on the tables\nc) a pencil-thin waiter, slightly effeminate, in white shirt and black tie, checking on your meal\n\nNow, bear in mind, I don't say this with the intention of dissing this place or trying to sound negative.  At nighttime, it's an almost elegant and appealing atmosphere; but having come from New York and having dined in many such intimate restaurants, while I always felt cozy in them, I always felt like I had to watch my manners more than enjoy my meal.  \n\nThat said, the wait staff is attentive without making you feel like you've sat there too long; the portions are generous; the prices are reasonable; the place is \"I-wish-my-house-was-this-clean\" sterile and considering the location and the price-level, you could easily bring a first date to this place and not feel like the cheap bastard you obviously are for not spending more money to impress your date  (Don't worry ... you can always buy him or her an expensive present and tell them you preferred to spend the money on their gift rather than an overpriced meal).\n\nSo, yes ... I would say that, for the West Valley, this is a Chinese Restaurant a cut above almost all the rest and the atmosphere alone and outstanding service is worth the effort to come here.

I mean, even if you only spend one night in Vegas, this is where you should have dinner. And I should know: I went to two restaurants when I was there, and this one was better.\n\nIn all seriousness, though, Sensi was my first (yes, of two) introduction to the fancy restaurant scene in Vegas. I'd heard a lot about various famous chefs opening new restaurants here, but I figured rather than Nobu Next Door these places would be more like Nobu Up The Block And Around The Corner And Then Take Your Third Left After The Light. In short, I expected mediocre food at exorbitant prices. At Sensi, neither was the case. \n\nFirst of all, I for the most part do not care about decor. As long as I'm not knocking knees with another diner, I feel fine with a chair at a table. But this place is so cool. It's very modern and sleek but in a warm way, which is to say you don't get the feeling that your very presence might be ruining the otherwise super cool atmosphere. There's a lot of smooth gray rock all over the place, and water falling down it. It's clean and pleasant. \n\nAnd the food is delicious. We had a tuna three ways to start--raw, raw, raw--and it was unique and very tasty. I say \"unique\" because I have several times ordered tuna only to remember, Oh, right, I've had this a million times before. This one tasted like someone actually put some effort into it. We also had a calamari dish, not deep-fried but the sauteed kind, which is much more interesting to me, which came with this amazing lightly breaded cooked tomato. The combination of flavors was lovely and impressive in that it seemed creative but was not at all overpowering. \n\nSensi is some kind of fusion between Indian and Japanese and maybe a few other things. Typically the idea of fusion drives me nuts; when I have a PB&J sandwich for dinner with a side of leftover pad thai, I don't go around saying I just made myself a Thai-American fusion meal. But I think they do a pretty good job at Sensi of making everything well enough so that they earn the right to serve different kinds of foods. I guess we started with Japanese? Anyway, for entrees we chose two different kinds of curry, a red shrimp curry and a chicken tikka masala. The latter was sub-standard, by which I mean that it didn't taste as good as chicken tikka masala at my local Indian favorite. But the shrimp was great--and I don't even like shrimp that much! It was high quality (i.e. it actually tasted like something) and it came in this awesome little coconut bowl (real, I think), and the rice was delicious and we got naan bread that was, as good naan bread is, out of this world.\n\nI don't remember the desserts as being that great, but I'm pretty hard to please when it comes to desserts. If it's too sweet I don't like it, if there's orange flavor I don't like it, if there's chocolate mixed with cherry I don't like it.

My mama had the Tandoori mixed grill, which came with possibly the most amazing naan bread I've ever had, overflowing with sauteed red onions and topped with chili flakes.  Papa had some sort of steak, an option which literally provided him with a giant chunk of red meat and nothing else.  As I don't eat meat, I wasn't impressed, but he seemed to dig it.

Yeah, just lovely....\n\nAnyway, so we eventually made it to Sensi at 9:40, some 10 minutes after our reservations.   They couldn't seat us then & there, but they said it'd be about 20-30 minutes..... Fine, I thought, I'll order a stiff martini to calm the nerves after this brutal drive we just had... and we'll eventually be seated.  The bartender was slow and full of attitude, preferring to stare at the cute playboy bunnies who were looking at him lovingly instead of making my fucking martini.   Can't say I blame him, other than the fact that I wanted some liquid medicine... AND FAST!!!\n\nWe were eventually seated some 30 minutes later... We ordered 3 oyster shooters for appetizer and, as main course:  1 Roasted Salmon, 1 New York Steak, 1 Day Boat Scallop, and 1 Lamb Chop...   We ordered 2 side dishes alongside that:  mashed potatoes and deep fried asparagus.\n\nAs far as drinking was concerned, I wanted to order a nice bottle without freaking everybody out, so I ordered wine # 14437, which, as it turns out, was the Brunello Altesino and it was ripe to perfection... An absolutely perfect wine pairing.\n\nFood was way good, portions were generous, and the wine definitely complemented the food very well.   I ate the lamb chop and really enjoyed it.  The meat was so tender and fell right off the bone.   I tasted my wife's scallops and man-oh-man were they awesome too!  Served with a puree of English peas, it was a delightful dish.   My stepfather seemed to enjoy his steak, and my mother definitely enjoyed her salmon.\n\nService was wonderful... Shortly after we started our dinner, the sommelier came to let us know we had ordered the last bottle of 14437 but made several other recommendations.   Frankly, we had no intent to dig into another bottle, seeing as the first one was already $121, but still, it was very professional of him to come and let us know.

When we walked in, we passed a tank of tasty-looking lobsters, and once seated we had a view of the kitchen. Even the place settings add to the sleek, spa like decor. The colors of the dining room: muted and sophisticated.\n\nThe best part about this was that despite the sophisticated atmosphere, the service was friendly, efficient, and not the least bit snooty. The folks there were among the best wait staff I've encountered in Vegas. \n\nWe started with house cocktails. I can't remember the name of the drink I ordered, but it was strong with a full ginger flavor, and very good ($14, the cost of all the Bellagio specialty cocktails I encountered at the pool, Fontana, the Petrossian Bar, etc.). The server then brought a fantastic little bread plate with several varieties of homemade bread and accompanying chutneys. \n\nWe then ordered the tempura fried asparagus (which I chose after reading the reviews on Yelp) and it lived up the hype. Fantastic! I wish I had some right now. We ordered appetizers and sides for our main course: A fantastic fried lobster dish with mango and micro greens; Duck pot stickers with foie gras on the side; and the Sensi fried rice.

And boy does Sensi not disappoint.  \n\nSight:  Impeccable.  The restaurant is laid out in four different kitchens, plus a dessert kitchen and a bread bakery.  The decor is sleek and contemporary, with natural materials:  light colored woods, large pieces of hewn stone, sometimes rough and natural, sometimes polished smooth, with brushed metal accents and flowing water.  There were many different dining rooms as well, with 6 or so tables in each, so it feels intimate no matter where you are.  The staff is well-dressed and groomed, with clean, simple uniforms.  The plates were all unique, and \n\nTouch:  The seats were comfortable and the table was smooth and nice to touch, while the appetizer plates had an interesting texture.  The cool soft water of the vanishing edge fountains was nice, and was clearly either distilled or at least purified with salt (otherwise I suppose the fountains would get silty).  Along with the glass and the polished stone, very nice texture-wise.  (Though no one goes to restaurants to feel on things.  Oh well.)\n\nSmell:  Tantalizing.  The first brush is the Indian tandoori, with hints of curry.  The smell of the fresh bread was exquisite as well, and being seated next to the bread bakery was a plus in that department.  The light salt scent of fresh seafood was there, as well as garlicy and buttery hints, though I'm not sure from where, exactly.\n\nSound:  I can't say that it was the most amazing place with sound.  You hear the typical restaurant sounds of plates and the shuffling feet of wait-staff.  There was either no music, or it was too light to be heard, though the sound of running water was nice.  We talked throughout, as well, so I suppose that that wasn't too big a deal.  It was *not* loud and echo-y, though, as you might expect from the stone and glass used.  I'm guessing the wood in the ceiling and floor helped to damp it, but I'm not sure.\n\nTaste:  I'm sorry while I tear up a little.  The food was very good.  Very good indeed.  We started with cocktails (didn't feel like wine that night, and I wasn't sure what I was ordering yet), but it was the perfect mix of citrus and rum, and I really enjoyed it.   We were given slices of at least 3 or 4 kinds of bread, freshly baked and sliced right behind us, with butter and a chive spread.  It was great.  Next, we ordered Tuna 3-ways, and the Thai Lobster and Shrimp rolls, and they were very good.  The fish was fresh, and had a unique flavor that one could dream about.  The rolls were good as well, but I think a little more cilantro could've helped it along to perfection.  We had a bit of everything.  Lamb, Scallops, Steak, and Lobster (the four of us with one each), and usually you don't share at a fine dining restaurant, but the food was too good not to sample some of everyone's plate. The lamb was in a light and flakey pastry with just the right done-ness, the scallops had the most rich and subtle lightly buttered taste, the lobster was served Indian style, and the steak was rich and full, and the largest thing served there.  I had the tapioca pudding for dessert, and it really is THE BEST as they advertise, the creme brulee was to die for, especially the unique pistachio, and I can't recall was it was called, but the chocolate log was great, and I'm not usually much for chocolate.  Nothing I didn't like at all from Sensi.  When we left, we were given a small box of cookies, a nice touch, and each was very good.\n\nService (the Sixth Sense):  We were seated almost immediately for our reservation.  The hostess was gracious, addressed the party by name, and slowly walked us through the restaurant to our seat.  The table setting had everything, each person having a bread plate, a water glass, a wine glass, two forks, and a knife.   The wine menu is expansive and much larger than the food menu, with all ranges of pricing (none cheap, though).  The hostess let us sit down, and the three adults put their napkins in their laps, and the hostess put the napkin in the child's lap herself.  \nThe waiter came by, introduced himself, and offered us choice of water, and promptly took the wine glass from the minor's place setting.  Since we'd informed him of a birthday in the party, that person was served first, and then the waiter would move completely across the table to the lady second (it was clear she'd be first if it wasn't for the birthday celebrant).  All the little touches were there, with the glasses removed or refilled as needed, and when two in the party got up to go to the restroom, leaving their napkins on the chairs, the napkins were quickly removed, and new, folded napkins were left near the place setting.  The steak was not finished during the meal, so it was boxed up in a container, and placed in a stylish carrying back with Sensi on the front.

A meticulous planner, my dinner reservations going into Vegas were mapped out months in advance and my breakfast details planned out extensively.  While my lunches were unscheduled, I generally knew where I wanted to go and generally went there.  When my best friend decided at the last minute that Enoteca San Marco wasn't something he was interested in and suggested \"something asian maybe\" I remembered hearing good things about Sensi and turned to it as an alternative since my buddy had been so agreeable to places like MiX and Alex which weren't really his \"scene.\"  Tucked in the back of Bellagio and pretty tough to find, unfortunately Sensi wasn't tough enough to find.\n\nSeated immediately near the admittedly awesome bread prep station, our 'waiter' Jeremy W briefly asked \"sparkling or flat\" and my friend stated flat.  We were brought an already opened bottle of Fiji and two glasses of ice.  When I suggested tap water would be fine, the 'waiter' stated \"Well, the bottle is already opened.\"  The bottle cost $8 and was not comped despite our not wanting it.  Approximately ten minutes later menus were brought and essentially dropped off without explanation.  The waiter then returned approximately 10 minutes later with some Naan to go with our empty condiments (every other table was served fresh soy, salt, mustard, and tomato pepper chutney with their Naan...I had to stand up and get my own.  Orders were taken and this was the last we'd see of Jeremy until he delivered the bill.\n\nBrowsing the restaurant I must admit the d\u00e9cor was beautiful and watching the chef prepare the Naan was interesting.  After one basket of the delightful and doughy yet crisp bread topped with spicy chutney a non-descript server arrived and removed our basket, later returning with fresh bread.  This was the best service we received at Sensi.  \n\nAfter around 20 minutes our mains arrived, myself ordering Oven Roasted Diver Scallops with Basil Risotto, Zucchini, and Eggplant and my friend opting for the Shrimp and Beef with Duck Fried Rice.  All things being equal, the food was decent but certainly no better than I've had at far cheaper restaurants with vastly better service.  My scallops were a tad overdone but certainly fresh and tasty while the Risotto was soft yet consistent and contrasted well with the vegetables.  My friend additionally noted his dish was \"pretty good.\"  Portion sizes were adequate but certainly not excessive considering the $20+ pricetags.\n\nAnother 15-20 minutes passed after the meal and thankfully I was seated close to the server's station where I was capable of filling my own glass with tap water because during that time no on arrived at our table.  Eventually Jeremy reappeared and without asking about dessert or anything else he delivered the check and collected our dishes.  \"Have a great day\" he said.  To be fair, it wouldn't have taken much to be a great day after such a disappointing meal with such lousy service.  The total bill was $56.03 and our most affordable meal of the trip.  No tip was left as no tip was deserved...I've had better service at Denny's.  \n\nThe only plus of the meal was that on the way back to the sportsbook and gaming floor we had to pass by the beautiful Bellagio gardens and Jean-Philippe where I ordered the best Tiramisu I've ever had.

It's a treat for sure, but it's a reasonable treat. To be honest, ordering a la carte here would give me pause; it's a whole different price point.\n\nWe started with a basket of naan and pappadums, which the server felt compelled to explain. The naan was amazing, and you can watch a chef in the glass-enclosed kitchen making it all evening. This is accompanied by four sauces; the tomato chutney is by far the best, although a semi-spicy sweet chili dip is yummy too.\n\nHusband's crunchy shrimp app was light and flavorful and beautifully presented. I had a bite (for research purposes) and moved on to my market salad, which was a nice combo of greens, excellent parmesan, candied pecans in an unobtrusive vinaigrette. And, holy Gruner Veltliner, Batman--that wine pairing was perfect.\n\nMains: Husband had the flatiron steak, which he praised, along with the pickled onions and \"tater tots.\" My curried chicken came with basmati and raita; the buttery sauce was so good that I surreptitiously dropped bits of naan into the bowl to soak up more. Again, the wine, a shiraz blend with a goofy name, scored big flavor points.\n\nFor dessert, we both went for the chocolate thingy that's basically the best Kit-Kat bar you'll ever eat. It came with a scoop of ice cream that was not particularly flavorful, but who cares? The port that accompanied this course did all the heavy lifting.\n\nThe service is a bit old-school (i.e. napkins placed in laps, wine lists presented to the gentlemen), but not stuffy at all. I think they have to deal with a lot of tourists who are in over their heads, but they do so graciously. The waiter beamed at our praise, as if he was dying to run into the kitchen and convey the news.\n\nThe surroundings are, in a word, gorgeous. The other high-end restaurants at the Bellagio look formal, even a bit overdone and self-conscious. Sensi looks rugged and natural, minimalist but not cold.

Some dishes were serious knock-outs and some were not much better than my time at the blackjack tables.\n\nWTF is so good about the famous ginger ale? It was way too sour -- it tasted like unsweetened lemonade with a heavy dose of ground ginger. Maybe that's how the Italians like it, but I couldn't finish it.\n\nWe had several dishes from the prix fixe menu. The naan was good, but it was burnt (yes, literally, black char marks) and kind of unspecial. The cucumber, tomato-jalape\u00f1o and sweet chutneys were tasty. The crispy shrimp tasted disappointingly like any other fried food and the flat iron steak was both unremarkable and inconsistently cooked. But, the chicken in creamy butter curry sauce kicked some serious ass... order it (especially if you like chicken tikka masala)! Beware the wine pairings -- they were good pairs, but by my math it would have been cheaper to order 3oz pours of each pairing rather than go with the prix fixe pricing.\n\nGotta give a special WTF to the tater tots.

Bread service consists of papadums and handmade naan out of a two real clay ovens installed in the kitchens.

The market salad was equally pleasurable with the hint of bitterness of the lettuces and acidity from the citrus. Very well balanced dishes.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the grilled marinated skirtsteak (right amount of char) and nicely spiced accompanying green papaya salad. The green papaya was shaved so delicately, it looked like glass noodles. Wonderful flavour and textures. The butter chicken was nice along with the rice but it wasn't extraordinary.\n\nDessert was okay but not exceptional. The chocolate temptation dessert was overly sweet while the caramel ice cream had a very heavy burnt sugar flavouring to it. The tapioca pudding was rather flavourless when paired with that wonderful mango lassi and coconut ice cream.\n\nValue wise, you can likely find each individual components for less else where (I'm sure you can get a decent butter chicken or green papaya salad for less than $50/person).

It was pretty good and definitely different from the other beef carpaccios that I've had before. One of my friends ordered the prix fixe menu which came with the crispy shrimp ( Rice Flake Crust, Calamansi Mayonnaise, Buddah Hand Citrus) for appetizer. We all got to try some and it reminded us of Captain Crunch cereal with a nice citrusy flavor which I liked.

The perfect opportunity came up when my BF's bday arrived.  Not really knowing how busy this place gets, I made reservations two weeks in advance for a Thursday night. I let the receptionist know that I am celebrating my BF's bday and that we're first time diners.\n\nFast forward to my baby's birthday..\nI'm driving to the strip and my BF has no idea where i'm taking him for his surprise bday dinner.  I pull into the Bellagio and we start walking towards Sensi.  He is ecstatic and happy as hell because he's been bugging me to go to this restaurant for the longest time.  I approach the hostess and checked in for our 8:00pm reservation.  We were seated promptly along a narrow walkway at a big round table set for four.  This table was placed in a very awkward area and I wasn't comfortable there.  Also, because it was just my BF and I who were having dinner I don't understand why the hostess would seat us at such a big table.  I immediately asked if we can be moved to a different one and she quickly blurted out that there were no other tables and walked away.  I called over a man in a suit and asked him if he could please move us to a more suitable table set for two away from the narrow walk way; he gladly obliged.\n\nOn to dinner.  We were greeted briefly by our waiter (forgot his name) and was asked what we would like to drink.  He left after and came back asking us if we were ready to order.  it was our first time here, mind you, and had no idea what this restaurant was about.  Luckily, I took it upon myself and briefly browsed some yelps and learned that they offered a prefix menu.  For some reason the waiter didn't feel the need to explain the concept of the restaurant or offer us the tasting menu.  I asked about it, he pointed it out, and then he walked away.  My BF and i decided to give the menu a try so that we could get a pretty good selection.  We let the waiter know our choices and asked if we could decide on dessert after dinner.  He took the menus and walked away.  That was the extent of the service we received from him.  This other guy, who was such a sweetheart, tended to us, checked up on us, filled our waters, changed our plates, gave us bread, etc.  When dinner was over our waiter didn't even offer us dessert.  I overheard him asking the same guy who's been taking care of us to present us with the menu.  At this point i was extremely agitated because I noticed our waiter taking care of his other tables with great care and attentiveness.  I can't imagine why he chose to neglect us; It wasn't  a super busy night and his section was manageable. \n\nAnyway, I passed on desert (even though it was a part of our meals) because this waiter ruined my night.  He brought out a complimentary birthday desert anyway for my BF.  I tipped him a little less than 15%, although i really felt he deserved a big fat 0!!! Then I side tipped the server assistant some cash, since he's the one who took care of us.\nI was on my way out when the same man who moved us earlier asked how our dinner went.

I had the chicken curry and i've had better.  My BF had the halibut.  It lacked flavor, needed more salt, and was overcooked.

Score!  We were there...\n\nWhen we got there, the person I had made the reservation with had communicated to our server that I was vegan.  He acknowledged it right off the bat and directed the non-vegan specials to my husband.  Then he told me about the vegan risotto AND how they could swap out the scallops with tofu in the Thai scallops entree.  He then walked me through suggestions on how they could veganize other dishes -- plus, he noted which breads and sauces on the table were vegan.  Talk about going WAY above and beyond.

Not here -- this server, whose name I regret I didn't get so can't mention in this post - went above and beyond to help create a path for me so my experience was as luxurious and enjoyable as those looking at the full menu.\n\nIn the end, I had the farmer's salad (delish) and the Thai scallops, swapped out with tofu and it was out of this world.  Those, combined with the wine (they had a very nice wine selection) and great view in to their glass-enclosed fishbowl style kitchen, made for a really, really enjoyable evening.\n\nWe would have gotten dessert there if my husband didn't have his heart and eyes on a sweet crepe from the Jean Philippe Patisserie.  :)\n\nI highly recommend Sensi to anyone looking for an incredible meal and experience out in Vegas.  The restaurant is physically removed from the casino area so you really feel like you are getting away from the Vegas chaos for a bit.  This place isn't like many of the pretentious celebrity-chef restaurants either.  It's just hands down incredible food, service, and environment.  When we're back in Vegas, we'll definitely go back.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Scene: 02/18/11; at the Bellagio's Sensi Restaurant; Cascading waterfalls and exposed exotic stone walls with bamboo accents -- all grey and soothing and tranquil. Me and Mara G. walk in. Chef Martin Hierling, Executive Chef, just happens to be standing at the hostess stand with the hostesses. Mara G. remembered him from the Grand Opening -- SIX YEARS AGO. They strike up a brief conversation involving a lot of thoughtful agreement, whispering, nodding, and gesturing with foreheads towards me. We are seated with a full-view of half the open kitchen. Dining ensues.\n\nFlavio, our primary server, is super nice. Super nice. We order. Me: Pacific Pear cocktail. TLC roll. Scallops. The cocktail was at once gingery, sweet with Poire William, and a tad bit tart from the sour (house made, I'm sure) and necessary to temper the Vodka. Super yum delicious. I could have easily downed 3 or 4 of those babies. Remember, my blood alcohol is dangerously low. But I didn't. I had food to eat.\n\nWe finally figured out what the guy inside the glass enclosed kitchen center was doing. He was lifting naan out of the oven. A basket of it was delivered to our table. Lighter, fluffier naan, crispier flat breads, chunky chutney, cool creamy raita, and tangier tamarind sauce have never been produced on the planet. Why oh why, bread basket, do you exist? Don't you see my waistband straining as it is? You do realize I must eat you, don't you? \n\nMy TLC roll came out. If I say \"omg\" again, it will definitely lose its punch. But this tempura fried roll topped with lobster and crab (get it -- TLC) is definitely worth wearing out an overworked catch phrase of the 2K11. Oh My God! This creation was so good. The splashes of sriracha mayo and creamy wasabi were the perfect accents. I hate to say it, but I love saying it: I cleaned my plate! I probably shouldn't have, with multiple courses coming, but I couldn't help it. So good!\n\nFor the next course, I was expecting my scallops. All of a sudden, here comes Flavio with soup spoons. A treat from the chef! Wow! Thai coconut shrimp soup! In a hollowed out coconut bowl displayed on inedible salt on some kind of seashell. Wow! Can I just say this soup is more delicious by leaps and bounds than any Thai coconut soup I have heretofore experienced? Sweet, yet hot from the chili oil. Chock full of shrimp and enoki mushrooms. A little cilantro to top things off. This soup was the dancing water fountain light show in my mouth. (It is quite a stretch, but I am going to have to list this soup in my \"Crab Soup\" list for now until I rename it to seafood soups.) Thank you Chef!\n\nThen the scallops... These diver scallops could have doubled as hubcaps on my great grandfather's 57 Chevy. So huge! Yet so tender and flavorful; and no muscle. Gently seared scallops with sweet soy, sugar snaps, spinach, shallots, and enoki mushrooms, daikon radish, and perfectly steamed white rice (just for yucks)! :)\n\nBy now, I am stuffed to the gills. Mara G.'d ordered the tasting menu and had a dessert coming. But I was actually hoping to have time to sit back and savor the last few sips of my OR Riesling. Not.\n\nHere comes Flavio again with an ice sculpture shaped like a balloon with three ice cream scoops inside. A lit candle is in one of the scoops -- INSIDE the ice sculpture. Wow! What a feat of engineering. I blew it out and dove into salted caramel, espresso, and Madagascar vanilla ice cream scoops! (Misty, I was thanking MY lucky stars that all of the servers in house didn't come by beating a huge marching band bass drum and blowing \"new year's eve\" horns singing happy birthday like they did at Farrell's Ice Cream when I was 9 or 10.)\n\nThis ice cream was creating a similar experience for my taste buds, though. I have been in love with salted caramel since my visit to Sorella in NYC (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sorella-new-york#hrid:ovqOWowSYIQh4dxm_btJeQ) and I haven't been able to make it to Georgetown Cupcake in DC on Saturdays to get one of their salted caramel happy pills. But this scoop of salted caramel ice cream (along with the other flavors) hit the SPOT! Smooth, sweet, creamy, visually appealing, sexy even. Thank you Chef Martin! Thank you. Wow!\n\nBy 2/21, when the fullness subsided a bit, I was thinking of the pacific pear and the scallops. I will definitely return. Again and again. I loved this birthday dining taste sensation experience.

The shrimp were a bit too sweet for my taste, but the wife gobbled them up. The TLC roll was very delicious, and an interesting twist on a sushi roll. It's a spendy treat, however, since after tax/tip you're looking at about 28 bucks a plate, containing 4 bite-sized appetizers. Those good with math will spot the 7-dollars-a-bite price.

I made reservations a few months in advance, since the Virtuoso Conference was taking place at Bellagio this week, and the restaurant closes for renovations next week.  Sporting my new necklace, aptly named the Showstopper, Eric R. escorted me to the beautiful Sensi restaurant.  We had Chef Ellamar's food before at a Project Dinner Table a few years ago, but had never been in the restaurant.  I also knew before ever entering that this is one of the most beautiful restaurants in terms of design.  We were seated in a beautiful room at a table facing the glass kitchen - what a great view!\n\nImmediately, Sanae, the Head Sommelier, brought us Gruet champagne as a celebratory gesture for our anniversary.  We almost had visited Gruet winery in Albuquerque on Monday, but ran out of time!  I decided to go with the tasting menu, and Eric R. decided to go a la carte.  He ordered the Roll Call appetizer, with a sample of each sushi roll (trout, salmon, tuna, and lobster), and the halibut with corn risotto and charred tomato vinaigrette.  My selections on the tasting menu included the kusshi oyster with ponzu and sriracha, roasted octopus, the Thai diver scallop with jasmine rice and bok choy, kalbi marinated kobe flat iron steak with bone marrow and kimchi with mashed potato, and strawberry shortcake with basil.\n\nOur server (I believe his name is Lawrence) was great.  He promised to alternate my courses with Eric's so we could have food at all times and sample each other's.  First, we received the famous bread basket with naan, papadums, cucumber raita, and tomato chutney.  As I anticipated from Misti Y.'s and Bobby Y.'s reviews, we were addicted to the tomato chutney...and refilled the chutney and the basket!  Then, the chef generously sent out oysters for each of us though only I was supposed to get one.  The kusshi are small and flavorful and the sauce was perfect!  Who doesn't love ponzu?  So fresh!  Sanae helped us choose a wine for the meal.  We split a glass of white from Santorini Greece that she recommended, and it was flavorful and easy to drink.\n\nThen Eric received his roll call.  He let me try a bite of one with ikura but I wanted him to enjoy his appetizer, which he definitely did.  He loved the tuna roll.  Next, I received my roasted octopus, adorned with fried capers, roasted red pepper, roasted potatoes, and strands of radicchio.  I love grilled octopus and roasted did not disappoint.  The restaurant generously provided potstickers also, which Eric enjoyed.  Then I received my scallop, which had a chile paste flavor (which I love), delicious charred haricort vert, and bok choy with radish sprouts.  The scallop was HUGE and perfectly cooked.  Then, Eric received his halbut (perfectly cooked also) and it was delicious and moist.\n\nNext I got my steak which was presented beautifully and secretly pre-sliced which made my life easier!  It was very tasty.  We were so full so we got what was left to go, knowing dessert was next.  Besides my shortcake, the restaurant gave us three other treats: donuts, raspberry-rhubarb mousse, and a chocolate caramel dessert.  Wow!  We were so full.  Then our server gave us chocolates and told us the meal was taken care of already by someone else!  It turns out my parents arranged with Sensi to surprise us!

The other real good dish was the octopus salad - it had the softest, juiciest octopus pieces on a bed of greens and well seasoned roasted potatoes.  The small caper berries gave a nice acidic taste.\n\nThe main entrees were decent, but not at the current price point I think.  Miso glazed salmon was flavored well but slightly overcooked, and could have benefited with a side of white rice to balance out the richness.  This made us order a side of fried rice which wasn't too special.  The short rib and butternut squash ravioli was good and colorful, as was the tandoori butter chicken with basmati rice.

My family and I have now had three consecutive, flawless experiences at Sensi and this establishment has now worked its way into my top 5 favorite dinner options in Sin City. \n\nFirst of all, the setup of the restaurant is beautifully executed-- four different specialty kitchens (all open and just covered by glass) work together to create quite the memorable experience. On this last trip, we were right in front of the naan station. OH, THE NAAN. Standby for further gushing. (On a side note, I'm always a tad amused at the comparison of the kitchens to a zoo-- patrons at Sensi can just walk around the entire enclosure and watch the chefs at work. A very neat, transparent way to dine!)\nThe decor of the restaurant conveys a semi-upscale and classy ambiance without any stuffiness or pretentious vibes. Their drinks and desserts are all on display via iPad (nice technological touch). Our water glasses were always full and napkins were refolded upon every restroom break or chef-watching walk. \n\nNow, the food is really what continues to amaze me here. The table first starts off with a basket of naan (an Indian bread). I am the biggest sucker for naan, and this IS the best I have ever had. This last time, we were given three baskets, and I am pretty sure that I ate probably 80% of each basket...whoops. I was so full once my dish came out but I kept powering through. \nI repeat: THE BEST NAAN EVER. Sometimes, I think that Sensi is worth the visit for this alone. \n\nThe menu is split into four different categories/cuisines, so there is a lot to offer to even the pickiest diner. Some of our favorite dishes:\n \nAppetizers:\n\n+TLC Roll: Tempura Lobster and Crab sushi roll. There are only four total pieces, but they are excellent. Served with dabs of avocado whipped cream of sorts and some bite-y aioli. \n+Coconut and Shrimp Soup: If I could eat this soup every day for the rest of my life, and nothing else, I would live happily. A downright delicious coconut broth, slammed with different shoots of mushrooms, large shrimp, and a few tapioca balls (like those in Boba tea). Then, this smorgasbord is put into a fresh young coconut. MMMMM\nNOTE: (-)Crispy shrimp: We tried this app, but these were actually a disappointment. Way too crunchy and the only dish we haven't liked here. \n\nMain:\n\n+Sensi Noodles: The Sensi Noodles are amazing and is a fitting Asian dish to complement any other non-Asian dishes you may order. Served lo mein style with several prawns and a perfect balance of flavors with the noodles. \n+Butternut Squash Ravioli: Talk about a tasting overload! I cannot recall having a dish where so many flavors have been incorporated so effectively yet not taking away from the dish; I have a tough time explaining the dish as there were so many different elements and components making up everything besides the raviolis. Mushrooms, a few purple potatoes, spaghetti squash, etc... all basking in the perfect amount of flavorful cream sauce...I don't know what else I can say to do this dish justice! \n+My dad got the rib-eye on our last experience and woooow, I did not expect this piece of meat to be THIS good. I'm typically not a big fan of rib-eye cuts due to the high fat content, but this one was just right. My dad's only advice was to get half of the normal amount of seasoning on the steak..he said it was a little too salty for him. Otherwise, this had the tenderness of a filet and was packed with flavor! Also, the kitchen cooked it to perfection (medium-rare-plus). \n\nDessert: \n+Sensi Ice Bubble: A legitimate ice sculpture bigger than my head, hollowed out and filled with three scoops of sorbet or gelato-- wonderful presentation and even more wonderful taste! I love the mango sorbet and pistachio gelato. \n+Coffee and Donuts: Six sugar-dusted beignet donuts served with a Bailey's frozen cappuccino of sorts. A nice cap on dinner! \n \nWe have had a waiter by the name of Laurence every time, and he is simply fantastic. He is a very vocal Englishman, but is exceedingly knowledgeable of the menu and one can easily see that he truly loves what he does each and every day. Request him for some high energy at your table! \n\nOverall, Sensi is a place I will continue to visit each time I'm in Vegas.

The four pieces I was given was more than enough for a good sized appetizer.\n\nEntr\u00e9e was the big disappointment of the meal.  I ordered the strip steak cooked medium and for $60 for one piece of meat, I would expect near perfection.

The lobster (think the one I had was a special of the day because it wasn't on the menu. This was in 2008 though) and any of the steaks =YUM! The portions aren't out of control big which gives you plenty of room to indulge in dessert. House made ginger ale is refreshing and a must for ginger ale fans. OH! The menu changes often.

I ordered the TLC Lobster Roll and Skuna Salmon as per the waiter's recommendation. \n\nThe TLC Roll had some great flavours going on but the rice was very undercooked to the point that is what hard to chew and very chalky. The filling was great but it was ultimately brought down by the rice. \n\nThe salmon was cooked to perfection and had a beautiful crisp on the top. The first few bites were delicious but the very simple flavour profile got repetitive halfway through and the sweetness I originally loved about the dish started to make me feel a bit nauseous. I wanted a \"wow\" dish and this was just a simple salmon that I can cook myself at home. So although pretty good it was a letdown.\n\nFor dessert I had the Chocolate Delight which was great.

Our waiter was completely rude and neglectful. I ordered the crispy shrimp appetizer in the beginning to start off my meal. No where on the menu did it mention that this dish would be spicy. NO WHERE. The dish came and had four shrimps and on the shrimp were ginger and a slice of pepper. Knowing that I can't eat spicy food, I took OFF the ginger and the pepper.  But sure enough, it was spicy. So spicy that I had to spit out the food! The waiter came back to ask us how we were doing and I said that I didn't like the appetizer and it was too spicy. The waiter then proceeded to tell me that I probably shouldn't have ate the ginger and pepper with it and that was probably what made it spicy. I told him I didn't and he looks at me, smirked and took the plate away. \n\n-our food. I ordered the butter chicken with rice and my fianc\u00e9 ordered the special of the night. A bone in steak.

Instead, pick your favorite of the following two:\n\n\"My Evening at Sensi\"\n\n    --- or ---\n\n\"Attack of the Insane Drunk Ladies\"\n\nNow that I have that squared away, onto the review!  \n\nI had reservations for 1 on Saturday night at Sensi at the Bellagio.  Since I was flying solo, I decided to sit at the bar, which was stylish and contemporary, with lots of granite and dark woods and a waterfall.  Unfortunately, in contrast to the other high-end restaurants in the Bellagio, Sensi doesn't have any walls or doors or other barriers separating the interior of the restaurant from the foot traffic and general pandemonium happening in the common areas -- so my hopes for a serene dinner were dashed before I even started eating.\n\nAfter ordering a Sauvignon blanc (excellent!) and noshing on the complementary breadbasket of naan and curry-flavored chips, I decided dinner would be the \"Taste of Sensi\" tasting menu.  Here's the rundown:\n\nAMUSE BOUCHE\nSalmon cracker with nori crisps, kaffir smoked salmon, and wasabi avocado.  Lovely presentation, but far too salty/briny for my taste.  Not enjoyable.\n\nCOURSE #1\nRoasted octopus with chorizo, fingerling potatoes, arugula salad, egg yolk, and squid ink aioli.  Similar to the amuse bouche, this dish was beautiful to look at, but all I could taste was salt.  I picked it at, but didn't finish it.\n\nCOURSE #2\nAlaskan halibut with fennel, sweet corn, broken rice, asparagus, and peas.  Hands down my favorite dish of the night.  The halibut was cooked to perfection, and I loved the texture of the intermingled broken rice, corn, and peas.\n\nCOURSE #3\n\"Tongue & Cheek\" -- braised veal cheeks, smoked Wagyu beef tongue, potato puree, and red wine reduction.  Great flavors and beautifully cooked meats, but I was a bit blind-sided by the enormous portion of very rich ingredients, which seemed out of place in a tasting menu sequence.  I guess I can't complain about too much of a good thing, right?\n\nDESSERT\nGreek yogurt panna cotta with honey gelee and blackberry coulis.  SIlky smooth but overwhelmingly sweet.  A few bites and the sugar rush became too much to handle.\n\nWhile the food was a mixed bag, the real \"highlight\" of the evening (if you can call it that) was being accosted by a pair of insane drunk ladies** (IDLs) who stumbled in from the casino, sat down next to me, GRABBED MY UTENSILS OUT OF MY HANDS, and helped themselves to my food.  Jeeeeeezus H. Christ!\n\nI begged and pleaded with the bartender to do something about the IDLs, but he shrugged and did a whole lot of nothing.  Eventually the IDLs got bored of me and moved on to greener pastures...but my appetite was mostly ruined at that point.  I was hoping the bartender could comp at least part of my meal that had been rendered inedible by the IDLs' creeper-germs, but he refused.  Instead, he poured me a free glass of Sauvignon blanc in a to-go cup, which was a nice gesture, but nowhere near enough to make up for a spoiled dinner.  Needless to say, I quickly paid my check and got the hell out of there.\n\nAnd thus ends my tale of Sensi -- possibly the strangest and randomest experience I've ever had as a solo diner in Vegas (or anywhere else).  \n\n-----\n\n**Footnote: I didn't call them ladies at the time.

The restaurant provides delicious Naan Bread and an amazing tomato chutney and yogurt for dipping and enjoyment before your meal.\n\nThe bar list is amazing with several delicious concoctions, especially good is the Mojito that's made with legit ingredients.\n\nThe wine list is unbelievably solid. First Growth Bordeaux, Burgandy, Italian, Spanish, and New World that would rival some of the best steak houses in the nation.\n\nThat said, the service really makes the experience. Our server Michael from Long Island has been with the restaurant since the Bellagio opened. A statement of longevity that speaks to not only the economic viability of the restaurant but also the quality of the experience from the standpoint of the staff.\n\nWhen you have a place that exemplify class, you tend to keep great people who genuinely do what they do because they believe in it.\n\nSensi has a legit sommelier and wine stewards. \n\nThe place is amazing, I can't say enough good things about it.

My first impression, by the automated response I received from Open Table was not great.  The message they send back asks that you please call the restaurant the day of the reservation to confirm.

We got to the restaurant and had to wait in line to check in for our reservation.         Once at the stand, I was given a buzzer and told that I needed to wait.  So, we waited 10 minutes.  There's good people-watching, but I'd rather be seated right away then wait when I have a reservation.  \n\nWhen the buzzer went off, we went back up to the desk and this time the man was overly kind, as many people in Vegas had been.  He thanked us profusely for waiting, told us that he really hoped we enjoyed our night, and the rest of our stay.  We were escorted to the perfect table on the second level over-looking the 3-story Asian figure sitting on a koi pond in front of a wall of candles.  It was gorgeous.  The waitress was really sweet and about 10 minutes in, we were seated with out menus closed and a manager came up and asked us if we were waiting on the waitress of if she was waiting on us.  We told him not to worry that we were relaxing.  He told us that if there was anything he could do to make our meal more enjoyable, we should let him know.  Again...so nice...totally unexpected. \n\n In typical fashion, I over ordered.  We had edamame (cold with shaved ginger and sesame seed in maybe sesame oil?)...they were okay, not great.  We also had tempura avocado (I'd never seen that before, and I don't generally like the taste of warm avocado...it wasn't different this time) and zucchini.  And...because I'm a hog and needed 3 appetizers, we ordered the garlic and lime stuffed shrimp, which I was looking forward to most of all.  They were probably the biggest disappointment.  The shrimp tasted like they'd been frozen, and they stuffing was, more than anything, breadcrumbs.  Hell, they weren't even stuffed...more like patted on top of the shrimp. \n\n For entrees we ordered the filet (B) and Thai seafood stew.  B thought his filet, was good...not as good as at Delmonico, but still good.  It was served with onion rings (one of the better things served).  The seafood stew had a generous portion of seafood:  crab claws, shrimps, clams, lobster, and squid.  The broth was okay, flavored with cilantro and thai basil.

(It's been reported that the Tao Restaurant is one of the highest gross-ranking restaurants in Vegas!)  Just as we were about to enter the hallway, this VERY large bouncer asks if he could help us and we mention we have reservations and then he allows us to proceed further.  Talk about intimidating, and this was for a 7 pm dinner!\n\nWe were seated upstairs on the balcony overlooking the huge Buddha.  As menus were presented to us, the waitress asked if she could get us some water.  As I perused the flimsy two page menu, front and back, I didn't even know where to begin.  My fellow dining companions were quick to notice the 16 oz. Grilled Kobe Sirloin for $150 and the individually priced nigiri pieces ranging from $3-$15 a piece.\n\nThe menu suggests that all items were going to be served family style, so we asked the waitress for a few suggestions.  I could barely hear her over the hum of the restaurant.  (I would not consider Tao to be romantic at all.)\n\nIn the end we decided to start with four different appetizers and two entrees.  And this is what we got:\n\nSquab Lettuce Wraps ($14) - This came with five lettuce leaves.  A decent amount to fill all the leaves.  The squab mixture was a bit too moist and the BF found it too sweet.  I had squab juice stuff dripping all over my hands right off the bat.  There was a lot of flavor though and crunch, probably from the celery.\n\nLobster Wontons with Shiitake Ginger Broth ($16) - A clay pot arrived with 5 lobster-filled wontons.  Very flavorful with slices of shittake mushrooms laid out too.  A very light and delicate dish.  \n\nSashimi of Kobe Beef with Fresh Wasabi Sauce ($28) - Beautifully presented on a circular clear plate with herbs on top.  We couldn't determine if they were already sliced apart or what, but with the meat being so delicate, just grab a piece and pull and the meat will tear gently apart.  Lovely taste and clean.  However, I didn't recall a wasabi sauce or flavor to it.\n\nPork Spring Roll with Thai Chili Sauce ($11) - This order came with 3 triangles filled with pork, so we requested another order so we could all have a taste.  The spring roll was decent, nothing particular special about it.  The Thai chili sauce tasted store bought though.\n\nMiso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Vegetables ($34) - Very good, but I guess the better question is when have you had a bad piece of Chilean sea bass?\n\nRoasted Thai Buddha Chicken ($26) - We must have misheard the waitress because we thought she said it came in a coconut curry.  It did not, but rather a sweet sauce with about five pieces of chicken in it, including the drumstick.  It was okay, nothing particularly special about it.\n\nJasmine White Rice ($4) - Of course we had to order some rice!  We got two orders which is just enough for four people who aren't heavy rice eaters.\n\nOverall, the food was good.  Definitely overpriced though, and it's catered to a certain kind of clientele.  You'll be amused to find things like Kung Pao Chicken ($26) and Grilled Prime Porterhouse with Wasabi Dipping Sauce ($88) on the same menu.  We decided to pass on dessert as the waitress-recommended Giant Fortune Cookie ($10) or Fuji Apple Springroll ($8) didn't appeal to us enough.  (We actually drove over to Luv-It Frozen Custard instead!)\n\nService is a huge component of what makes this experience worth it or not, and Tao fails in this department.  I was not impressed with the chatty young waiters who dropped (not placed) the silverware onto the table, reached across the BF to put things in front of me, and who 'hid' the menus behind my guest on his chair.  (Uh, who does that?!)  As they moved our glasses and silverware to make room for our dishes, they did it in such an unorganized and messy fashion.  I felt like I was staring at someone's hands trying to do a card trick.  I'm used to the staff performing such tasks in an unnoticed way as to not disrupt the private conversation the dining guests are having.  The waitstaff should take a few lessons from Rosemary's Restaurant's waitstaff.  That's what I call service!\n\nAt the very end of our meal, someone did come by and ask if everything was okay.  And it was...just okay.  They asked if we were going to the club afterward and I said yes and asked if they had any passes.  What they do have is a \"line pass,\" which is really a simple stamp on your inner left wrist so you can supposedly bypass the long line outside.  However, you will still have to pay cover.  (I think this part is rather ridiculous.  They should at least offer a discount on the cover instead.)  With the stamp being so simple, a washing of my hands right after dinner washed it right off.  Not the best pass I would say.\n  \nTao Restaurant is the kind of place you say you've been to and that's it.

When she came by, she was friendly but did not communicate clearly how she was taking our order. Since it was so loud and our waitress didn't have a very loud voice, 3 different members of our group asked her to clarify how much food she thought we should order. She specifically told us that we should order 3-4 starters and at least 5 main dishes. That took me by surprise b/c I thought this is small plates and how could that be enough food? So I repeated what she said to me just to clarify that 3-4 appetizers would enough food for 10 girls? We decided to just order as much as she recommended and we can order more if necessary. \n\nWhen the dishes arrived, we were all suprised at the large portions. What we found out when we got the receipt was that the waitress doubled and tripled each order (as she saw fit) so it would be enough for our table of 9. She NEVER once said she was going to do this and we were upset because we had so much leftover food and even ate more than we wanted so it wouldn't be wasted.\n\nIf we had known this is what she was going to do, we would have ordered different items.

Go ahead and make that money, But there has to be a balance that waiters don't cross or else it will be TOO obvious & the customer will give you a 10% tip of the slightly bigger check instead of the 20% they were planning to give if the guy acted like what he was suppose to be, a good waiter.  \nWhen we sat down, we were offered 2 choices of water, both of which they charge for.  The option of bottled water is normal for \"high class\" restaurants everywhere, but it's the a-hole way of wording & tone that pisses you off.  My group of 6 didn't care for the bottled water because we were all ordering cocktails & beers anyways.  So we said \"Just normal tab water is fine\".

Couple of us in the group comes to vegas about 5 times a yr for business with the company.  We've been to more than a few trendy restaurants in the 5 star properties.

All the food were very normal, nothing bad, nothing special.\n\nCHECK - When we were done, Davy comes over & said \"You guys have to get desert, everybody's doing it\" What a pathetic half joke half pressure line.  We passed on it.  When he brings the check, we find that its more than what it was suppose to be.  On a closer look, he charged us for the price of entrees for 2 orders when we ordered appetizers.  Davy insisted that he gave us the entrees which we wouldn't know because the portions were all small.  Even if he did, it was his mistake when he took the order as we honestly all heard our friends order the appetizer.

Without reservations, this place is impossible to get into, unless you know people, or do the ol' slipping a bill into the handshake action.  (If you do, try $20 or higher)\n\n- Come with friends that are ready to party, because this is a party joint!  Meet at the bar, so that if you have folks coming in from different hotels, you can enjoy the drinks while you wait.\n\n- Once you're seated, order sharable appetizers, like the Edamame, Satay Chicken, or  Thai Stuffed Shrimps.\n\n- If you like Sake, they have a pretty good selection of Sakes.  If you haven't tried the Nigori Sake (unfiltered), I'd suggest at least trying that.  The best way is to ask the server to give you the rundown.We had the Voice in the Mist bottle and it was yummy!\n\n- For your entree, you MUST get Miso-Glazed Chilean Seabass!!  It's my favorite fish entree in the world!  Savory white flaky tender bits of tasty fish... oh my.  It definitely melts in your mouth yet creates a flavor explosion.  So good!  My friend likes the Wasabi Crusted Filet Mignon, but I think it's not nearly as good as the Seabass.\n\nI've been to Tao now for 3 years.  I've had a great experience every single time.

The stone \"baths\" greet you as you walk to the hostess station...each time I've visited they have been filled with water, rose petals and candles. I've heard mention that there may be events where Buddha nymphs are soaking in the tubs...could be urban legend, could be wishful thinking by drunken pigs. Either way, I wish I was a Tao bath girl.... \n\nBut I digress...back to the food. Whether dining alone at the sushi bar, partying with friends, or starting at a special someone this place accommodates the mood. Dark wood, candle light, ginormous statues of the Buddha, fresh flowers, small medium and large Buddha statues abound. I have not yet had the pleasure of seeing the club - but dining here has been enough satisfaction. \n\nThe sushi is divine and overpriced...individual order are great but if you really want to be impressed, throw your credit card to the wind and go for the \"chef's special\". - otherwise known as sushi roulette in Vegas. You give them an amount to spend and then wait for monster plate. The sashimi of Kobe beef (think carpaccio) is glorious, buttery, melty goodness and even better with the smokey sauce that accompanies the avocado tempura (sin on a plate). \n\nPeking duck eggrolls, Sea Bass meal or satay small plate, scallops...you could spend forever savoring.

We had 9:45 reservations at the restaurant and the morning of our reservation they called to confirm. We thought Tao was the perfect place for dinner because we heard about the great food and if you eat dinner there \n\nLater that evening we got to the restaurant at 9:40 to make sure we were seated promptly. A lot of us were starving because of the late dinner reservation but that was what we could get. 10:10 we stil weren't seated. I decided to go drop off something at the hotel room since we were staying in the Palazzo. Being that we had a late dinner reservation I decided to try to get a stamp to ensure that I could easily come back to the restaurant. I go to this desk near the door to ask for a stamp. The guy tells me that I need to get in line for a stamp. I look at the line and it's empty so I crawled under the rope. Immediately this security guard comes over.\n\nGuard: Excuse me Maam, you'll need to go all the way outside to get in line. You can't line jump.\n\nI look out at the entrance which was only a few feet from me and there's still no one in line.\n\nMe: Umm there's no one in line.\n\nGuard: I know that but you can't line jump. My manager won't have it and I'll be the weak link.\n\nSo begrudgingly I go outside. There's another guard at the entrance. He proceeds to tell me that it's a $20 cover to get in.\n\nMe: What? I was just in the restaurant and they told me to come out here to get a stamp. I have dinner reservations here and just want to drop something off in my room\n\nGuard 2: Well if you have dinner reservations you'll have to get in the reservation line to get a stamp.\n\nMe: I was in the reservation line to check in and they didn't give us a stamp.\n\nGuard 2: Well that's where you'll need to go\n\nI stand in the reservation line. A guy is yelling at the hostess letting her know that he's been waiting 50 minutes for a table, and they had reservations too. The hostess wasn't giving in and the guy got angry, threw the pager at her, and yelled some obscenities.\n\nI proceed to tell my story to the hostess and she tells me that she has to get the stamp girl to come over to give me a stamp and I have to wait. My friend Kelly comes up to the desk because we've been waiting for a while for our table. Kelly talks to the hostess.\n\nHostess: Oh right, you had a table for 4\n\nKelly: No 8. You guys called this morning to confirm\n\nHostess: 8? Oh... well then you'll have to come back in 5 minutes and then I can tell you what's available.\n\nKelly: Why can't you tell me what's available now? We had 9:45 reservations and it's 10:20 now.\n\nHostess: Just come back in 5 minutes and I'll let you know what's available.\n\nkelly and I are upset but because we had a group of girls for a bacheleorette and they all wanted to go clubbing, Tao was the best option because we get dinner and the club included so we decide to proceed with dinner.\n\nI then proceed to ask the hostess again about the stamp. She says that I need to finish my dinner before I can get stamped. UGH!\n\nWe finally get seated and eat our meal. The food isn't that great. I've gotten better at normal $5 chinese restaurants. The waiter brings Kelly brown rice instead of white. She mentions it and he says, \"Don't worry I won't charge you for it.\" \n\nAt the end of dinner, lo and behold we were charged for the rice. Kelly mentions it and tells the guy that he said he wouldn't charge.\n\nWaiter: I don't remember saying that. Since you ate it we have to charge you for it\n\nKelly: No i mentioned it to you and you said you wouldn't. That's the reason I ate it\n\nWaiter: Tell you what. I can hook you up.

This place offers eye candy galore for both men and women...bonus!  \n\nItems we ordered:\n\n* Lobster Wontons with Shiitake Ginger Broth ($18) - my friends said this was tasty.  I didn't try any, so can't attest to the taste...although it smelled wonderful.  The wontons were served in a clay pot, simmering gently in it's ginger broth. \n\n* Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Wok Vegetables ($34) - this dish was once again very delicious.

The stir-fried veggies and fried tofu pieces rounded out the dish perfectly.  \n\n* Crispy Spicy Tuna Roll ($16 / six pieces) - I really enjoyed this roll, which consisted of spicy minced tuna spread thickly on crispy rice cakes (cut into rectangular pieces).  \n\n* TAO Angry Dragon Roll with Eel & Kabayaki Sauce ($15 / eight slices) - I enjoyed this roll, but it's just your standard eel roll...nothing special about it.  \n\n* Kobe Tartar Tempura ($19 / eight slices) - The minced Kobe beef was wrapped in seaweed, which was then encased in sushi rice and deep fried.  On the side was a bed of marinated, sliced Shiitake mushrooms (which was sweet and delicious).  \n\n* Black Pepper Sizzled Filet Mignon with Udon Noodles ($29) - can't say much about this since I didn't get a bite, but it looked and smelled good.  The serving was plentiful, compared with the other dishes.\n\n* Molten Chocolate Cake ($10) - this came with coconut ice cream, but they honored our request for vanilla ice cream instead.  \n\n* Assorted Ice Creams and Sorbets ($8) - served with a couple of almond sesame cookies.  \n\nDrinks: Glass of Scarbolo Pinot Grigio ($10) / Tao-Tini ($13) / Orange Dragon ($13) /  Bottle of Corona ($8).  \n\nFor our entertainment, we witnessed this drunk lady that somehow ended up on the lap of the huge Buddha.

What's the point of making a reservation if we're stuck waiting in the lounge anyway? The hostesses were not very helpful or friendly either. \"Your table will be ready in a few minutes\" turned into a dreadful prolonged standstill in our evening.

It took me a while to regain the sensation in my tongue from the blazing hot flavor, but the rest of my friends thought it was pretty tasty. The miso glazed Chilean seabass was one of the best dishes at the table.

Not to mention the crowd of tourists and revealingly dressed beautiful and less beautiful people.

We got a drink at the bar. Yes, well drinks were expensive but not surprising for Vegas. Once we were seated, we had a nice view of the gigantic Buddha. Our server was very friendly and informative. I felt in general the waitstaff was attentive, even though the restaurant was so busy.\n\nAs appetizers, we ordered the lobster dumplings in shitake mushroom broth, spicy ahi tuna on top of crispy white rice (basically like nigiri) and the toro toro roll. The dumplings and broth were excellent but the skin of the won tons were a little thick. The spicy ahi tuna was yuuummmy. The toro toro roll was the weakest dish. The fish was not very prominent, which was disappointing since I love toro. This roll was also topped with some sort of crunchy, sweet cracker-like topping that I did not love. \n\nWe also had two entrees: the black pepper flank steak and udon noodles, and miso-glazed sea bass. The steak and udon noodles were okay; nothing special. The miso-glazed sea bass was delicious and perfectly cooked. The vegetables it came with were somewhat of an afterthought but the sea bass was so beautifully cooked that I didn't care too much.\n\nDefinitely a fun, vibrant, LOUD environment.

Not really...cos both times I wore heels that were way too high and uncomfortable and ended the night walking around without shoes. Note to self: DO NOT wear ridiculous shoes when you intend to walk more than 3 steps. \n\nI digress...I digress...back to Tao. Contrary to popular belief, both times I was here (once with 8 people and once with 4), we were able to get tables (the first time we called the night before and the next time we just walked in) on Saturday nights.

They look that zen and inviting. \n\nThis latest visit I made to Tao started with drinks at the bar while waiting for our table. Lychee Martinis...I made sure to ask for \"extra strong\" martinis and that was delivered. A great start to the night. The waiter we had was very knowledgeable about the food. He knew exactly what went in each dish. Tao is also very vegetarian friendly. They can substitute tofu in many dishes and there are many veggie options. Ok now to the dishes:\n\n1. Shishito Peppers - Yum Yum...very nice and interesting. Never had these before. I probably wouldn't order these if I didn't have more than 4 people in my party. Rather large portion and the taste is interesting only the first couple of bites\n\n2. Sake Infused Mushrooms - OK I am going to go insane right now. This was soooo good....i HATE sake and I'm salivating all over my laptop right now. I can't even describe this dish. You just need to get it. NEED TO I tell you\n\n3. Steamed Veggie Dumplings - The dumplings itself were pretty normal. Nothing out of the regular dumpling world. Don't get me wrong, they were good...just nothing to write a paragraph about (although I guess I already have). Now, the dumplings came with this AMAZING crunchy cucumber side. Ok...seriously...cooked cucumbers. Sounds icky but Yum Yum Yum. Very very nice...\n\n4. Fried Brown Rice with Veggies - Wow. Crispy lettuce, perfectly cooked tofu, simple flavors and you wouldn't even know you are eating brown rice (I don't like brown rice). Tastes sooo good. This is literally the best fried rice I've had outside of Asia. And I've eaten many a fried rice\n\n5. Mango Tamarind Martini - This one tasted sooooo good. Masked the taste of alcohol (i can't stand the taste of alcohol) and tasted interesting with just a hint of tamarind. A perfect complement to the meal. The drink still packed a good punch even though you couldn't taste the \"punch.\"\n\nWe ended the meal with the 4 of us sharing a chocolate cake of some sort. I'm not a fan of chocolate cakes in general so I can't really remember how it tasted. The girls seemed to like it though. \n\nWe even got our hands stamped to get into Tao (the club area) after we ate.

They just get THAT much traffic, and we still had to wait about 10 minutes before getting our reserved table. Our server Darren was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu and specials.

Lesson learned! I started off my appetizers with an Orient Express cocktail ($13) with Kahlua and Vanilla Liqueur.  My bamboo steamed vegetable dumplings (which were green!) and crunchy cucumbers (Japanese style, bitter like ginger) for $10 satisfied my grumbling stomach quite well. \n\nMy main was Buddha's Harmonized Vegetable Feast for the Minor Gods, which was an entree-sized udon in sesame & black peppercorn sauce with red pepper, onions, bok choy, asparagus, and brussel sprouts to top it off ($17). A vegetarian feast indeed. The dish came in a bowl which made it less messy than it probably would have been had it come on a plate, but I wasn't expecting the amount of spice. Still, a great veggie entree (maybe the only veggie entree!).\n\nTip: The restrooms say \"Yin\" and \"Yang.\" Yin is for the women and Yang is for the men. \n\nDarren offered us a menu of \"temptation\" which was the right word for it. I could barely get any more food in my stomach so I wanted ice cream. And I got to choose 3 different scoops: White Chocolate & Yuzu, Cocunut, and Green Tea with almond cookies and even Pocky sticks ($8) - bonus. The thing is, I think the Yuzu (a Japanese fruit much like tangerine) was overpowering the white chocolate, or else they were two separate flavours and they brought me the wrong one. I couldn't finish the scoops anyway, because we also got two chocolate fortune cookies!\n\nThe Vegas magazines say this restaurant is only a $30 meal, but we spent about double that including drinks, appetizers and dessert.\n\nTao Restaurant is truly a religious dining experience as they say.

Nice, real nice.\n\nOh, and stop comparing Asian restaurants to Panda Express- it's getting old.\n\nFirst off, you can obviously tell that I love this place.  Let me tell you why.\n\nEven during the first time I ate at Tao, I didn't expect it to be a quaint and gentle dinner made by a world-renowned chef.  Tao's advertisements have a naked woman with \"Always a happy ending\" tatooed to her back in Chinese.  Seriously, what did you expect?  If you think that kind of lewd advertisement says, \"Bob and Daisy's Kosher Garden Cafe,\" I'll fly myself to your city to slap you.\n\nI came there and got what I expected and a bit more.  Stunning interior design by a NY firm whose design philosophy is heavily based on catering to the audience.  From the dramatic lighting, the 2-story buddha, and the naked girls in the bathtubs at the tunnel entrance- if you think you can take your grandma on her tennis-ball walker to this restaurant, you deserve a second slap.\n\nAs far as the food goes, it was fine.  Yes, I could've gotten better food at an off-strip restaurant, but was I there mainly to have the ultimate epicurean experience?  Absolutely not, I was there to eat, enjoy the energy of the restaurant and most importantly, to have fun with my friends.\n\nWhat, you're gonna give a restaurant who serves amazing food 5 stars even when the food is served on paper plates and they're located in a rat-infested hole in the wall with horrible servers?  Don't be ridiculous.\n\nAs far as the service goes, I'll admit- it's not flawless.  They do know a lot about the menu and about Japanese and pan-Asian cuisine, and they're quite attentive.  But the hostesses could be a bit more polite.  You know why they're ticked off by the end of the night?\n\nImagine yourself as a tall blonde girl with 32C's, getting drunk calls at all hours of the night, getting hit on and gropped by the occasional stranger.. and hassled by the idiot who decided to bring their 3 year old child and needs a baby seat.\n\nOf course, this is no excuse for the management to hire more enduring hostesses, but they don't care.  The money is coming, and they still remain as one of the most highest earning on the strip in terms of annual revenue.\n\nAnyways, you've heard it all.  I love this place because it's a place I can enjoy inexpensive food (seriously, $12 pad thai isn't that much on the Vegas strip), amazing interior, decent service, with people I know who can enjoy it with me.\n\nYou want amazing food, go to Joel Robuchon.

I thought, okay they wanna make sure so when we come by they have a table ready for us....how spiffy. Was I wrong! We all got there 5 minutes before our expected arrival hoping to get some food and then head to the club upstairs. To my surprised, we get a pager and we are told to wait until a table is ready in ten to fifteen minutes. WTF?!! We confirmed earlier that we will be there and we come early and we STILL had to wait?!?!? Mind you that we have not eaten and we are all starving so, we were pretty frustrated....and after fifteen minutes....no pager action so we head to the front and ask when we will be seated. The host looked flustered and told someone to lead us to the table. Wow such \"wonderful\" service and it doesn't end there.\n\nWhen we finally got seated (also I was looking around when we were taken to our seats....there were plenty of open tables), I looked through the menu and decided what to order in like 5 minutes. I kept a timer near by me because I saw how much the waiter was passing us and it took them 20 minutes from handing out our menus to actually take our orders down. \n\nWhen we finally got our food, the only good thing about it was probably the plate it was on. I ordered the Thai roasted chicken. When I ate my first piece of it, I realized that the chicken was dry....not the way I like my chicken to be cooked.

I even a bite from my boyfriends food...Meh it was alright.\n\nMy overall review for this place, we came in at 9 and didn't leave until 11 due to waiting for service to come by. I think we spent probably a good 75% of the time just waiting. So what do i say about the service, that IT SUCKS! The food was not worth the taste or the price.

Never thought what is essentially peanut butter would go so well with fish.  The Thai crab cakes with mango chili sauce while not purely crab meat just pairs so well with the sauce.  Well balanced.  The spicy tuna tartar on crispy rice crackers, a great twist on the classic.  Outstanding.  Bold flavor, cool tuna, crispy rice cracker.  So much contrast make for a delicious bite of food.  Finally the  kobe beef sashimi with fresh wasabi; yum.\n\nDo not pass on the Peking duck spring roll with hoisin sauce or the lobster and shrimp spring roll with spicy pineapple sauce.

The food was average for Asian food at best.  What do you expect, right?  It's an restaurant with food from all different Asian cuisines, probably not doing any of them real justice.  Then I got my entree which was miso seabass.  OMFG.  I eat lots and lots and lots of fish and seafood.  When I go out to eat, that's pretty much all I ever eat.  The fillet was over 1\" thick and cooked to absolute perfection.  It friggin' fell apart with hardly any pressure of the fork.  The miso was perfect.  Just a light coating which really enhanced the flavor of the fish itself instead of drowning or masking the taste of the fish.  So the hero of the plate?  The fish.  Ding ding!!!  We have a winner.  So many times I get fish and the hero of the plate is the sauce on top.  If you have a very fresh fish cooked properly the sauce should be mild and minimal.  I was jumping for joy.

My friend (who knows more about the NBA than anyone I've ever met) caught sight of a small sign sitting outside the restaurant. The poster showed a just a pair of eyes and some small text. Of course, my friend recognized right away that these were no ordinary eyes. These were Lebron James's eyes. He read the sign with urgency. Turns out, Lebron was going to make an appearance at Tao Nightclub after eating at Tao Asian Bistro. My friend almost fell over with excitement. \"I don't care what it costs, that's where we are going afterwards.\" I laughed and agreed that we would inquire. \n\nWe walked through the hall of little basins filled with water and rose petals, and the hostess welcomed us immediately. \n\nShe walked us through the restaurant, which is dimly lit and has a huge Buddha on the first floor. The ceiling is decorated with large canvases of calligraphy writing. Stunning displays of portraiture line the back wall and restroom hallway. The hostess seated us on the second floor. The ambiance was just the right combination of bustling, formal/casual, and you know, that Vegas \"je ne sais quoi\". \n\nOur waiter appeared promptly. He gave excellent cocktail and entree suggestions, and when asked, informed us that I (as a lady) would get in free to the Lebron party, and my friend would pay about $25. Which I'm sure was deeply discounted. Not only that, but we got stamps on our wrists to bypass the line. \n\nI ordered the blueberry/pomegranate martini and it was delicious. My friend loved the Orient Express (a coffee-based martini). The tuna tartare was amazing, and I ordered the special (which was a short rib udon). The food blew our expectations away. Sure, it's a VERY expensive meal, but it's Las Vegas. \n\nI thought they did an excellent job of offering a fusion selection that didn't over-complicate.

The food would be 2- or maybe 3-star material if it was 1/3 the price, because given the quality of the filet mignon in my main dish I promise you it wasn't worth the $40 they're asking.

The whole dish is covered in an extremely artificial just-came-out-of-a-box tasting sauce, and the peppers lack flavor. The chicken that my fianc\u00e9 ordered had potential and she was happy with the way it was cooked, but it was overall \"only okay\" as she says. I had a taste and hated it, but that was just the flavor. Not something I would have ordered. Also, I was probably jaded by my garbage steak already.\n\nWe ordered a side of pork fried rice also. This was a semi-bright spot on the night. The rice was very good, and there were a lot of vegetables which we liked. Big fans of veggies. But the pork in the rice was bad. It was small chunks and also tasted and felt like it had come right out of a box and popped into the microwave.\n\nNow the sushi was amazing. I don't remember what it was called but it was their special for the day or week or something, and included salmon, real crab, avocado, caviar, ginger (I think), and a spicy-ish sauce.

If everyone in your party orders an \"entree\" (which range from $30-$45), you get free admission into the club.  The best part is that you can bypass the ridiculous line altogether!

I was expecting extremely sub-par PF chang's style food, but I actually came out decently impressed.  I ordered the Pepper beef filet Mignon and it had quite a bit of meat and decent flavor.

I got to try some of it and it was actually pretty good (think Yardhouse Sea Bass).\n\nLong story short, if you're looking into getting 10 guys into a club and don't want to wait in line, Tao Asian Bistro should definitely be at the top of your list.

It could bother some older people though but it set the tone for the ambiance of the place and I personally enjoyed it.  I suggest making a reservation to the place since it is pretty busy.  The wait for our table did not take too long. We were able to grab a drink at the bar right there located in the entrance and get our barrings and enjoy what this place had to offer. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The food..amazing. I had the chilean sea bass..OMG! So good..so worth it. Boyfriend had the kobe steak topped with onions, amazing as well! Dessert was terrific.  After dinner, if you wanted to go to the nightclub all you have to do is ask your waiter and a hostess will stamp your hand to get in to the club. You still have to go outside to check your i.d. but the wait in the line is minimal.  \nSo, why the 3 star?  Well everything was GREAT except at the end of our meal when the waiter brought BACK our check to sign the total. I wasn't sure what that was about but pointed to my boyfriend to have him sign it because he was paying for it. Now, we are seated very close to the other people and the waiter yells out, \" Well when you tip me less than 10% you have to initial that's what you want.\"  People next to us were looking at us and my face just went flush! Then he walked away muttering something under his breath, I was trippin! My boyfriend had miscalculated the tip, not usually coming to a place like this and feeling a bit uncomfortable, he quickly signed the bill over and gave it to the waiter not realizing he miscalculated the tip.  Now, I understand..don't get me wrong. I was a bartender so tips are apart of your income and perhaps in a place like this, management may look at the waiters performance as a reason why his tip was so small, which clearly was not the case, he was great. But to embarrass us like that, really upset me and instead of going to the club later, we just decided to go home. So much for a romantic night. But you know, regardless of all that, I do know that Vegas thrives on money and on our way out I gave the waiter another tip because he was good, no doubt. IT was just a misunderstanding. \nAgain, I understand where the waiter was coming from but jeeze, maybe speak softer and don't walk away muttering things under your breathe making us feel like we were unwelcomed and like we did not belong.

The big buddha especially was appealing.  We considering just popping by for the club at first, but decided we may as well just eat here instead.  Boy do I regret that.\n\nFirst, the service.  For a high-scale, populous, touristy area such as where Tao is located, I would except only the best of service.  This started on the wrong foot, when my party was running 15 minutes late, and called out of politeness to notify and apologize to the restaurant like we always do.  Here's a first:  when I asked if our reservation could be pushed back by 15 minutes due to a slight delay, the hostess replied, \"15 minutes should be okay.. any later, and it's up to the manager's discretion on your reservation.\"  What?  What kind of BS rudeness is this.  I can understand that for a top-notch restaurant, space is limited and therefore any outrageously late reservations / no shows will be given to people who have been waiting for a seat.  But we were only 15 minutes late, and by the time we arrived, there was no one waiting in line.  That just added salt to the wound - if there had been an extremely long line with multiple aggravated parties waiting to be seated, sure.  But don't spout some BS to us over the phone and cause us to rush when it wasn't even needed with a passive aggressive threat to our reservation.  Also, during my reservation, we had requested a seat next to the large Buddha.  Granted, I understand requests are not always given, but it was for my girlfriend's graduation dinner, and the fact that there were empty seats around the Buddha when we passed by it made me wonder what exactly the manager does when training his employees on the ideals of service.  Nevertheless, we spoke up when they attempted to seat us in some dark corner, and waited while the hostess \"discussed\" with another our seating preferences, and reseated us after 2-3 minutes.  \n\nMoving on, the decor.  They get an additional star for this, otherwise this would have been a one-star review.  As a tourist, we love seeing flashy, new things - my camera is always ready in my hand.  First, they had multiple beautiful rose petal water baths in the entrance (for visual pleasure of course).  The light was dimly set, but not dark enough where you can't see a thing due to the illuminations of all the other decor.  Aside from the various Asian inspired ornaments we saw, the Big Buddha was again the most appealing factor of this restaurant.  Definitely bring a camera if you're the type who wants to see things like this - it'll be one of your only high points of the night.\n\nThird, food.  Meh.  PF Changs puts the same amount of flavor, for 1/3 of the price.  It's basically just heavy MSG foods with some fancy names, and more expensive types of food such as lobster.  I won't go too deep into what we had, but our party had a variety of different types ranging from sushi rolls to lobster to fish.  The fish was the best - it was flaky, with a great texture and the right amount of sauce.  Everything else fell far below my expectations.  \n\nFourth, price.  Ugh.  $35-$40 per entree.  And I feel as if I could get most of this from my local chinese take-out, minus some expensive stuff like lobster.  However, just because you offer a few expensive dishes doesn't mean you can charge premium price.  If the taste isn't there, it's not worth it.  If the service is subpar, it's not worth it.  I would have been fine with Tao, possibly giving it 3-4 stars, if these dishes are maximum $20.  But for what we got - a rehash of what we could get anywhere else, for up to $40+?

The pepper steak was very good.  The filet was sliced and barely stir fried with the vegetables.  The stand out was the sauce again!  It was rich and very flavorful.\n\nFor dessert, we again took different paths.  Paula got the crispy Fuji apple blossoms with Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream and I got the chocolate spring rolls\n with Kalamansi dipping sauce.  The rolls were good but they weren't stuffed with chocolate as I hoped they would be.  Rather, there was some melted chocolate on a leaf and the rolls were placed on the chocolate.  Regardless, they were good.  The dipping sauce was non-descript.  I really couldn't say it had much of a flavor.  It tasted more like mango than orange.  For Paula's apple blossoms, they were triangle puff pastries with apple filling.  They were good.\n\nService was very good.  My iced tea was refilled when it got halfway down.

The server said their signature dish was the miso sea bass, definitely worth trying, and our server suggested the sausage fried rice with fried egg on top, also amazing. Service was great, drinks were tasty. \n\nSo why only 4 stars?  A couple reasons. Number one, I don't like being sold something right away. When we sat down our server briefly went over the drink lists and immediately asked if we wanted something from the bar. Nice to ask, but how about giving us some time to look through the lists you just pointed out. Or even better, how about offering some water first.  And when I say offering, I mean offering all options. Not just bottled water. It just seems like a sneaky way to get just a little more money out of me. I don't want to feel like I'm at a car dealership when I'm eating at a restaurant. \n\nThe second reason for the downgrade was the robotic repetitiveness in the restaurant. Explanation. We got our appetizers, ther server came by and asked us if we had everything we needed and we said we were fine. 5 minutes later a  manager came by and asked us if we have everything we need and we said we were great. Our entrees came out and our server asked if we had everything we needed, we were fine. A few minutes later a different manager came by and asked us...you guessed it, do we have everything we need. Not how is the food or how are we enjoying everything so far, just do we have everything we need. Now, you might say to yourself that's not so bad. But it was just me and my friend, and all the tables of two are literally right next to each other so we can hear the interactions of all the tables around us.  We had 3 tables within earshot of our own, and I must have heard \"do you have everything you need?\" 15 times between the servers and the managers. It's one of those things that once you notice you can't help but hear it. \n\nNormally I wouldn't even nitpick over something so trivial but i also heard the other servers in the area ask for drink orders immediately and only offer bottled water.  These are all clearly restaurant policies that take away from the restaurant. I don't want to feel like a step in a training manual. All those little annoyances aside this restaurant is awesome.

Word to the wise: TAO = a place where the customer is always wrong.\n\nHere's the skinny: we dined 11 deep Saturday evening while in town celebrating my 32nd birthday. It's Memorial Day weekend and expected to be a madhouse in Vegas, so I made every precaution to secure reservations, be on time for said reservations and ensure my entire party was on time with me. I may not be Kim Kardashian, but perhaps the manager failed to note that my reservation was made by someone who works directly with them and asked for my party to be taken care of. I'm also assuming they didn't know that I am a celebrity publicist in LA and have sent numerous clients to spend thousands of dollars at their establishment. Maybe if this was noted my party would have received better service. \n\nFood: my boyfriend and I split the chicken dumplings, the spicy yellowtail sushi roll and the chicken pad thai. More than enough food! The pad thai seemed to be in a never-ending bowl! It alone would have fed the 2 of us easily. The dumplings were the best choice out of our order. Fresh, steamed and flavorful. I only wish there were more in an order! The roll was good, but nothing special. My friend had the BBQ pork and it was phenomenal. I'd look into that if BBQ meats are your thing. The pad thai was pretty standard. It was also good but nothing to write home about. Nonetheless, I was pleased with the overall good experience. The crowning glory was the giant fortune cookie that was sent out for my birthday (it is filled with both vanilla and chocolate cream - oh hey ying yang!) - which was the only good move by the restaurant the entire meal.\n\nThe service: this is where things get rough. We sat down for our 8:30pm reservation around 8:45pm. We didn't mind the 15 minute wait. We're a large party and it's Saturday night - reservations can take some time. I get it. We sat down and didn't see a waitress for nearly 20 minutes. When she finally came by the table she took our drink order and bounced for another 20 minutes or so. My friend asked for an iced tea that 40 minutes later had never made it's way to the table. When we asked about it, the waitress took another 15 minutes to bring it claiming that they had to \"brew a new pot\". Ok. Then when we were an hour and a half into our dinner order waiting for more beverages the waitress was M.I.A. We finally called over the manager and asked if we could please get some drinks (one of which had already been ordered and never brought to the table). His response was \"what? Are you trying to get something free out of this?\". I'm sorry? No. We are trying to get our drinks and spend more money in your establishment. Wow. The next epic failure of this restaurant/nightclub comes from the security guard/staff. My boyfriend got up from the table to take a work related call. It was noisy inside so he stepped outside to take it. When he came back in a security guard grabbed him by his shirt and said \"where do you think you're going?! Get in line!\" To which my boyfriend responded - \"I've been sitting with a table of 11 for nearly 2 hours. I just stepped outside to take a call.\" The guard then responded \"yeah right\" and grabbed him by his shirt collar. When he turned around to radio someone my boyfriend just yanked himself free and walked inside. The final straw was when the waitress asked if we'd like to divide the tab. We said yes and tried to be fair by making a few groups so as not to create 11 separate checks for her. Tik-tok - 1 hour later (literally) she plopped down the checks with a look of irritation and left. \n\nTotal time in restaurant (due to slow service) - 3.5 hours!! It was nearly midnight when we finally left!\n\nThe club was hopping but we were not interested in that. We just wanted a nice dinner in what seemed to be only a mildly busy restaurant. A party of 11 would have left a much bigger tip had the service been respectable.

First of all, the hostess with the blonde hair and orange dress was a total petty bitch and did not want to seat us. Had us waiting for over an hour for a table when we saw several open. We would have at least ordered drinks and  appetizers but there was no service in the waiting area. The waiting area was blaring with loud EDM music, not at all conducive for dinner or lounge talk and definitely scared us a bit thinking that the club would be the same. Meanwhile, troops of people with questionable attractiveness and boldly comfortable physiques would trapes in every few minutes heading over to the nightclub area. We were already on the guestlist for the party but having had good history with their sister company, Lavo, we wanted to try the food first,  but in these moments, both the dinner and club scene here were so off putting. The night started off quite weak. Once we were seated, after 12, finally the service came pouring in. At least 3 or 4 servers came to our table to excuse the slackness and eager to be of service. Nice view of the big Buddha statue in the center. Food was decent, we enjoyed the pan fried chicken gyoza, the lobster wontons and the rock shrimp lettuce cups were ok, we kind of got full off of just appetizers cause again, large portions. My cousins miso sea bass entree was good. Strong miso flavor, but if you're cool with that, its good. Big portion of chicken pad thai by someone else. I dont like pad thai or peanut tastes so i didnt taste it but she enjoyed. Looked big and fresh. I split the shrimp, lobster, scallop in bean sauce entree with someone else because it sounded big and also to cut costs and have more things on the table to taste. Was really looking forward to it, it has all of my favorite meaty chewy seafoods. It was shockingly bad, dont know if there was an error made in the sauce recipe, but I have had plenty of similar dishes in the past, never have any been half as bad, and it came highly recommended by the waiter and was amongst the most expensive so we were surprised that it was so bitter. The table tasted and agreed that the sauce had an unpleasant taste. The waiter took it off of our bill gracefully and we left a great tip in exchange. In this moment, the great service that we are accustomed to from Lavo, was thankfully shining through here at Tao as well. A nice chick came to our table to stamp us and set us up for the complimentary club access. As I said before, we were already on the guestlist so didnt need it, but its nice that they have that additional incentive for dining there, as Lavo used to do.

Unfortunately there was a large, very loud group next to us so I asked for a different table and almost immediately we got taken to the loungy section of the restaurant that seemed much more secluded and still had a great view. They had some mellow music (random trip hop and electronica from what i can remember) playing in the background and the dim lights give the lounge a very mellow secluded vibe. Some of the decor is a carry over from Social House but it all comes together really well. The manager totally made sure we were comfortable with our new table and even the waiter made a nice comment about it.\n\nWhen the pirate show started we went outside on the patio to watch and our waitress later came out to let us know our food had arrived. The patio outside gives a great view of the show below and its way better than crowding on the sidewalk and i'm sure in the winter when it gets cold, its way better to stand up there by the heaters than in the 40 degree cold on the street.\n\nTowards the end of our meal we asked the waitress for a couple of club recommendations as we've all been out of the scene for a while and she threw some ideas at us. Even checked with a coworker to give us extra options which was definitely nice.\n\nUnfortunately we came there after already having dinner and weren't all that hungry. Ordered an appetizer and the dark chocolate eggroll which rocked. I can't comment much on the food since we ate so little of it but will say this: obviously this isn't a traditional restaurant so expect a fusion style menu.

I wish it was a little cooler especially in the summer.  I enjoy the different Asian cuisines in one place. From what I could see the cuisines represented were Vietnamese, Chinese and Japanese and Fuku burger (which is one of my favorite food trucks in town).  I thought overall there would be more options and the food quality in the window would look better even Panda Express food looks like the freshness and quality is better.\n\nI would have to agree that buying food from different places were annoying.

I wanted the summer rolls in which the cashier gave me but then I said, where is the peanut sauce? He replied we don't have that. I said, um, its right there in your display and who would serve summer rolls without peanut sauce? He looked confused. I pointed to the display and he said, oh let me ask. You need to hire people that are knowledgeable in the cuisine.  We paid for our 2 choice plate.

Unfortunately, my hopes were shot down soon after watching my friend order food. \n\nThey have a boba place inside as well as a place where you can order dishes like a restaurant and a place where you can order food down a line like Panda Express. Looking at the prices that they had at the boba place, it was a little pricy and I can't expect it to have that much better quality than somewhere off the strip, and so I deem the price a little higher than normal. I understand rent must be expensive, but they won't be making money with higher prices. \n\nThe area where you can order food had a variety of dishes from different Asian cuisines, but this again was a little expensive. I can't imagine it tasting any better than somewhere off the strip at a specific ethnic restaurant, and especially for the price they were charging, $11 for fried rice is a little much. They also have dim sum & dumplings and they list it out what kind they have on the window. The prices are a little expensive for how much they give you, which is the usual 4 at traditional dim sum places. $4.99+ for an order is not worth getting while you are there, you might as well go out somewhere else off the strip for dim sum. \n\nThe area where you can pick out food like at Panda Express was also pricy and it didn't look very good, it seemed as though it was sitting out there for a while. When my friend ordered food from there, she got the duck and they microwaved it... You know, when you're at home at they're leftovers, it's ok to microwave food, but when you order food from outside of your own home, that ain't cool bro. That right there was just shocking for me that a place would even do that. So I don't think the food will look too appetizing unless it came fresh out of the kitchen, just make sure they don't microwave the food before they give it to you.\n\nLast but not least, when my friend's food was finished, they brought the food out to where we were sitting. When the waitress (or whatever category you want to put them in) brought out her food, the tray didn't have utensils and the waitress said she forgot and asked her to get it herself. Umm... I think that's a little bit rude to say, and you have a job where you mostly stand right next to the front anyways, so I don't understand why she couldn't have just gotten them right after. \n\nI don't mind the higher prices of the places inside the Linq, I can at least understand that much, but when you have unappealing food, microwave food, and have bad service, that's a big nono there.

FAME was none of those things - it was just an over glorified, expensive lounge-y looking food court.  IMHO, they tried a little too hard on the decor - you really just needed some plastic folding tables, plastic chairs, fluorescent lighting and you'd have something more authentic. \n\nThe layout is confusing - some stalls had menus while others didn't. Boba was $9. Need I continue? Stalls included a Beard Papa-boba/dessert place, a Fuku burger, noodle stall, and some dim sum/Chinese BBQ stall. We dropped by around noon on Saturday to check the place out and it was dead. Walked by the Fuku burger and it peaked our interest. I eventually did come back around 1:50 am and ate at Fuku Burger and really liked my meal (got the #5 with jazz fries - good drunk food at reasonable prices). The one downside of Fuku is that it closes at 2 a.m. - it really should be open until at least 3 or 4 a.m. for the club crowd to sober up at. \n\nOverall, they need to totally rethink the execution of this place - bring in some high profile brands from LA's SGV and let them set up shop here. Boba can be from Half and Half, desserts from Bambu - it can still be overpriced  b/c as of right now, it's the only option for that kind of stuff on the Strip.

They have since shut their doors and Teriyaki Boy took over.  Teriyaki Boy still has the same line up and even supports ex-Mr. O Jay Cutler like Bonzai Bob's use to do.  I was a fan when it was Bonzai Bob's and a fan now even though it's changed to Teriyaki Boy.  I've tried their steaks, chicken, and salmon bowls.  Everything I've tried has tasted fresh and flavorful.  But it's their brown rice that tastes amazing.  If you come here and get a bowl, try it will brown rice.  For some reason, it brings the flavor out of their meats.  My most recent meal was their salmon wrap w/extra meat.  This was good, not as good as their steak or chicken bowls, but good enough to sustain me for a few hours.  All their meals are price low. The most expensive item on the menu is currently $9.40.  But keep in mind that these prices are for their larger.  If you got your big boy pants on or need that extra extra protein, go for the Cutler Bowl which is about 48 oz of food (over 12 oz of meat). It will cost additional to go huge on their meals, but well worth it.  Plus, it's perfect for the next day's packed lunch or baon (for all you Pinoys). For an even better deal, try their \"Weekly Meal Plan\".  This will save you about $2 on each bowl, but this also means the same meal all week long which can be boring.  \n\nTo some, T-Boys is just another Teriyaki Madness or Samurai Sams.  Both taste and prices are similar.  But it's way more affordable than Greens & Protein when it comes to their chicken, steak, and salmon.  If you're hungry and looking for something on the healthier side, give T-Boys a try.  My suggestion...go big and get their Cutler Bowl.  \n\n\nPS:  There is a table reserved for Jay Cutler.

It had grilled chicken on top and some sauce covering the chicken. I was very unimpressed with the portion size for a $10 meal at a take out joint. The sauce was only okay but there was not enough of it to go around. The chicken was good but not anything more. The naan tasted like a spongy piece of blah.

The shrimp were quite tiny and very rubbery.   \n\nSince we got our meals for take out, I decided to call and speak to a manager to inquire about our concerns. The manager tried to tell me that they fill the boxes and the food settles about 1/3 of the way down the box. That's a lot of air in the food!

When I asked the woman behind the counter  ( lady with long black straight hair in ponytail working around 6pm) she quickly snapped at me and asked if I had specifically ordered my meal gluten free and then said that they had already made my meal so they would have to make another one for me.  Her tone and reaction caught me by surprise and I said that I thought I did order my meal gluten free, but not wanting to get the sweet cashier girl in trouble for keying my order incorrectly, I didn't make a big deal out of it. When my meal was finally ready, she handed it to me and rudely stated, \"next time make sure to ordered it gluten free, we had already made your meal and we had to make another one!\" Again shocked by her tone, I just stood there, my husband actually came over to defend me but by then I was just done.

While working at Weststar, a co-worker made a run to Chow King in he Seafood City store for lunch and told me that the halo-halo was really good. She got me the large one, for a little over $5- looks like a big gulp cup at 7-11. I didn't know it would be that big. Yup, I skipped dinner that night. It's big enough to share. It comes with a boba straw (wider than drink straws) and a long spoon. There is a small size available too.  \n\nI am picky about my Filipino food, but I do love many of the desserts. This is one of my favorites. Imagine many layers of toppings like corn, makapuno (young coconut strings), several kinds of beans, coconut gel squares (sweet), langka (sticky jackfruit- no other english translation), lime jello, interspersed with shaved ice and topped with a scoop of ube (purple yam) ice cream. I know that this combination might sound weird to a non-Filipino, but trust me, it really works. The beans and corn really balance out all the sweet stuff. You use the straw initially to drink the sweet purple-pink juice and once you get the cover off, you can mix it up as you eat it, using the spoon.

So do a search to read reviews on the other side. It has a totally different sentiment I assure you.\n\nI'm glad that Filipino foods are on the \"main stream\" now. Las Vegas definitely is not the place for it, despite many small Filipino restaurants popping out around the Chinatown here. This Seafood City mall was crowded with Filipino and Asian customers, and it was far away from Chinatown.\n\nThis was my first ever. And I was not impressed. Well, I was not impressed by looking at the menu. It looked too cheap of a Chinese foods, with Filipino names attached. I didn't bother to pay $$ to find out. Was that my lost? So I was not gonna say much about that.\n\nI did order the noodle trays, Bihon Guisado and Palabok, to go. A gamble. After all, this is Las Vegas. I thought I could get a good bargain.\n\nBefore I said more, I'd like to make a remark about the party trays. There were only 5 items available for $9.99 in this store. Other chains have more selections, with higher prices. And there were plenty heart attack choices... cheers to \"invincible\" obese Americans with no health insurance.\n\nOK. Back to the store. It posted that the party trays could feed up to 6. That's a bargain for $9.99, right!? When I placed the orders, the clerk warned me that it might only feed up to 5. OK! $9.99 for 5. Still not bad.\n\nBut I had my doubt when I saw the containers.\n\nWhat's next? Oh, I had to eat it first. The noodles and sauces were laid out nicely. The bihon guisado (with clear noodles, unless I've got something mixed up here) was very salty. Flavor was plain and boring. It's definitely an American dish. It tasted better when I added some boiled vegetables to dilute the salt and gave it a firm and crunchy texture.\n\nThe palabok was consisted of soft white rice noodles as the base. The sauce soaked and melted them so easily that I was kind of drinking and slurping the noodles down. I could not really taste the foods after everything blended so awfully together.\n\nBefore I finish, I'd like to point out that each food tray could easily fit into a take out Asian Styrofoam soup container. I could chow it down easily, especially the Palabok, in one meal.  And I don't eat a lot. Hehehehe...  (For reference, I could not finish a regular Lo Mein or Singaporean Fried Rice in one meal, and they are $7.99 or less usually, and they taste like foods)\n\nSo diners, it's American foods to me for these 2 Filipino dishes. Consider this is fast food in America, you may enjoy a heart attack. Is this a bargain? NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!\n\nBut I do hope that the quality and selection of Filipino fast foods in general will improve with time.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Although I'm not a big fan of Chow King food I will say this much, they're drinks are great.

Kinda like how that speedy Panda place is here in the US.  Some folks like to poke fun and call the place Cho King (get it?  Cho-king?) but I'll leave that up to you Jo Koy comedian types.  The food here is a mix of Chinese and Filipino dishes.  The common denominator?  Lots and lots of white rice on the menu!  Unfornately for me it's Jasmine rice, and I much prefer what many Hawaii people love, Calrose.  Can't make no solid musubi with Jasmine!\n\nChow King does breakfast, and also have their lunch & dinner menu daily.  Breakfast is eerily similar to that of Jollibee's.  They have the staple garlic fried rice, with an egg, and your choice of longanisa (gots to love that longanisa burp), beef tapa, or the King's special which is a combination of the two.  There's also congee for breakfast on the menu.  Classic, thick rice porridge.  Try the King's congee...it adds beef, meatballs, tripe, and a century egg (a very aged egg) on top!  Breakfast of champions!  Put some hair on that damn chest of yours!  Unless you're a lady.  Not sure if you need that.\n\nFor lunch and dinner, Chow King offers these lauriat meals.  They consist of rice, and noodles, with your choice of sweet sour pork, orange chicken, breaded fish, Shanghai egg rolls, or chicken.  They also have rice meals which basically have rice with a choice of main dishes like, fish, Oriental beef, orange chicken, honey garlic chicken, Chinese-style fried chicken, or a boneless bangus fish.  There's also fried rice on the menu, some have chorizo, one has beef, one has pork.  For side and snacks, Chow King has pancit, siopao, siomai, lumpia, and something called chicharap which is not unlike a fried shrimp chip.  See the mix here?  Some Chinese, some Filipino...all Chow King.  Eclectic, eh?\n\nFood's not bad.  It is a bit sauce heavy, and can be a bit salty for a lot of folks.  So drink your water, people!  Sorry, nightmare of Tony Horton screaming at me from P90X just flashed by.  It's definitely fast food, so don't go thinking you're getting an authentic Asian-inspired meal here.  It suits the American palette quite nicely.  For me, this will do in a pinch.\n\nBefore I forget, Chow King does serve dessert as well.  They got ube shakes, bubble teas, but their big seller is of course....Halo-Halo.  It's like the Filipino national dessert!  Their's is almost exactly like the one at Jollibee, topped with vanilla and ube ice cream.  And again, I wish there was more fruit, more shaved ice, and less sugar.  And I wish the price was cheaper too!  $5 is a lot to spend on one of these puppies.\n\nSo whether you call if Chow King or Cho King, this place is a welcome haven for well-traveled Filipinos.

From their chicken and fish dishes, to their breakfast items (which is served all day), to their snacks (steamed pork buns, etc), are all satisfactory to my taste buds.\n\nWhat I look forward to after eating an ok meal here are the desserts, which I think are a step up from other items. Their Halo-Halo (mix mix) is served in a what is large plastic container designed for drinks. You have to pretty much mix all the ingredients together to get the full flavor hence the name. I also get their Taho, which is silken tofu that sits on top of large tapioca or boba pearls encompassed with a dark sweet syrupy type liquid.\n\nFor those not familiar with Filipino cuisine, this place is not a bad place to start experiencing what your palette might like or not like.

I asked the waiter for some Go-ketchup as they claim they make their own sauce in house. Turns out what i thought was apricot preserves WAS the ketchup. Whoops. Why didnt i put the ketchup on my waffle to balance out the saltyness you may ask? i did, would have liked it with more syrup\n\nBBQ Ribs\n - forgot what the menu called them but these here damn tender to the bone which has me a bit worried that they were boiled first but even if it was oh well! great grilled flavor to sauce flavor ratio. Enough to split between two people without any awkward moments of gallantry.\n\nCheese Cake of Dreams\n - VERY interesting take on cheese cake, instead of an actual slice of cake or a square oc cake it was three scoops of cheese cake filling on a foundation of crumbled gram cracker crust. very interesting take on the traditional cheese cake.

The buns for the sliders were re purposed hot dog buns. I was not sure if I loved the buns or not, but the pork was awesome. I also tried the Ungyoza, which is a fusion of Gyoza and Ravioli. It tasted really good too. For dessert, I had the White Rabbit Roll, which was plated really cool (all the plates looked like they came off an episode of Iron Chef). It was really good (don't get me wrong), but I have some suggestions to improve this roll. Its extremely white and the sauce is really good, but add some classic ice cream like toppings to make it look more like a sushi roll.

Then we ordered a few tapas for both of us to share. \n\n1. Salad w/ Garlic Goma Dressing-- OMG! It was delicious! I daydream about that dressing all the time, wishing I could have it in a bottle for my own salads at home. It was recommended by our server. So good! \n\n2. Chef's Braised Belly-- You have to try this, definitely. I think there's one that comes with rice but we ordered just the belly. The sauce was sweet and tangy, not too salty. Came with more salad w/ garlic goma dressing, which I was extremely happy about.\n\n3. Gyoza-- They were very unique, shaped like raviolis. Sauce tasted similar to the braised belly, which I didnt mind since the belly was deeeelicous. \n\n4. Ribs & Chicken-- This was actually an entree. Ribs fell off the bone, chicken was tender and juicy.\n\n5. Shrimp Waffleyaki-- My boyfriend liked it. The sauce was spicy and yummy, which really made the dish amazing since you couldn't really taste the shrimp.\n\n6. 28Go Rice-- I wasn't a fan of it because of the seaweed mix but my boyfriend enjoyed it. I felt like it tasted too fishy? Idk, if you enjoy seaweed that way, (not nori topping), then by all means, go for it. \n\nI wish the table we had wasn't wobbly & the chairs were more comfy (back was way too slanted, you couldn't lean back).

The Thai tea itself tastes a bit different so I stirred the vanilla ice cream in there real well to mask the taste. I've had better but I appreciate this being on the menu. 3.5/5\n\nBelly Rice:\nTender braised pork belly served on steamed white rice with nori shreds and green onion on top. The sauce is sweet and tangy at the same time which cuts down the fattiness of the pork belly. 4/5\n\n28Salmon Poke Stack:\nFresh salmon cubes in sesame-soy blue agave nectar wasabi oil with seaweed salad, fried gyoza wrapper and greens. The dressing was mild and I think a little bit more of wasabi oil would make this dish pop. The fried gyoza wrapper added crunch. The salmon tasted fresh. 4/5\n\nGogi Beef Stuffed Waffle:\nBulgogi in a waffle folded in half served with syrup, 2 eggs and GOcatsup. Sweet bulgogi, sweet waffle. Very interesting combination. 4/5\n\n28GO Roll:\nPork belly, scallions wrapped in kimchee. Our server explained to us to start from bottom left to top right - mild to hot. You can barely taste the pork belly. But if you absolutely love kimchee, go ahead and try this dish. 3.5/5\n\nJ Dog: Kompleto:\nGrilled Kosher hotdog, kimchee, American cheese on a grilled hotdog bun. A little bit on the salty side. I think an Asian slaw would add the tang this was lacking to cut down the saltiness. 3.5/5\n\nTapas here are from $4-9.50. Entrees from $8.50-15.

It's mostly a take-out spot and does not offer much in the way of decor, but when I can get an entire sushi meal for $10.81 (haha, I go way too much), who cares?\n\nTheir fish is always fresh and the size of the pieces are just fine, especially for $1.  You can't complain.  I'm here 2x's a week on average and completely hooked.  I usually call on my way home, place my order, pick up, and go home to enjoy.  They now even have Tamari wheat-free soy sauce!  (on request)\n\nThey have a variety of specialty rolls as well that vary in price from $3 - $7.

Can ambiance and service compensate for sub par food at ridiculous prices? Oh, the dilemma! I like the beautiful decor and attentive service, but I also like reasonably priced entrees with discernable flavor. Let's see...nope. Well that didn't take very long to decide.\n\nI've eaten at this location several times. The last time was with a very large group of people, and I got to try many different things off the menu. It basically boiled down to two flavor categories: spicy or non-spicy. The spicy dishes tasted like they had been prepared in one stock sauce. The non-spicy dishes tasted like they had been prepared in a similar sauce that omitted the chili oil. Here and there they added other things, like black bean paste or some sweetness, but most of the dishes tasted pretty much the same. I suppose this is why the menu doesn't go into detail when describing the difference between entrees, just listing \"Mongolian Chicken\" or \"BC Hot and Spicy Chicken,\" since just the veggies and protein are interchangeable and no really strong flavor characterizes any one dish. \n\nWe started off with the appetizer sampler: Sesame Honey Chicken, BC Egg Rolls, Coconut Shrimp, and Pot Stickers. Everything was perfectly adequate and worth the price since it served 4 people. The chicken was crispy, sweet and sprinkled with sesame seeds. The egg rolls tasted like they had been fried in old oil, but I fixed that by dousing it in hot mustard. The coconut shrimp were thin, crunchy, and not too sweet. The pot stickers were steamed with a delicious pork filling, probably the best thing on the tray. It was all pretty good filler before the meal. But it's kind of a sad affair when the appetizers trump the actual main course...\n\nEverything came out really fast for a group of nine people and was piping hot. We shared it family style and here's the details, from best entree to worst:\n*Cantonese Noodles- Wicked fricken good! If I end up going again, I'm definitely ordering this dish. Shrimp, scallops, BBQ pork, chicken and Asian vegetables with wheat noodles tossed in a light but flavorful sauce.\n*Grilled Halibut- Well cooked and flaky. Mango and pineapple salsa was decent and the presentation was very well done.\n*Chicken with Asparagus- I was barely able to distinguish the black bean sauce it was supposedly cooked in, but the chicken was tender and the asparagus al dente. \n*BC Spicy Chicken- This falls under the 'spicy' category of food flavoring. It was a little spicy, a little sweet, and very generic. Supposedly their equivalent of 'Kung Pao,' but it tasted...weirder than any other Kung Pao I've had. \n*Mandarin Orange Scallops- Tough and overcooked, same flavors as the BC Spicy Chicken but with more sugar and no kick. The crispy spinach was interesting though.\n*Bamboo Bejing Duck- It was overcooked and dry rather than being crispy. The Asian pancakes were also dry, but the accompanying plum sauce lubricated things well enough. \n*Pad Thai Rice Noodles- Turned into a sticky noodle block after the first couple minutes. I've made the equivalent from a box in the 'Asian foods' aisle at Fry's. \n*Thai Curry Chicken and Shrimp- The Bamboo Club needs to focus on their Chinese offerings instead of their piss poor Thai dishes. Not good by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nThe side dishes were, like the appetizers, respectable but not amazing. The Dynasty Fried Rice tasted a lot like any other fried rice you'd order. No surprise or disappointment there. The Woked Mushrooms were very well cooked in a light sauce. Much better than most of the entrees even though it was a side dish. The Woked Asparagus had the same flavor as the mushrooms, both of which tasted suspiciously similar to the Chicken with Asparagus. Perhaps it just lacked the dollop of black bean paste?\n\nSo if you go, go for the ambiance. The patio is nice for Mill Avenue people watching and secluded enough to enjoy your meal with a little privacy. The service is attentive and quick to refill any glass or comply with your requests, even for a large group of people. At the very least these guys deserve the high tips generated by pricy entrees. It's too bad the food is so damn generic. Definitely not worth the 13-25 dollar price tag per entree. \n\nMaybe happy hour is the best option for attending this place? Cheap three dollar appetizers and drink specials without the unnecessary disappointment of crappy food? Maybe I'll give it a whirl in the future.\n\nIf you're wrangled into dinner there, go with the Cantonese noodles, crispy spinach and woked veggies. Best stuff on the menu. Or risk it and order something else. Maybe I went on an off night...but I doubt it since this is a corporate chain the same the country over.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 4, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "The atmosphere is nice.  I think both the food and drinks are a little overpriced for what it is but I know the rent down on Mill is marginally insane.  I've never had a wait here and the food comes out fairly quickly.  Occasionally I've had a server disappear for a while but that's the exception, not the rule.\n\nMy favorite things on the menu are the Crispy Crab Wontons which are served with a strawberry sauce instead of the more traditional sweet and sour, and the Drunken Monkey Flambe - which is somewhere between Bananas Foster and Cheesecake on fire.  They have a wide selection of specialty drinks but none of them really catch my imagination.\n\nThe food itself is ok, sort of like PF Changs upped their prices but didn't up the quality or presentation of their food.  This is a place I go because I'm meeting people who want to meet there, not necessarily a place I would ever choose.  The sad thing is that it's not because it's godawful.  It's really not bad.

It doesn't flambe because he accidentally puts the flame out with too much of the wine. Obviously, it wasnt nearly as exciting as we were hoping.

The waitress pointed through the glass window at a table and asked us to go on ahead of her and have a seat.  When we walked over to the table, it still had dirty dishes and glasses on it from the previous people.  We went ahead and sat down and waited for someone.  After 20 minutes, someone came out and asked if they could take our drink order and then started to clean the table.  As I was about to ask for tea, she stopped me and said they are having free beer and wine.  WOW, this will definitely make up for the dirty table.  She said she would send someone out to talk to us about what they were offering and she quickly left with the dirty dishes.  I stopped her before she could leave to ask if we could please get some water while we waited.  She nodded with a little frustration because she was obviously very busy.\n\nThirty minutes later she came back with water for us.  We had not seen anyone until now.  She filled our water glasses and asked us what we would like to order.  I went ahead and ordered our food, Pad Thai and Pad SeeEw Noodles, seafood.

She apologized and said she would send someone right out.  \n\nTwenty minutes later, a waitress carrying a plate came outside and was seeking the table the dish belonged to.  She was too far away to get her attention without yelling across the patio, so I waited to see if it was one of our dishes when she would come over our direction.  She asked the first few tables then went back inside.  I saw her ask another server inside and she pointed to us through the window.  When she arrived, it was our Pad Thai.  She put it down in front of us with 1 chop stick and quickly walked away.  Ater about five minutes, I looked atm y daughter and said we would go ahead and take turns because it was getting cold.  She was starving and so was I.  Not classy of us I know, but I figured it was a new business and wouldn't stop us from turning it into a funny moment to remember.\n\nAnother fifteen minutes later, the Pad SeeEw was brought out and the server quickly turned to walk away.  I stopped her and asked if we could get a second pair of chop sticks or silverware please.  She said OK and came right back with some.  We both took a bite and the seafood was not only undercooked, it was completely raw.  I love sushi, but this was beyond inedible.  I told her not to eat anymore of it and we both finished the Pad Thai.  \n\nIt was a new restaurant, so I figured they need to organize and we would try it again in a couple of months and laughed it off.  After waiting for a check for another twenty minutes, I told my daughter that I would teach her the proper way to complain, without being rude or inconsiderate.  It was a teaching moment.  I got up and sought after a server and asked for a check and told her the problem of the uncooked seafood.  She asked if we would please sit back down at our table and she would send over the manager.  I told her I wanted to pay for the Pad Thai only, and we really wanted to leave, but she insisted that we must talk to the manager.  Reluctantly we went back to our table and waited.  A few minutes later the manger came out and addressed the table next to us asking if they had a problem.  They said no, and I put my arm up and quietly said that was us.  He turned to us and asked what was wrong.  So I told him everything.  Again this was a teaching moment for my daughter on how to be polite, but complain.  After all, constructive criticism is a good way to learn and grow.  We figured we would try it again in a couple of months.  They just needed to work the \"bugs\" out.\n\nHe said ok when I told him and I asked him for the check for the Pad Thai.  He said one moment and walked away.  A few minutes later the bartender came out and asked the table next to us if they had a complaint for him.  They said no and looked at us.  Obviously, the manager sent him out.  Now we were embarrassed.  When he turned to us, we said no to him and he went in.  The original server came back out to us and handed us our check and said she had heard what we said and walked away.  We were both mortified and felt like we had acted inappropriately and ashamed.  The check was for $16.00+ for the Pad Thai.  I paid it, but was completely surprised that the manager didn't simply let us go with an apology and hope that we would give them a try again in a couple of months.

There is a green light trim (the previous restaurant was red-lit).  Right when we were seated, Chef Seonkyoung Longest (winner of Restaurant Express on Food Network) was making the rounds of every table and we were next!  She was so friendly and talked to us about her restaurant, and she showed so much pride.\n\nOur server was Doug and he is fantastic.  He was very friendly, informative, and personable.  We talked to him about dish sizes to make sure we were not over-ordering.  I started with a Yuzu Rita (yuzu juice, grand marnier, soju, simple syrup) rimmed with sea salt, and Eric R. had the Pacific mojito (in fact, 2 of them) AND jasmine green hot tea, which was by tea forte and in cute little pyramid infuser.  All of the serveware was very cool, with a theme of white wavy patterns.  The salt and pepper shakers were like puzzle pieces that fit together (our little marriage theme too, awww) and had white wavy patterns, the white napkins had this pattern across it, plates were rimmed with it, the tea pot also....soooo cute!  I liked it a lot!  Water glasses were stemmed jewel tone dark green which which was really cool and went with the green mood lighting.\n\nWe started with 2 apps, the duck sliders (5 spiced duck, cucumber, steamed bao with kaiware, cilantro and green onions to add) and Korean \"street tacos\" which was deconstructed: 3 scallion pancakes (wish there were 4!!!), bulgogi, cabbage in \"kimchi sauce,\" and shredded vegetables (radish, peppers) with sriracha-lime sauce.  Chef Longest stopped by to check on us after we had our apps.  We told her our entree is the bimibap, and she cheerfully told us that her mom came on opening night and approved of the bimibap (FYI: Chef grew up in Korea).  Apparently this was one of the top dishes from the show that she made.\n\nThe bimibap was served in a beautiful bowl with the egg perfectly poached easy on top, with a side of the sauce.  The server wanted to mix it up with the sauce but Eric R. tasted it and felt the slow burn in his non-spicy palate.  We declined and I just mixed it with the poached egg.  We then split it and then I added the sauce.  Everything was sooooo good.  I loved the shiitakes in the dish.\n\nNext, we ordered a little sushi: the Lady Luck Roll (salmon, tuna, hamachi on top, inside asparagus, gobo, avocado) and toro nigiri (3 pieces for $10, I think the 3rd was given to us for Eric R.'s birthday though).  The quality of the fish was excellent.  The maguro on the menu is bigeye and there is also blue fin tuna available.  For Eric R.'s birthday, he got a beautiful strawberry-white chocolate dessert with gold leaf on top that was just beautiful and delicious.  He loves both of those things so the restaurant nailed it.  However, the chef encouraged me to try the yuzu doughnuts because of my yuzu-love.  I guilted Eric R. into letting me get a 2nd dessert since he had 22 drinks and I had one.\n\nThe yuzu doughnuts came out pretty quickly.  They were described as yuzu-cream filled but they were actually not filled.  Also troublesome was the fact that they were room temperature.  I just expected warm to hot doughnuts.  They were just like room temperature dough drizzled with yuzu cream and topped with chopped pistachios.  The cream was fine (not as yuzu-y as the drink) but the temperature of the doughnuts just did not work.  Eric R. actually asked one of the chefs walking back toward the kitchen about it, and he immediately said they are supposed to be room temperature because otherwise the sauce would break.  I guess I personally didn't like it but other people might.  Just get the yuzu rita!!\n\nOverall, service is great, the Chef is really enthusiastic, the ambiance is nice, and the food is excellent.

The prices are also very reasonable. We decided to get different items from the menu and just share it. \n\nChicken Lettuce Wraps ($8) - These were pretty good. I personally prefer a crunchier lettuce, but it was good. The menu said this dish was spicy however there wasn't any kick to the dish all. The chicken still had good flavor and it is worth the price. It came with 3 lettuce cups and when I asked our server for more it was no problem.\n\nCashew Chicken ($15) - My favorite dish of them all! It was a great portion of chicken and put over white rice it was perfect. There were plenty of cashews and this is a dish I would probably order every time. \n\nGochujang Pork ($15) - Apples are in this dish, but I didn't taste them. That's OK because whatever flavor it did give the pork, I loved! I will say that this was also supposed to be a spicy dish and there was again no kick at all. It's sort of frustrating when a dish says it will be spicy and it isn't, but it did have great flavor and I would eat it again. As with the other dishes it was a decent portion. \n\nHoney Walnut Shrimp ($18) - I don't eat seafood. I didn't try these! The menu says it was supposed to have a creamy mayo sauce, but hubby said the shrimp tasted more like a really sweet orange and wouldn't order them again. I thought they were presented well and nicely sized. \n\nYuzu Doughnuts ($7) - These are yummy! The doughnuts are very light and not greasy at all. The doughnuts were filled with tasty yuzu glaze and more glaze with pistachios were on top. The refreshing citrus flavor and light texture of the doughnuts made for a nice dessert. \n\nThey didn't open until 5 pm (when we happened to arrive) and people were already waiting to get in.

The Shrimp/Veg Tempura was also delicious and everything in this dish was very fresh as well and was not over done with the breading.\nThen came the Korean Tacos and the M Girl Rolls.  The flavors for each of the ingredients were very well done and complemented each other impeccably, and the sauce that came with the tacos was scrumptious. In addition the \"tortillas\" used were so light and fluffy that you could eat these all night and not get full from the bread. I was worried about trying the M Girl Rolls since there were jalape\u00f1os in the roll since I can't do many spicy foods. However you couldn't feel the heat from the jalape\u00f1os and it really just added to the flavor of the rolls.\nSome of the main courses included the Emperor Fried Rice and Gochujang Pork.

Seems more substantial than the Spicy Tuna roll. Definitely offers more flavor, yet fairly well balanced. \n\nKorean Street \"Tacos\" : some assembly required. decent appetizer dish. that sauce is amazing. Don't expect to be filled with this. 3 \"tortillas\" only.\n\n5 Spiced Duck Sliders: Two small bao. intensely flavored. seems there is an addition of some sort of wine to the ingredient list. that particularly stuck out at me.\n\nKimchi fried rice: Likely the highlight of the dinner. Pleasantly spicy, rich tasting. The rice has a sort of \"doneness\" that makes it slightly \"crisp\" so that it sticks a little bit to your molars when you're munching away at it. \n\nThe Service:\nNo problems. Food arrived in an appropriate amount of time. Seemed typical to me. Fairly attentive.\n\nThe Ambiance:\nMildly noisy.

I didn't follow the tv show Restaurant Express but saw snippets of Chef Longest making some dishes that sounded yummy! \n\nOur first server was also one of the contestants .. Eric??..sorry I didn't watch the show..but he mentioned that he was with Chef Longest on the show. He was very enthusiastic and went over the menu page by page with us. Answered our questions and gave his suggestions as well. \n\nThere was a good representation of Korean, Chinese and Japanese inspired offerings. Even the desserts sounded so good! When I saw they had Green Tea Brulee, I told Mr. B I wanted that for dessert!  The prices were really reasonable. Most plates under $10.  The specialty dishes are couple dollars more ie $30 for 1 1/2lb for lobster.  That's heck inexpensive for me..(esp since Im used to paying $$) You cant go wrong with that!  \n\nIt's tapas style. Small plates meant to be shared so the portions served are just right. So we could easily try all kinds of different dishes. They took our orders and spread out the order  so everything brought to our table was hot, and we got to take our time and pace ourselves since we ordered alot of food.  We ended up having a total of 11 items. \n\n2 Specialties: Korean Style Lobster & Chinese Lemon Chicken\n2 Soups & Noodles: Mandarin Beef Noodle Soup & Chow Fun\n2 Appetizers: Duck Sliders & Chicken Lettuce Wraps\n2 cocktails- Asian inspired with Pomegranate and Watermelon liqueurs\n3 desserts --yes three... Strawberry Yuzu White Chocolate Mousse, Banana Egg Rolls, Green Tea Brulee  which was a surprise!  They gave me a complimentary dessert for my birthday! My server heard me saying I wanted it...very attentive!!\n\nThe standouts and faves -  The Mandarin Beef Noodle Soup & Korean Style Lobster.\n\nI digged the Lobster dish! You are served the whole shebang! Body, legs,the tail. Sherry Soy was the sauce and  ginger was the prominent flavors I tasted.  It was tossed with some veggies but I didn't really bother with them, I was too busy digging for lobster meat, which was succulent, tasted fresh, high quality. That good! \n \nThe broth in the beef noodle soup is delicious! I .loved the herbs and spices in it. The flavors gave the beef broth  alot of depth, I want to say star anise is in it. It was so fragrant. Totally enjoyed the soup and would order it again. \n\nMr B.s fave was the Chow Fun, I tried some, the beef is really tender. The flavors in all the appetizers we tried we both enjoyed. The only dish I probably would pass up next time is their lemon chicken.  It is very good flavoring wise, but we prefer breading that's more on the crispy side. The breading texture wise, was a little too thick for me. \n\nDesserts - I'd go again with the Strawberry Yuzu White Chocolate Mousse and Green Tea Brulee. These desserts have the right amount of sweetness and are light.  The banana chocolate eggrolls are good as well if you want a more rich, decadent chocolate treat. \n\nService & Atmosphere -  Very nice set up! A touch of class and elegance, yet casual enough where you don't have to wear formal attire. \n\nService was OUTSTANDING! From the minute we were greeted at front by the hostess and manager to the team of servers. Reservations were made via Opentable and when we arrived we were seated right away.  I have a  preference noted on my Opentable profile for window seating. The hosts saw that and I was given the table in the VIP area since it was the one with a view available. Very nice too, it's separate from the main dining area. \n\nAlso servers were very attentive. When I pointed out to Mr. B.

The portions were smaller than i'm used to but the flavor of everything was superb! This is what we ordered:\n\nKorean Lobster-This dish reminded me of many chinese type dishes i've had in the past with the usual ginger and soy sauce base flavor but i love how they added a twist by making it korean, as it's name, by adding some korean pork, spices and veggies. There wasn't that much lobster pieces but in other restaurant dishes....they really isn't in the first place. I would definately eat this again...but maybe next time i'll order two for just myself..oink oink!\nPork Wrap-This was a fancy upgrade to what i'm used to, Samgyupsal (korean name for it). It tasted the similar but again with special additional ingredients.  Nice appetizer instead of just a salad. They give you four pieces. \nKalbi Rib-This was sweeter than the normal kalbi i'm used to. The beef quality was great but i wasn't really digging the extra sweetness. You can definately taste the kalbi that you usually eat but with a thicker teriyaki like sauce. I would've like them to have brought this out with white rice or something to neutralize the sweetness.\nKimchee Fried Rice-This was my absolute favorite of the dishes! OMG it's just like mom makes it but this extra spice/seasoning that kicks you to want more in your mouth. CRACK would be a better word. More please?!?!?!?!?\n\nSince it seems like they have mostly korean dishes, i wish the name and decor was more \"korean\" themed though.They have the green for chinese and the cherry blossoms for japanese......Oh well maybe later if they ever remodel. =)", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "If I could give no stars I would... just because you call it fusion doesn't make it acceptable to butcher 3 main Asian culinary genres.

There were some things that we're pretty good and other things that were just pretty bad.  The AYCE includes (1) super extra small Carafe of sake (enough for 2 regular sake cups) per person, (1) miso soup per person and their very limited menu includes about 8 roll selections (optional handroll) and 8 Nigiri selection.  \n\nI had 1 spoonful of the miso soup and I pushed it away.  The shiitake mushroom was from dehydrated mushroom which is normally fine however they didn't rehydrate it enough so it that rough chewy texture.    The carafe of sake that is part of the price is valued at $20 (this is the price stated specific on their advertisement around the casino).  Yet the waitress said the sake carafe for that size is $10 if we wanted to purchase additional sake.  \n\nThe rolls we did order from the AYCE menu weren't all bad.  What I didn't like was that they had common rolls (California roll, Spicy Tuna roll, and Spyder roll) as part of this already limited AYCE Menu.  The Nigiri were huge and not the best quality.  You can see from the texture, taste and smell of the fish in the roll and nirgi wasn't up to par as they advertise on the M resort Chef's quote that they fly the best quality in daily.  The already questionable fish and soft shell crab didn't go any better with the burnt plastic smell from their torch the sushi chefs were using.  \n\nSERVICE:\nHostess - when we first got there, there was 1 person waiting already and a few couples arrived after we got there.  There was a line and no hostess... great start!  When the hostess finally arrived she ignored the first guest until I told her speak to her first since she was here first.  When we were getting seated it really bothered me that she didn't ask if we wanted to eat at the bar or not, she just automatically sat us there.  \n\nWaitress - she was nice enough but she didn't know how to approach guest.  She would serve between the guests of the same party when there were vacant seats around.  I mean, who wouldn't want to be elbowed while getting a water refill? \n\nSushi Chef - they were polite and very accommodating when my husband wanted to make the nirigi into a hand roll.

Places like Yama or Kaizen have 30+ rolls to choose from in all varieties of wackiness.  Jayde has about 10 and they're all pretty standard.\n\nOne of the standout rolls was the humble california roll.  At this point we're so used to having average california rolls that getting a good one really took us by surprise.  Another tasty surprise was the Surf & Turf roll - a spicy tuna roll with seared kobe on top.  One major negative of this roll is that the kobe was seared on the roll with a blowtorch and you can definitely taste the butane flavor.
