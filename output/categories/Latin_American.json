The tortilla's are made fresh and they are great! If your not a salad person, get the chicken or shredded beef enchilada (1 is enough for me) with medium sauce and double rice. I also get a small side of ranch to go on my salad garnish along with a large side of the medium enchilada sauce. Ranch and the enchilada sauce make for a goupy rice but it taste awesome! A couple things I dont recommend to get: Anything with the sweet pork, this is just personal preference for me because I think its a bit too sweet and overpowering but if you like sweet meat, you will probably like it. Also, the shrimp taco's with mango salsa are nothing impressive and the nachos are nothing great either.

Personally, I think it's a wash: Costa Vida does a few things better and a few things worse.\n\nAt Costa Vida, you have the option of ordering hard tacos, a burrito, a bowl, or nachos. Once you've decided the basic configuration, the real fun begins. You pick one of four meats, one of two different beans, one or more of the numerous salsas, and whatever you want of the standard toppings. They really pile things on here, which is a definite plus, and that makes the food here a pretty good deal. On the other hand, not all the options are wonderful. The tacos are noticeably smaller portions than the other options and the chips in the nachos often turn to mush under the wetter toppings. Of the salsas, several are tasty, but none of them appropriately spicy. But, that may actually appeal to you.\n\nI think what's going to make it or break it for you with Costa Vida is how well you like the much lauded sweet pork. Everything else at Costa Vida is pretty unadventurous and safe; the sweet pork is really what sets this place apart. Basically, it's slow cooked pork, shredded up in a very sweet reduction that I would bet money is made out of a cola. The meat is very tender, but I found the sauce to be rather cloying, almost syrupy. I've heard it described as being like a dessert, and I don't think that is very far off. Some people love it, but I couldn't do it. It was just too sweet and an odd complement to the cheese, sour cream, lettuce, tomato, etc. To me, it the sweet pork seems like a better fit for a Southern restaurant. \n\nIf it sounds like you may like this sweet pork, give the place a shot. There is often a big line to get food, but this is an efficiency kitchen and they handle rushes with aplomb. I found the dining area awfully loud and uncomfortably packed, but the seating outside alleviates most of that. Still, it's a little hectic for me, especially since I'm not impressed by the food.

Even if you're not hungry, there are several fantastic drinks that you'll find here that are unavailable anywhere else in Madison. If you wondered what kissing Scarlett Johansson is like (or George Clooney should you be a lady), the Jamaican Iced Tea w/ rum is as close as you're going to get. The best way to describe the array of food here is somewhere between Mexican and Cajun. And should you feel the urge, the chocolate rum cake alone will give you a buzz, if not from the sugar, than the rum that it's soaked in.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Tight space but great food.

Our main waitress took our order etc but then the hostess and some other girl would keep coming around too and ask if we needed more water etc literally like 3min after our main waitress had checked on us.  Seems like they need better delegation of jobs so they aren't all doing the same thing.  \n\nThe drinks were strong and the dessert was stronger.  A good drink doesn't mean overpowering alcohol.

I had the pork which was incredibly tender and the rice side was really tasty.  I don't know what kind of dressing was on the salad but it was really good.  If you don't like overly strong drinks you'd better tell them that ahead of time.  \n\nOverall, as I said, it was a really nice evening.

It actually tasted excellent, however a large number of the mangos in the salad still had the inedible mango skin on, which seemed to me to be a careless mistake.  The dressing had great flavor and wasn't too heavy.  At $9 without tax or tip, this was a fairly expensive salad.  The portion was also small and I so I left feeling hungry.\n\nThe second meal I had was their hearty beef soup.  The flavors of the soup were initially excellent.  However, as I dug into the bowl, I found several beef bones, as well as a number of pieces of charred/blackened/burned meat.  There was literally a large piece that was probably about a square inch with a 1/4\" thick burned crust on it.  It just seemed like careless cooking.  At $11 for a bowl that was relatively small, I again was hungry after eating.  The waiter seemed particularly enthusiastic about the beans, and I was still hungry, so I ordered a side.  $2.25 seemed like a high price to pay for a side of beans and it certainly was given how small the side was.  The beans tasted very standard and unoriginal.\n\nThe service I received during both of my meals (from the same tall, lanky waiter) was abysmal.  The restaurant was empty, but the service was slow.  I had to actually ask him for a menu at one of the meals and had to ask to receive water at both meals.  I also found myself having to ask multiple times to receive a water refill.  When my waiter was not at the table, I could hear him loudly conversing with a female cook in back.  They talked about a number of inappropriate things and also argued over which music should be played.  This led to a very eclectic mix of music, including songs that were cut off midway through.  The volume was extremely loud and would occasionally be turned up louder for portions of the song that the staff were apparently particularly fond of.   \n\nOverall, there are some fun flavors going on at this restaurant, but high prices, small portions, careless cooking/preparation, and an incompetent wait staff really ruined it for me.

While we were waiting for our food the previously missing waitress stumbled in and seemed really confused. That was the start of awkwardness with her.

I reviewed the menu options online before our visit and had a couple Peruvian-influenced items in mind when we walked through the doors.  However, the restaurant now describes itself as a \"Mexican Grill\", so it was time for a quick change of plans (note to management - please update your online menu).\n\nAfter seating us, our server dropped off a basket of standard-grade corn chips and a bowl of pico de gallo.  The chips were heavily salted and were nothing to write home about.  The pico de gallo was excellent - it was loaded with fresh onions, cilantro and tomatoes along with a healthy dose of jalapenos.  My only problem with it was the bowl was too small and every time we tried to use a chip to scoop some out, most of the contents ended up on the table.  Because of this, we soon ran out of pico de gallo, but our server was too engrossed with a cell phone call to notice that we needed a refill.  \n\nAfter adjusting to the new menu, I decided about the beef version of the Cemita Poblana sandwich ($10).  The sesame-encrusted bun was a disappointment; it had the texture of a hamburger bun from the local Piggly Wiggly.  Also disappointing was the beef cutlet - too little beef and far too much of the greasy breading.   I did enjoy the rest of the sandwich, which included loads of buttery oaxaca cheese, slightly sweet caramelized onions, spicy chipotle peppers and perfectly ripe avocados.  \n\nThe $7 cheese quesadilla ordered by my daughter became a comedy of errors.  She is a vegetarian and the first version of her cheese quesadilla was peppered with small chunks of chicken.  We flagged down another server (our initial server was still busy on his cell phone) who apologized for the error and promised to make a cheese-only version.  It came ten minutes later, but this time, the thick corn tortilla was a soggy mess.  (I wonder if it sat on the counter too long, since the first quesadilla did not have this problem.)  The replacement quesadilla also lacked a serving of the salsa verde that added some much needed zip to this dish.  We again flagged down a server, and after another wait, we received the green salsa.  By then the whole thing was getting cold - ugh.  While my daughter did enjoy the melted oaxaca cheese, she stated she strongly preferred the $3 Los Gemelos version of this dish.  With no sides, this dish was a poor value.\n\nThe interior of the restaurant was extremely clean, flooded with natural light and nicely decorated.  \n\nOverall, the negatives of my visit (spotty service, lackluster food) outweighed the positive (superb pico de gallo).

As a Californian, I am in a constant quest for good Latin/Mexican food, so when the car was unloaded we decided to wander down and check this place out.\n\nThe restaurant is small and cute.  It was hosting a large party of partially intoxicated women celebrating a 40th birthday who provided some excellent people watching between courses.  I think this would be a fun place to come with a big party as they serve cocktails (margaritas... yummmmm) in big pitchers and the space is well setup for it.\n\nWe had our drinks order taken within minutes of sitting down, which was a definite plus, and the margaritas were the best I've had in Edinburgh, another big plus.  The big negative was that despite asking several times, we were never brought water, which we found very odd.  \n\nWe shared a starter of nachos.  I remember being impressed at the salsa, which tasted home made.  They also came with black beans which were a very tasty addition.\n\nMy guy ordered a dish which I kind of remember so I just went to the website to look it up but the menu tab takes me to a page that says MENU, and nothing else.  Er... I remember it was something which they called traditionally Venezuelan, and it was nice.  It was different, which is something I always enjoy.  \nI ordered their \"famous\" fajitas.  I have had great fajitas all over Edinburgh and I do love them sooo much.  I realise they're not sexy or unusual, but man they are tasty.  I loved the char-grilled tastiness that was cooked into the chicken and the veggies.  BUT they fajitas were, as they always are, served with sour cream, guacamole, and salsa.  I've already commented on how I liked the salsa, so I was shocked at the guac and sour cream.  \nThe guacamole tasted like it was Tesco value guacamole.  Fine for a pub, but not fine for a Latin American restaurant.  It was green, but I'm really not sure it even had avocados in it.  My boyfriend argued that avocados are expensive and this place probably couldn't afford to make their own guac, but I think it's an expense which is necessary for a Latin American restaurant.  \nThe sour cream was even more disappointing.  I'm a huge fan of sour cream so was surprised when I wasn't tasting the tangy wonderfulness which I love so much.  I stuck my finger in it to taste it plain and was shocked to discover that it was cream, heavy cream.  In addition to loving sour cream, I bake.  A lot.  I know what cream tastes like, and that was cream.\nWhen the waiter came to take our plates our exchange went like this:\nHim:  So how was everything?\nMe:  It was great!  We're stuffed!  But I just have to ask... (smile) did you run out of sour cream tonight (big smile) ?\nHim:  I'm sorry?\nMe:  (smile) I was just wondering if you ran out of sour cream, because that's actually cream\nHim: No it's not.\nMe:  Oh, ehm... it really didn't  taste like sour cream to me\nHim: Well it is, but I will ask the kitchen.\nMe: Thanks... oh and can we get our bill please?\n\nA few minutes later the waiter came back to assure me that it was indeed sour cream, and was then never to be seen again.\n\nWe sat for about 15 minutes trying to catch someone's eye to bring us the bill, before we just stood up and went directly to the counter to pay.  \n\nSo, I'm left with really mixed feelings about this place.

They're not in a convincing trompe l'oeil style, instead being intentionally slightly cartoonish. The effect is actually better, because first of all trying to make them convincing is never going to work and could just be tacky, and secondly the bright colours are so lively that it has the same kind of energy level as an actual window. It tricked my brain without tricking my eyes - very smart!\n\nNow on to the food. I had the chilli mushroom starter, which was simply divine and I could have eaten four portions of it as a main. This was followed by chicken fajitas, Venezuelan style: wayyy less hot and spicy than the Mexican tradition, and the onions and peppers were less heavily fried, still having a considerable amount of bite and crunch. It was really nice, especially with the addition of what I called the traffic light of deliciousness - three little dishes containing salsa, sour cream and guacamole. A nice touch, too, was that the tortillas were served in a little plastic lidded pot marked \"tortilla\" to keep them warm and soft.

Similar to Mexican gorditas, pupusas are thick tortilla corn pockets filled with different combinations of cheese, meat (pressed pork rinds), loroco (an edible flower, tastes like asparagus), zucchini, and beans. Rebueltas are the most popular (meat, cheese, and beans), my favorite are zucchini and cheese. \n\nThis specific location is really nice because it's newer and very clean. They future a large glass display window there you can watch where the pupusas are being freshly made. They are served with curtido (pickled cabbage with oregano and other spices) which is delicious.

Don't be fooled, the horchata is very different from the Mexican one. To me it tasted like burned rice but they have many other drinks to pick from.

The masa they use for the pupusas is prepared by bare hands. I know this because I watched everything go down through their open glass wall looking directly into their kitchen. I saw the lady touch the handle of her spatula with her masa-soaked hands leaving it sticky. I then watched as the front register lady (who touches the money) used the spatula to flip a pupusa. Then the masa lady touched the spatula again and again. This is only one offense I will mention. \n\nI would have been more forgiving if I saw even one person, in the hour that I was there, wash their hands. The sink remained unused the whole time.

They come with just about anything you can imagine inside them. There are veggie-friendly options as well, as my friend is a vegetarian and she got a pupusa with cheese and zucchini. I ordered two pupusas: shrimp and cheese, and a chicken and cheese. I also asked if we could have some tortilla chips while we waited for our food. The waitress immediately brought out some chips (complete with red sauce and a nice cheese topping on them). While we munched on the chips some children ran around the restaurant and I was delighted to see that this place is run by *ahem*non-white people*ahem*. \n\nWe got our food to go and walked back over to the bar.

The chicken one was good too, but the shrimp... so fantastic. It was cooked perfectly! I am in love with pupusas now. I wish I had been eating them all along!

This IS they reason why you would go here! As you approach the front entrance of Cana, you'll be greeted by a couple of fine-lookin' and friendly hostesses who will escort you down a corridor with a Wine display along the whole length of the corridor... Then the aroma of Sugar Cane just envelopes you... the Sweet, Succulent, just Intoxicating scent of Sugar Cane.... Every mixed drink has Sugar Cane mixed in along with Rum... so you cannot evade Drinks mixed with Sugar Cane. Just an aside... I found out later that the restaurant produces their own Sugar Cane Syrup used for the Drinks... unlike other restaurants that uses refined Syrup.\n\nMenu - in chronological order...\n\nGuava Glazed Short Ribs (**** 1/2 $12.00) The flavor on these Ribs are of a slightly Sweet Guava Glaze... the meat melts in your mouth ( I am not kidding! )... When we divided the dish between my partner and myself, the meat interior was a perfectly cooked Medium to Medium Rare with it being on the Medium Rare side. If anything... the Short Ribs could have been Spicier, but that's an attribute that is not found in a Spanish derived entree... Maybe, it's my Mexican foodie hot-as-hell influence...\n\nLamb Chops in a Mint Chimichurri (***** $14.00) Probably the best overall value among the Bocadillos (translated to Small Plates) served in Cana. Three Lamb Chops, like the Short Ribs, cooked to a Medium to Medium Rare consistency with a line of Mint Chimichurri along the length of the white ceramic plate. A very fine value.... I just had this recently in California at an upscale Mexican restaurant... same price with only two cuts of Lamb Chops. I was thinking while I ate.... this should be more in line if priced at $16.00 for the plate...\n\nOverall, I like how the Meat is prepared at Cana... with just enough Fat left on the Meat, whether it be the Short Ribs or Lamb Chops to provide some tenderness and flavor.... especially FLAVOR!\n\nScallop Ceviche with Mango, Pomegranate Seeds, and Mint (***** $12.00) On a rectangular ceramic plate you'll receive very fresh and tender Sliced Scallops along the length of the plate, with chunks of Mango and Pomegranate Seeds sprinkled on the Scallop Slices. This Ceviche, which was the only one I ordered (because my partner has an aversion to Seafood - Dang It!) was the most visually appealing entree amongst those ordered last night. With the exception of one person who I can't name right now... I can't think of anyone that will NOT be satisfied with this Ceviche!\n\nBeef Empanadas with Piquillo Pepper and Avocado Crema (***** $10.00) Actually, the Empanadas came out later than the next entry... and I'll tell you why the review for the Empanadas came first... \n\nLiterally, an Empanada can be defined as a Stuffed Bread or Pastry... and Cana's version tends more towards the Pastry attribute. The neutrality of the Pastry Shell was so delicate and flaky and soft that the whole Empanada just melted in your mouth. Reminded me of a Pastry I would find at a Bakery or at a Chinese Dim Sum restaurant. .... It IS that Soft and Delectable!\n\nCorn Dogs - Chorizo with a Tangerine / Habanero Mustard (*** 1/4 $10.00) Probably the most disappointing Bocadillo ordered. The Empanada, which came after the Corn Dog... had me wishing that the Pastry Crust around the Empanada also surrounded the Corn Dog. I did not order this... blame it on my partner....\n\nThe Chorizo with the Patry Crust would sound dang fine right about now...\n\nYucca Fries with Garlic Aioli (**** $6.00) How can you say.... Spanish GARLIC FRIES! That's what this entree is! But, the Garlic is in the Aioli Dip not on the Fries itself. Very attractive presentation in a metal paper-lined Belgian Fries-like container.\n\nAfter conversing with the waiter, Jason, it's recommended that one consume this Bocadillo within five or six minutes as the Yucca hardens rather quickly. Jason stated that the Chef was seriously considering taking this off the menu because of that. My opinion, if it matters is.... just warn the customers beforehand... \n\nIf this matters, Yucca is often compared to Viagra... not kidding! Keep it on the menu just for that!\n\nMango Mojito (***** ???) This Mojito was the most authentic I've had. I come from a very small town... and none of my previous experiences with Mojito ever tasted this good. Contained the required Mint Leaves... about four or five, and the slices of Lime. I could have consumed a half-dozen of these babies....\n\nSweet Tea (***** ???) Cana's version of Long Island Iced Tea... As everyone probably knows by now... Long Island Ice Tea is the \"Every Liquor, including the Kitchen Sink\" of Mixed Drinks. But, Cana's version, of course, includes Rum and the obligatory Sugar Cane. \n\nSummary: Fine looking staff - men and women with great views of the Town Center Courtyard.

They market themselves as a ceviche place, and the ceviche is terrible. \n\nThis was my experience. I called in the afternoon to make a dinner reservation, and I was told I don't need one. Should've been a red flag. After much persistance, I convinced the host to just reserve me a table anyway. When I arrived, my party wasn't there yet, so I took my table because the bar was full. I wasn't offered a beverage for quite some time. \n\nWhen my friends arrived, they received warm water with no ice in a sticky glass. My sangria took a very long time to make. We ordered 3 dishes after waiting quite some time for our waitress. After about 20 minutes, the waitress told us that the chef had just informed her they were out of salmon... We were starving! Did she wait 20 minutes to put in the order? People around us were getting food. \n\nThe first dish to arrive was mini chorizo corn dogs. Flavor was terrible, no spice at all. The texture was even worse. Next we received the item that we substituted for the salmon, which was a crab ceviche. Completely over salted, and was more like tuna than crab. \n\nFinally our 3rd dish arrived, the hirame ceviche. When the waitress described it to us, she mentioned it was the special of the night which came with a salad. There was no salad. No greens. Nothing. This one was at least slightly tasty compared to the others, but it wasn't amazing. I contemplated dessert, but couldn't justify giving this establishment another cent. \n\nI was very glad that some of the people I was planning to dine with couldn't make it.

So, when I saw this place in Town Square I had to check it out.\n\nFirst of all, there are 2 entries for Ca\u00f1a on yelp. Both refer to the same place but one has the address wrong. The correct address is 6599 Las Vegas Blvd. I'm posting my review under both.\n\nNow for the review... Ca\u00f1a is located in the spot vacated by Louis's Fish Camp and they did a great job of remodeling the space. Louis's had a small bar and the entry way was a little odd -- kinda felt like you were walking in through the back door to get into the restaurant because of the small door, walking by the bathrooms and getting a glimpse of the \"behind the bar\" area before getting to the dining area. With Ca\u00f1a, the doorway is larger and more inviting and the bar is pushed back, adjoining the patio areas. The interior of the place is much darker and intimate as well. The bathrooms are in the same location but are not as pronounced.\n\nAs for the food... ehh... it was ok but not great.  Not even \"really good\" either.\n\n- Hamachi ceviche -- as other reviews have mentioned they are not traditional ceviches. They're more like sashimi slices laying on a streak of citrus sauce. Hardly enough citrus to 'cook' the hamachi. It didn't taste all that fresh and lacked flavor.\n\n- Short ribs -- one large short rib in a deep pool of guava glaze. The meat was very tender but didn't have much depth in flavor. A few more spices would have given it some kick and made this a great dish, but the meat all on its own was a little dull.\n\n- Piggy back dates -- It seems like every tapas/bocadillos place HAS to have bacon wrapped dates. I guess I should be glad that this place did, because it was the best dish of the night. Great textures (although the amount of goat cheese mousse was overkill) and great flavors.\n\n- Beef empanadas -- the outside of the empanadas was flaky and a little crispy. The inside could have used more beef. Almost every bite was pastry with a hint of beef. The beef tasted pretty good, I just wanted more of it.\n\n- Crispy shrimp -- decent flavor, not as crispy as I would have liked.\n\n- Sangria -- while it did taste good, it wasn't strong enough and was too sweet. It wasn't what I was expecting.\n\nWe sat at the bar on a Saturday night and didn't have any trouble finding seats. The service was very good. Our bartender was on top of things and we didn't have to wait long for drinks or food even though he and the other bartenders were very busy (all those mojitos take a while to make). Our bill came out to about $88 including tip for two people... not bad. However, I doubt I'll be back for the food.

I know we all love those sugary mojitos at Firefly, but the flavorings are all just powders and artificial. The fruit mojitos here are muddled with real fresh fruit - they used a half pint of blueberries on one freaking mojito that I watched them make! I much prefer real fruit to powdered mixes, but to each his own.\n\n*Service is exponentially better. The bartenders will actually take the time to get to know you and make sure you love your drink. My mojito gets thrown at me with no hello at FireFly\n\n*Atmosphere. I love the sexy lounge/patio they have going! Happy hour is till 7, instead of ending at 6 PM like it does on FF on Paradise. \n\n--------------------------\n\nI've said it once and I'll say it again - the drinks are awesome and they are why I come here. The mojitos are muddled with fresh fruit, and they have some awesome martinis. I do have to give the edge to Firefly on the sangria, however. They only have one kind at Cana and it's just oK.\n\nWe've tried half the menu and love nearly everything we've tried. I think the low point is sadly  the ceviche. We tried their best selling yellowtail ceviche and while it was fresh, I don't like their funky new style. If I want ceviche I want small pieces of fish, not 4 huge ugly slabs. It was sloppy and uninspired imo.\n\nOn the flip side, we really loved the beef empanadas. They aren't traditional, but wow the puff pastry dough is good. The mac and cheese is great as are the sliders. The flat breads and shrimp are both great and hearty portions to boot. I think our favorite was the short rib. A pretty damn big slab for $12 and covered in the most delicious sauce. \n\nIf you're a Firefly regular - give it a try. It's more sophisticated and the drinks are way better!

It was 5pm.  Now I am really pretty good about determining what is high quality food and drink and I am so glad to find a place that cares to creatively design and present items in BOTH categories on their menu.\n\nThat's why got Cana 5 stars.. wonderful creative food items and tasty unique handcrafted cocktails.

I thought it was a little expensive but when I think about spending less at another place I also think about how much I loved Cana... then I just drive back to Town Square and Cana.\n\nCorey (the owner) came by and gave me some information that made me seriously consider becoming a regular. They don't have walk ins because they insist on fresh ingredients.  They make their own sugar syrup for drinks out of raw sugar vs processed.  The Pisco drinks use different brands of Pisco and he can describe the subtle flavors of each type.  It's not a franchise or corporate owned.  And the best part...wait for it..... they create specials weekly and change about a third of the menu to keep up the creativity factor.. then he brought out the chef who is young and really passionate about his creations.. THEN to top it off Corey sent out an order of the Churros (think puff pastry, crispy outside, soft inside, the best cinnamon sugar ever drizzled with a warm vanilla sauce) on the HOUSE!!! Stick a fork in me..I'm done.  \n\nOk, not really done.\nHere's a list of what we tried (using the website as a reference cuz there is no way I can remember it all!).\n\nSnapper Ceviche-sour orange, lime, super fresh fish\nHamachi Ceviche-the yuzu really enhanced it\nCrab Ceviche-actually a large portion of crab that looked like all claw\nBig Eye Tuna Flatbread-this dish was kept simple to let us really taste the tuna and the presentation... created for sharing of course!\n\nSpinach- with garlic, lemon and maybe a little cream or something? Lemon zest on top and this was all mine.\n\nCrispy Shrimp-with a very tasty chicharron sauce which is not made with pork rinds by the way!\n\n(The first time I was there I also had the Mac and Cheese, Piggy Back Dates, Chicken Skewers, Meatballs, Cuban Sliders, the Bread Pudding, Chocolate Kiss. Nothing disappointed me..and I mean NOTHING)\n\nUnfortunately the drinks aren't on the website and now I have to try to remember the names:\nWe had a Delicioso-with Rum and pineapple, I almost thought I tasted vanilla.

Most dishes hover right above $10, and the portions certainly do not match what you're paying for.  Last night was my third visit here, and each time I've been sure to stop by during happy hour.  Happy hour is from 5pm-7pm daily and gets you the following items at discount price (discount prices are listed below, and are approx. ~50% off full price, plus or minus $1):\n\nBeef Empanadas, $6.00 - It's alright.  Ground beef with some veggies inside pastry bread.  I'll eat it but it's not my first choice.  Comes with two empanadas, each cut in half.\nMac & Cheese, $4.00 - This is some tasty mac & cheese, using white cheese, cheddar cheese and some habanero.  The kick from the habanero makes this something that I would order every visit.  Portion is good for two, maybe three less-hungry people.\nCuban Sliders, $6.00 - These are delicious little burgers!  Made with ground pork, with a little ham thrown on top just because.  They've been juicy and full of flavor every time I've ordered these (which happens to be every time I've been here).  Order comes with three sliders, which are small to begin with.  Not worth full price.\nCrispy Shrimp, $6.00 - Yes, it is pieces of shrimp.  Yes, it was probably crunchy at some time with some sort of breading.  But no, it is not crispy when it arrives.  Last night was the first time I ordered it, and the sauce it comes with (panko?) made the shrimp soggy.  It had a citrus flavor and wasn't bad, but I can't see myself ordering it again.  Portion was decent enough for two to share.\nChicken Skewers, $? - The fifth and final food item on the happy hour menu.  The menu is small to begin with, and only five items are offered with happy hour pricing!  I *think* I had this during a previous visit but I'm not sure.  I didn't order it last night.\nSangria, $5.00 - I think there were a couple varieties offered during happy hour, each being $5.00.  It's not my favorite drink so I didn't order.\n\nDuring my visits it seems that on average people are paying roughly $15-$20 per person depending on who gets drinks.  When I go to Firefly with a group it's usually about $20 per person and the food is tastier, with more generous portions.

They have the unfortunate distinction of being in the exact same niche as the incomparable, untouchable \"El Pollo Supremo\" on University in Tempe, which means they are going to be directly compared to the godfathers of mesquite mexican cookery, and Sabroso is bound to end up in 2nd place.\n\nBut, that said, this place is good.  Quite good, as a matter of fact, and I would have no problem stopping in with my family for meals in the future, even though El Pollo Supremo is just a few miles farther.  I definitely think there is enough to distinguish Sabroso from its competitors to make it a unique experience.\n\nChicken portions are good sized and fairly apportioned (you don't get stuck with just a neck and a wing in a 2-piece meal), and very well cooked, but much more subject to gristly weirdness than Supremo.  The seasoning and style is somewhat different, too, and while I prefer Supremo's drier red-smoke flavor, I could certainly respect other's opinions that prefer the warm, moist and mild flavors of Sabroso.  Supremo is a dry but superb assault on the senses with smoke and sodium, Sabroso seems to aim for tender and moist succulence.  \n\nI think I dined here many years ago when it was under different ownership and the menu was all over the place, and the chicken back then was poor to fair.  Now, perhaps taking a hint from Supremo, Sabroso has signifcantly cut its menu down to the essentials (think whole chicken, 1/2 chicken, quarter chicken, and the essential sides and a couple quirky add ons) and that kind of laser-focus hopefully will keep them in business a long time as they perfect their chicken, and the Sabroso folks REALLY have improved the quality of the chicken compared to the last guys (Correatado?).  \n\nSabroso does have some tasty sides, and a good number of them, and their salsa is quite special, although not quite as good as Supremo's cold-pureed salsa.  I especially like the smoked jalapeno, and I wasn't sure what to make of it at first, but when I was done I considered it to be an integral and awesome component of the plate.  Good stuff!  The beans and rice are on par with the best of any authentic mexican eatery.\n\nI do think the folks at Sabroso are a bit more service oriented than at Supremo, so for the uninitiated, the overall dining experience may be better at Sabroso.  The guys at Sabroso actually seem to like to talk about their food and their concept, while the masters slaving over the red coals at Supremo seem WAYYYYY too busy and removed to deal with the little people.  Hey, artists at work, do not disturb!  The staff is friendly and informative at both places, but Supremo has more of a feel of a roach coach that just happens to be inside of a building, while Sabroso embraces the general restaurant and service concept better.  \n\nSo, in the ultimate final summary of the Sabroso / Supremo Smackdown:\n\nCHICKEN:  Supremo ***** Sabroso ***1/2\nSIDE QUALITY:  Supremo ****1/2 Sabroso ****\nSIDE CREATIVITY:  Supremo *** Sabroso ****\nSIDE PORTIONS:  Supremo *** Sabroso ****\nLOCATION:  Supremo *** Sabroso *1/2\nDESIGN/ATMOSPHERE:  Supremo ** Sabroso **1/2\nSERVICE:  Supremo *** Sabroso ****\n\nFINAL SCORE:  Its all about the chicken at these dives!  SUPREMO *****, SABROSO ****\n\nBut Sabroso is certainly highly recommended.  Skip your next night at Carlos O'Briens, Carolinas or Miguels and try something really special!

I gave up the opportunity to try the buffet, which is only at the #3 location, for the convenience of the shorter drive.\n\nThis location is at the end of a strip mall in a part of town where English is not necessarily spoken or understood.  I walk in to the well lit and brightly painted restaurant and am greeted by the waitress, bus person, cashier.  It goes like this;\n\nher:Hola\nMe: Hi\nher: Habla Espanol o Ingles?\nme: I don't speak Spanish\nher: (look of horror in her eyes as she realizes we will not communicate well) Are you taking out or eating here?

In El Salvador Horchata is made from Morro seed rather than rice which gives it a different flavor than the more common version found in Mexican places.  Let me assure you it is still a tasty drink.  I thought the chicken breast was a bit tough but it was quite tasty.  The meal comes with rice, beans and tortillas all of which are different than their Mexican counterparts.  The tortillas are the same biscuity type used to make Papusas and are really great at sopping up the juices from the onions and sauce.\n\nI left full and happy.  I never heard a word of English spoken in the building but it did not provide any barriers to ordering/eating.  We each understood just enough of each others language to communicate.  When I went to pay the bill there was a manager in the door way to the kitchen and it was my guess she was bi-lingual and could have translated.  There was a steady usage of about 4-5 tables the whole time.  \n\nWhile Salvadoran food is not real common in the states it certainly rates an additional choice to add to the list of ethnic restaurant options.

Boyfriend got the onion chicken, which had chicken breast sauteed with sweet or yellow onions and green peppers in sauce. Yum!

I'm adding the mine to the mix. \n\nI was looking for a place to eat yesterday, Sunday after Day 2 of the Rubber Stamp Show at the Convention Center a few blocks away and a lot of places were already closed for the day or by 5 o'clock. I found this one on Yelp and even though my tummy hadn't completely recovered from the stomach flu that I had a few days ago I decided to give them a shot. Gut instinct, pun intended. \n\nI sure wasn't sorry. Being South American food I was concerned about it being too spicy for my still somewhat delicate condition. I had nothing to fear. I mentioned to the girl at the counter that I didn't want anything spicy and she assured me the food wasn't. She asked if I would like some recommendations since I hadn't been there before and I agreed. The first thing she did was smile and point to the Bono bread in the little display case to my right and told me how good that was which was totally true.  It was a dollar for one roll and was almost sweet enough to qualify as a cookie, very fresh and delicious. It could have easily been eaten as a light dessert at the end. \n\nFTR, I'm one of those people that doesn't usually order drinks because it's hard to pay $2 for something I can buy for a quarter from the grocery, but when I saw they had the fruit smoothie type drinks, or fruit juices they called them, I decided to try one out. I believe they were $2.75.  I was going to get a fruit that I was familiar with like strawberry or Blackberry or guava but she recommended the Guanabana fruit drink and I decided to take her word for it.  She asked if I wanted it blended with water or milk and I thought milk would be healthier. It too was extremely fresh and delicious. I look forward to ordering a different flavor next time. \n\nThen she told me about the daily special, a chicken dish with two sides, and pointed to a lady in a booth that had one in front of her,  It looked absolutely delicious.  It was $10.95 which seemed a fair price for the quantity of food and what I suspected would be the quality, but I I was a little worried that it might be too spicy or tomato-y so I decided to order ala carte off the menu. \n\nI wanted to try the empanadas so I got a beef one.  It wasn't huge but it was delicious and homemade and seat well with my tummy and my taste buds. The last thing I ordered was what they called a corn cake with shredded chicken.  It wasn't at all what I envisioned. I was picturing a piece of cornbread like you would find in a southern-cooking place that had sort of a chicken gravy over the top. I wasn't too far off with the chicken part but the \"corn cake\" was more like a thick tortilla. That didn't matter because it too was mild and delicious, in fact so much so I was wishing there was some pepper to sprinkle over it. Instead I sprinkled a little bit of the mildly spicy green sauce that came with the empanada over it and that livened it up a little. \n\nEven though the portions didn't look large I got full before I finished and asked for a container to bring home about half of the corn cake with chicken which I ate later in the evening. I didn't have room for any of their delicious sounding desserts so I will have to go back to try more things including the dessert. In fact I'll have to go back several times I think to try various foods, drinks and desserts. I suspect they will all be as delicious as what I had. All I can say is a sure wish I'd found this place sooner although it is fun to find new places no matter how long I stay in an area. I think I may have seen this place listed before but assumed it was yet another Mexican place and I don't eat a lot of Mexican food since I can get that in San Diego . \n\nIn talking with the clerk she had asked me if I had ever had Colombian food. I told her about some of the various places I've been in the area that were Central and South American--Puerto Rican, Venezuelan, Salvadorian, Cuban, etc but she said that this place was the only Columbian place around. I told her I could definitely taste that it was unique from the other places. I forgot to ask her how long they have been open, if I might have overlooked them on previous trips or if they were recent .

I used to love the Peruvian place on Dobson/Warner next to C-Fu. They moved to Mesa, and then they closed down. I went to some other Peruvian place near by and for the first time I actually ate food from a restaurant that really want to make me gag. Ok going off tangent.... So here comes Contigo Peru. Fairly close to where I live and good reviews. The short version is, awful service on the part of OUR waitress and their food is mostly meh. 3 of us showed up at the restaurant and was seated promptly by a friendly staff. Ok so far so good.... Waited, and waited a bit before we get our menus. Waited, and waited a bit longer for the waitress to get our drink orders. BUT, she only took our drink orders and didn't ask if we wanted any starters. So we waited and waited some more and finally got our drinks and she asked if we want starters. We ordered the fried calamari. BUT, the waitress didn't ask if we are ready to order. So waited, and waited, and waited, finally I had to signal another waitress to get our waitress so we can orders in. We waited and waited and waited some more. I think about half an hour later, our calamari showed up. Oh yeah, looks like frozen calamari out of a bag. They where the little rings. No tentacles or anything. Heck, the calamari from Macaroni Grill was 10x better! Not only that, they were served with generic tartar sauce. The rings tasted like rubber bands. Chewy and tasteless. So we waited and waited some more and finally about another 30mins my gf's Pescado al Ajo came out. It's a battered a friend fish topped with butter and garlic. Smells good, looks good, but WTF are mine and my friend's dishes? Waited and waited and waited. Ok, do people not understand you serve all your dishes at a table at the same time? We are just joking about how Gordon Ramsey would be screaming and swearing back in the kitchen by now. So after a long wait, and after inquiring with the waitress, our dishes came out. I ordered the Lomo Saltado, and my friend ordered the  Tallarin Saltado de Carne, which essentially is just the same as my dish except with spaghetti instead of rice. My dish is a stirfry of fries (yes really fries you can get at the grocer's frozen section), onions, beef strips, and tomato in a soy sauce. This dish used to be my favorite. Well, all I can say is I have had much better and much flavorful than what I got. Just a note, it seems that Peruvian stir fry, they don't fully cook the veggies. Of all the places I have had this dish, the veggies are always half cooked. Just so people don't get surprised. Anyhow, their only saving grace was the fish. It was tender, flaky, and pretty good. Unfortunately, the breading for the fish was a soggy mush mess. But the fish itself was quite good. So this ENTIRE time, that waitress has not came by ONCE to check and see how we are doing. Thankfully the owner/manager (?) did once. From what we have observed, it seems that we just happen to got the worst waitress ever. Because the other waitress was attentive and people got their food fast. Heck, even people arrived after us and ordered after us got their food WAY before us with that better waitress. We suspect this particular waitress has no clue how to wait on tables and most likely messed up our order tickets or something.

The ceviche pescado was 1/3 the size and couple dollars more than Rincon Peruana's. It had good flavor, but it was very small in comparison. Considering that it is a simple cold cooked tilapia, I don't understand the need to be skimpy. We also got a whole pollo a la brasa which is supposed to be a seasoned rotisserie chicken. It looked right and the flavor was about right but it lacked that super tender fall off the bone quality that is the other hallmark of this dish. Texture was like that of baked chicken. It wasn't horrible. It just wasn't what it was supposed to be. Also, Contigo Peru is tight with their sauces and cancha cerrano. Cancha cerrano is like a toasted corn nut. Usually it is served in place of bread and butter. Our togo order did not include any and she would have charged us for some if we had not complained about the size of the ceviche. They were reluctant about giving usadditional aji verde and the pollo a la brasa sauce they provided for our whole order looked like the same amount needed for a single 1/4 size order, but we did not realize this until we got home.

I'm definitely a fan but I don't have enough experience with Peruvian cuisine to know if it's as good as it gets. : )\n\nI was first introduced to Peruvian food a week ago and have now been to Contigo Peru 3 times. From what I have come to learn, it is a natural fusion cuisine. There are large populations of different ethnic groups (some major ones being Chinese, Japanese and Italian) in Peru and those influences have all spilled over into the food of Peru. From what I understand, the cuisine of Peru is quite varied and the food served at Contigo Peru is primarily that of Lima.\n\nThe restaurant itself is great. It's clean and casual and the staff is amazingly nice. They were super helpful on every visit. I can't say enough about them. \n\nOver the course of our visits, we had:\n\nLomo Saltado - tender loin beef strips stir fried with onions, tomatoes & french fries served with rice. \n\nI understand this is a classic dish. I completely loved it. The stir fry is Chinese influence with tastes of soy sauce. It seemed like total comfort food, even bringing back memories of \"chips & gravy\" for the Oz folk and maybe even brings poutine to mind? It's kind of a carb fest but it's great. Easily accessible and super tasty. Not spicy at all. The kids loved it too. If you're new to Peruvian food, definitely a good place to start.\n\nSaltado Contigo Peru - basically the same as loom saltado with shrimp. Also great.\n\nYuca con frita huancaina - slices of deep fried yucca root with a cheese and aji sauce.\n\nFirst of all, aji here refers to peppers. This term is used all over the place. We enjoyed this but I don't know that we get the huancaina sauce yet. We ended up eating the yucca with aji (in this case referring to the spicy sauces/salsas on the table - more on that later). \n\nCeviche de pescado / camarones - ceviche with fish and/or shrimp,  shaved onion, lettuce, yam, corn on the cob & dried corn kernels (called ganchas?). \n\nI loved these dishes. Sour and tasty but the thing that stood out most to me was the amazing contrast of textures. \n\nCausa - layers of mashed potatoes seasoned with lime juice & aji and a chicken salad layer in between.\n\nKind of a crazy dish. Surprising texture (soft all the way through) but I really liked it. I liked the hint of spice and the taste of lime with the potatoes.\n\nChaufa Contigo Peru - beef, chicken and shrimp fried rice.\n\nEnjoyed this well though I didn't really see a great deviation from typical Chinese fried rice.\n\nPescado a lo Macho - fish fillet fried and covered with a spicy seafood sauce containing shrimp, scallops, calamari, mussels. Also some fried yucca slices.\n\nThis is a great dish. Super tasty with a bit of spice. One of the Heather's favorites.\n\nAji de Gallina - creamy yellow, spicy sauce, made with shredded chicken, aj\u00ed amarillo (yellow chilis), cheese, milk, bread, and walnuts served with rice.\n\nThis was another great dish. It's actually not on the menu but I think they have it most Friday, Saturday, Sundays. Heather called it pure comfort food. Loved it, especially the subtle hint of spice. Think this will be a staple order. \n\nAnticuchos - skewers of beef heart marinated in Peruvian spices and grilled. Also comes with it's own spiciy sauce.\n\nThis is another special dish. It's not on the menu and only there on occasion. Since they had it, I had to try it and definitely enjoyed it. Not spicy without the sauce. The kids also liked it quite well.\n\nRotisserie chicken - killer rotisserie chicken.\n\nI loved this especially with the aji (spicy sauces) on the table. There were two of these, red & green, with the red being a bit spicier and the green having more of a cilantro flavor. I became a huge fan of these immediately. The first visit, I was using pieces of bread as a vehicle for the sauce. For the 2nd & 3rd visits, we ordered the chicken which just went perfectly with the aji. We also used it quite liberally in many other ways (on the yucca, over the chaufa, etc.).\n\nIf there were a good Peruvian restaurant close to the house, the rotisserie chicken and aji would be a definite staple. Felt healthyish and so tasty.\n\nChica Morada - Peruvian purple corn drink made with pineapple rind, cinnamon, and clove and then mixed with sugar and lemon.\n\nI had this every visit and will probably always do. I actually liked a bit diluted. Light and clean. You can also order it by the pitcher which seems the best deal if you have at least a couple people drinking it.\n\nAll in all, I'd say we didn't have a bad dish. Looking at the menu, it can seem like french fry overload but with a bit of consideration, it definitely doesn't have to be that.\n\nI'm a big fan and will be back often.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 8, "useful": 11, "cool": 7}}, {"text": "This review gets a 5 star just on the chef himself. \n\nAs I walk in, the lady that I believe owns the restaurant seats me, but is a little busy with some other tables..

We went around 8:15pm on a Friday night and were greeted and waited on right away by a man and a woman who I believe were the owners.  I told them we'd never been there before and had never tried Peruvian food.  They were so helpful and friendly.  First off they gave us a sample of the PURPLE CORN DRINK and although it was very strange and unfamiliar to us, it was very good.  You'd never guess it was made of corn.  I loved it.  \n\nThen we were ready to order our meals.  My boyfriend loves fish (me, not so much) but he steers away from fried foods.  The owner suggested he have the Pescado Sudado which is steamed fish fillet with onions, tomatoes and cilantro served with rice.  The owner said it's like a soup.  This dish was served first.  (And I'll say now that the only somewhat negative thing I can say about this place is that they will bring the dishes out as they're cooked. For us this meant my boyfriend's food was served to him quite a while before my food came.)  My boyfriend began eating his food and was loving it.  He kept insisting that I try it, but I'm not a fish lover.  I finally tried it and was amazed that it was even fish.  No fishy taste...it was delicious!  It had a delicious flavor that I've never tasted before and later I found out it was from the YUCCA ROOT that we thought were potatoes. So good. \n\nI ordered the Saltado Contigo Peru which is beef tenderloin strips, shrimp, tomatoes, onions and french fries all stir fried together. Sounds a bit odd, but it was very yummy.  Also served with white rice.  I also ordered Chaufa de Pollo which is Peruvian chicken fried rice.  The Chinese influence is very evident here.  Had a ginger flavor and was delicious.  \n\nIn summary....I loved the owners--very friendly and helpful.  I loved the casual, clean atmosphere.  The food---incredible!!

You will, otherwise, miss little delights like Contigo.\n\nWe were greeted upon entering the door as if we were family.

This national drink of Peru uses Peruvian Pisco as the base liquor, and the addition of lime (or lemon) juice, syrup, ice, egg white, and Angostura bitters.  Delicious.\n\nAll of our usual favorite dishes were present and accounted for on the menu, and since we were with our own friends and family, we passed plates and tasted everything.  We whet our appetites with a nice variety of fresh ceviches, which perfectly led us to delicious main courses, including Saltados (lomo, pollo and mariscos); Tallarin, Chaufas, and Suprema de Pollo.  All exceptionally prepared.  All extremely reasonably priced.\n\nSo make your way to this nondescript corner of this nondescript strip center in suburban Chandler and enjoy this exceptional gem of a restaurant.

Considering the fact they had just opened the week prior, this wasn't necessarily a must. We were seated right away and promptly greeted by our friendly server. There were a few other tables of families scattered throughout the fully remodeled Mexican grill but it wasn't crazy busy. It's hard to imagine this being Joey's of Chicago or Rhumbi just a few short months ago.\n\nBeing a sucker for a good salsa (I really do feel like that can make or break a Mexican restaurant), we decided to start out with the salsa trio and the fresh, traditional guacamole. The guacamole was amazing and the salsas were nice with a unique touch! Now I tend to like everything really spicy and I didn't find any of the salsas to have too much of a \"kick\" to them, but they were delicious none-the-less.\n\nAfter perusing the drink menu for some time, I finally decided on the Sandia Diablo (jalape\u00f1o-infused Tito's vodka, watermelon pur\u00e9e, cranberry, and pressed lime). This was outstanding! Seeing as how I am quite the vodka-cran aficionado, this sounded like a perfect, Mexican-infused twist on my favorite classic.\n\nFor dinner we all opted for different dishes so we could try a variety of menu items. I'm always a taco person so I went with the carne tacos (3 to an order). These were pretty darn good...nicely seasoned with refreshing toppings that complimented the meat well. Now most menu options seemed to be served a la carte, so we ordered a variety of sides to try. Our table had two orders of the basmati rice which I must say was definitely different. It had a very balsamic taste to it (which I didn't mind because I love vinegar), however, it is not your traditional rice. We also tried the frijoles blancos and frijoles rancheros which were both delicious!\n\nNow this isn't going to be your traditional Mexican restaurant.

Glad I have a DD :-) - that was my tip for Milagro Grill.  Yes, I'm a Pacifico fan, and yes, having it on tap is so much better than bottled.  The wife and daughter and I came in for dinner early on a Friday evening.  We were hoping to get on the patio, as the weather is perfect for that this time of year.  Unfortunately, there was a raucous bachelor party that had reserved the entire patio, so we chose a booth in the bar.\n\nMilagro Grill fills out a spot in a small shopping center just west of 44th street on Indian School road.  This space has hosted other franchise operations that came and went, it just didn't seem like a good location.  I always wondered why they did not extend a patio out toward the road, and I guess the owners of Milagro Grill thought the same - and did it.  Inside it has been totally redesigned, and has a dark, classy feel in the intimate dining room.  The bar sits between two open garage doors that lead out to a nice patio deck.  The feel is upscale and doesn't shout Mexican at all.  The food is as classy and tasty as the decor, having a more central Mexican/fusion vibe to it.\n\nScoffing at the tradional complimentary bowl of chips and salsa, Milagro charges $4 for a decent-sized bowl of fresh and warm chips, with a small boat of mild salsa to go with it.  As I finished my Pacifico, the waittress came by to see if I wanted a refill - on tap as well as Pacifico, they had a kiltlifter, and a Vermont IPA called Magic Hat, the acoustics here aren't the greatest and with the noisy crowd in the background, I couldn't tell if she was saying Magic Cat, Mat, Fat, Pat or Rat, but no, it was Hat.  And it was good.  Moving on, we ordered our entrees, I had Costilla Tacos, the wife had Pescado ala Parilla and the daughter, of course, had Pollo tacos.\n\nService was unobtrusive and professional and our dinner arrived quickly.  My three Costilla tacos were a nice blend of shredded short-ribs, mixed with cabbage and peanuts, red pepper and pasilla chile with a hint of dried cherries.  It was quite an interesting take on a taco - where you expect bold, hot flavors, this was more of almost a fruity-sweet flavor.  It was not bad at all, and quite different.  The wife was too busy eating her tacos made with Grilled mahi-mahi, serrano, Avocado and cabbage,  but she did comment that it was delicous as well.

The bill came out just over $50 which was not bad for dinner and drinks for three, but prolly a little more than I would want to spend for a typical casual dinner.

First let me say I am a fan. Very tasty and unique flavored street tacos. I ordered the al pastor with the pineapple and the flavors were wonderful. Loved the taste of the tortillas. Yes, they are more of the smaller street taco size but not anywhere near the \"not much bigger then a 50 cent coin\"  post I saw earlier.  As a person being conscious of calorie counting right now I loved that ithis restaurant only uses one tortilla per taco as opposed to some other places that put two tortillas per taco just to make them more filling, and that Milagro concentrated more on the flavor.  I also ordered the rancho beans which were very tasty and served in a small side pot.  Very friendly service from the waiter and a comfortable atmosphere even for one person dining alone. I do plan on returning, as my waiter suggested, for the Saturday brunch they have coming up for cervezas on the patio and some football watching.  The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 star is just the price point.  $15 for 3 tacos and a side of beans is a bit more on the pricey side for a lunch meal. I think they will figure that out with all the feedback and of course the build out on the place could not have been cheap.  When that happens my star will surely become a 5.

Otherwise it's sort of hard to find. The address is 4280 E. Indian School.  It's right across the street from another of my favorite spots, La Fontanella's if that helps!\n\n First thing in the door, we were greeted enthusiastically by the Host.  She welcomed us and seated us with a terrific attitude.  Then Katie, our server greeted us and took our drink order.  Water was brought out right away.  We decided on Iced Tea, as opposed to an alcoholic beverage.  It was eleven in the morning and I don't want to appear to be a total lush!  The Iced Tea was nice and strong, the way I like it.  Black tea and plenty of it!\n\nThe manager Jared Johnson came over and introduced himself. We discussed my gluten free status and he said he was trying to learn very quickly about gluten free eating.  He said that the kitchen was very good about knowing how to prepare gluten free foods and he was trying to make sure they do things right.  Everything is made fresh onsite, which should help with that!  They seem very concerned about making their customer's dietary needs a priority.\n\n While we were talking, my husband commented that I loved guacamole and he'd read that their guac was amazing so Jared sent their homemade guacamole out, which is made fresh, with home made chips and their salsa de la casa, made with cascabel chili.This House Salsa was so smokey and flavorful without having a \"traditional\" salsa taste.  It was kind of a nutty flavor which just has to be tried!\n  \nLooking over the Brunch menu did have it's drawbacks.  The names and descriptions were sort of baffling.  Something they MIGHT want to think about changing.....but Katie was great about explaining each one!  I had the Enfrijoladas, which was basically chicken enchiladas with a white bean and tomatillo sauce....topped with an egg (I opted for scrambled).  I was blown away by the smokey taste of the chicken.  It also had some cheese but what I loved was the bean and tomatillo puree.  There was definitely a smooth hotness factor but it was so subtle and appealing that I really enjoyed it.\n\nMy husband opted for the Chorizo Con Huevos which was a flatbread with a very mild Chorizo, some charred tomato, potato and cheese with an egg on top.  He really enjoyed it and thought that the flavors went very well together.  He said the only thing he'd change is maybe have the egg on the side.  But who doesn't love pizza for breakfast?\n\n We were really blown away with the quality of the food as well as the super efficient staff.  They have a smokin' hot terrific happy hour as well, which we are going back for specifically!  I want to try a Milagro Margarita!\n\n  The gorgeous Retro '70's feel to the decor and the large, easy to sit in chairs impressed me!\n\nOh, did I happen to mention they are the 2012 AZ Taco Festival Grand Champion's?

Mini-flying saucers, and they were invading our dinner table - for what?  To declare it sovereign?  Suddenly, a gush of hot liquid poured from the sky, filling the giant discs partially with an aromatic, steamy pool of stock.  \n\nPHEW!  not an invasion, just Caldo De Pollo served in giant-sized bowls.  I mean the lips on these things were about four inches wide!  You practically had to take the stairs to get to the soup.  Resting next to those fries that had been tossed with a crumbly cotijo cheese, was a delicious, juicy Hamburguesa, served on a toasted Bolillo bun, with Crispy Bacon, Jalepeno, Red Onion and Tomato shoved in there with it.  A slice of melty Manchego cheese and a dollop of \"Milagro Sauce\"  finished it off.\n\nWe started the meal with a traditional chips and salsa, augmented with a cup of fresh guacamole.  The chips were salty and hot and dipped in the chunky guacamole were delicious.  For drinks, the wife and I had draft, Modelo Especial, served in large, fluted beer glasses.  I had to follow that up with a Magic Hat #9, which is a tangy and tasty microbrew from Vermont.\n\nAs always, I ordered my burger  (Pronounced HomBer - Gaysa) according to my college-educated daughter.  I guess those years of conversational Spanish helped :-), anyway, medrare.  The burger came out overcooked, but only medium, so it was not bad at all.  I asked for a dish of the Milagro sauce on the side to dip the fries in, and it's yer basic Chipotle Mayo, but delicious as well.\n\nThe ladies had difficulty finishing their soup and a shared flatbread - Chicken Caesar flatbread, which they both agreed was very good, but the soup was also more filling than they expected.  My Gold-Canyon burger was also very tasty and with the giant mound of fries, I could not eat it all either.\n\nWe dined on the patio as we love patio dining, and the hostess first seated us at a tall table with stools, which was uncomfortable and the table rocked violently if you even breathed hard.  Our waiter generously offered to move us to a table on the other side of the patio, which worked out perfectly.  This waiter was very outgoing and personable, unlike his partner who seemed a bit snooty.  Not a big deal, but it kinda makes you feel a bit unwelcome to be treated with a waiter talking down his nose at you, however, in his defense, he did warm up by the end of the meal.\n\nEverybody in the restaurant seemed to be waiting on tables in one way or another, even the bartender came out and made sure our beers were full, and it appeared that the manager was just as involved in customer service.

However a reservation at this small place really just means a bump up in line. Do not go expecting to sit and eat right away. Its a small place.. and is popular enough to keep it busy with at least one or two groups waiting outside during the weekend dinner rush.\n\nThis place is run by a husband/wife team and I can only assume the younger gentlemen was also part of the family. Can you beat food prepared by someones mom/grandma? Maybe if yours is from the region your menu is from. Otherwise I highly doubt it.\n\nThe Food:\n\nBandeja Paisa:\nThis is what I came for. After watching Anthony Bourdain chow down on this in the Columbian episode I HAD.. HAD.. HAD to have this. Chorizo, chicharones con carne, fried eggs, fried plantains, plantain patacones, arepa, beans, avocado, carne asada and rice. The only way this could have been better would be to have more of it! How do you make bacon better? You leave the pork back on it and deep fry it. Even with my cold everything tasted amazing.\n\nEmpanadas:\nWe had three types chicken, beef, pork.\nChicken: Was in more of a flaky, buttery, pastry type shell. I would say this was more of a pot pie in a portable package.\nBeef/Pork: Both of these were more traditional. My taste buds were a bit off so I had a hard time telling which was which. One of them was slightly sweet and FREAKING AMAZING. I could have sat and ate a dozen of those. I believe it was the pork one that was sweet.\n\nSeafood Soup(Sorry don't remember the name):\nI'm not a fan of things with fins unless they are in a fish tank ;) My friend has this soup. I was a little worried because it smelled VERY VERY fishy and supposedly the only seafood in it was shrimp. To me when a shrimp has a very strong fish smell that's bad news. I have a feeling it was a fish based stock and that's where the aroma came from. Either way he really liked it.\n\nFillet with Fried Potatoes(Again didn't catch the name of this. Sorry for the major fail):\nThis was a grilled fillet sliced in a dark sauce with \"fried potatoes\" which in this case were french fry's. Looked a little odd to me but my friend loved it.\n\nEcuadorian Tamale:\nSo after reading the other reviews I decided to skip on the red and green as they seemed to be standard Mexican tamales. Could I be missing out? Maybe but I was there for home field advantage cooking. So I got the Ecuadorian tamale. This was cooked in a banana leaf. I was having a hard time getting the banana leaf flavor but the rest of my party assured me it was there. Again.. stuffy nose :(\n\nFlan de Coco:\nWow.. two of my favorite things in one, coconut and flan. This was pretty good. I can't say it was earth shattering but the coconut was not overly sweet. The \"syrup\" had a nice deep caramelized flavor. The flan had a nice texture. I have had better but it was nothing to complain about.\n\nPlantain Torte:\nThis was not what I expect and in a good way! They had mushed up the plantains into more of a pumpkin pie like texture. I believe it was also mixed with either a blueberry or blackberry as the color was slightly blue and it had a hint of one of those two berries. This was my favorite out the the two. It was the perfect sweet. The texture was very nice. It didn't give me that instant insulin shock affect from a sugar laden dessert.\n\nI will be back! Sadly I'm not sure when because I have many many other places to try but I'll get back there sometime. There were still a decent amount of things on the menu I would have liked to try out.\n\nPros:\nSuper tasty food prepared by someones equivalent of your grandma.\nVery friendly service.. Think dinner at a aunt/uncles house.\nWide variety from many Latin American areas.\n\nCons:\nOnly thing I can come up with really is the wait. This is more of a personal thing. I really don't like to wait for a seat somewhere. I believe you should be able to make a reservation and be seated within 5 minutes of arrival.

The pork on Ravi's plate was lukewarm and dry, as was the \"steak\" (which appeared to simply be a thin slice of top round) on Elaine's plate.

Definitely worth a try.\nThere was a shrimp dish that was kind of like a gumbo. I wish I remembered what it was called. Did not disappoint.\nLastly, we had some sort of fish dish in a banana leaf. I didn't really like the flavoring of the fish.

The empanada was a bit different than what I am used to in Mexico since it was fried but it was really yummy. The outside tasted like masa rather than wheat flour based dough. And the filling was good, too. My only regret is that there wasn't more of it. Next time I would order two! ;0) The tamal was absolutely delicious and I would say a must get. The masa was wonderful, not too greasy but not too fluffy. And just a hint of sweetness so you can tell its green corn. There was a mild chili and some creamy white cheese in the center. So simple and yet so good!!\n\nFor our entr\u00e9es, I had the Sango de Camarones. Unfortunately I didn't care for this one too much. I don't think there was anything wrong with it, just not to my taste. I was expecting a brothy soup with the shrimp but really it was more of a gumbo type dish. I still ate the shrimp and I will say that they know how to cook shrimp. In both my dish and the bit of ceviche I tasted the shrimp was not rubbery and overcooked at all, it was perfectly pink and juicy. Edgar had carne asada which he asked for spicy. But little did he know how spicy it would be! I almost think they have ghost peppers back there. That is what the dish tasted like and the sauce was red. The meat was very tender and flavorful (yes, I stole a bite) the side dishes were good as well (lentils and plantain fritters). For dessert we split a coco flan which unfortunately we ordered just by pointing at what someone else had got rather than looking at the menu and seeing that it contained coconut. Hubby doesn't particularly like coconut but since this dish is sort of half cake and half flan, the flan part didn't have much coconut in it.

In fact you really have to be looking for it when you drive into the shopping center.  Its tiny and tucked away so you wouldn't even notice it from the street.  Inside its just basically 5 or 6 small tables with seating for no more than 15-20 people.  There are emblems on the wall from Ecuador and other parts of Latin America, but otherwise its pretty plain.  We were greeted by a very sweet older lady (pretty sure she was the owner) and waited on by an elderly gentleman (the owner's husband?).  The service we received throughout was extremely friendly and polite, but pretty slow (which Yelpers correctly warned me about).  Fortunately we weren't in a hurry.\n\nThe menu's emphasis is primarily on Ecuadorian dishes, but it basically covers the wide spectrum of Latin American cuisine.  My friends both went for the tamale combo which includes three tamales each.  It includes a red tamale with red chile sauce and shredded pork, a green tamale with green chiles and cheese, and an Ecuadorian tamale with pork, aji chile and vegetables in a banana leaf.  One of them also got a pork empanada.  I went with arguably their most popular entr\u00e9e, the Bandeja Paisa.  Basically reads like a greatest hits menu and includes rice, beans, carne asada, a fried egg, chicharron, chorizo, maduros, arepa, and avocado.  All of us agreed the food was incredible and very much tasted homemade.  And surprisingly none of us felt overwhelmingly full.  And the best part of it all was the prices.  All that great food set us back a mere $12 each (including tip).  Hard to beat that.  We didn't get any drinks or dessert this time, but we all plan to give that a go next time.\n\nWith chains ruling the roost out in the West Valley its great to find a truly unique Mom and Pop restaurant offering delicious hard to find food at great prices.

Both times, we also had super-friendly servers who were very attentive. \n\nWe did not fall head-over-heels for the margaritas, though. We tried the $5 Padre's Margarita and found it to be way too sweet. Not the worst margarita we've had, but nothing outstanding either; I much prefer the house margaritas at Z Tejas if I'm going to go cheap, or the fresh-squeezed/hand-mixed ones at McCormick's if I feel like splurging. \n\nWe also weren't huge fans of the dining area. The first time, we chose to sat there, whereas the second time we were offered a table since the bar area was full.

The use of glass and wood are truly lovely.* \n\nThat said, Padre's appeals to the lowest common denominator of the hip hop crowd that patronize this restaurant on Sunday afternoons. With a $5 cover, one would think there would be more of a draw than good music and a periodically tight crowd. Unfortunately, the music is where it begins and ends with Padre's. \n\nSome years ago we ate at Padre's and found the food to be quite good. I don't know what happened in the interim. For a restaurant that is first and foremost a place to get food, and also serves alcohol, to be serving their foodstuff on paper plates is disastrous. Yeah, I understand that you'll be saving a lot of water not having to wash all those plates, but that's something I expected at a bar that serves food as an afterthought--not the other way around. And if a restaurant has a waitstaff, one can reasonably expect an amicable staff with at least an iota of attentiveness towards their clientele. Nope, not here. I do understand that the younger crowd wasn't raised to appreciate waitstaff and probably don't tip, so I kind of understand why you'd rather try to get in some girl's pants than take three consecutive orders. Perhaps you, dear server, are better suited to working in an environment that doesn't require such distractions as doing one's job. And one might mistakenly presume that a restaurant would put its reputation on the line with the food that is served. Not the case at Padre's, whose view of \"modern\" is fast at the expense of flavor. Don't serve me rancid cheese on a stale tortilla and expect me to not be ticked off.

Whatever.  \n\nSo when we were seated we had a problem with the waiter right away. We were his only table and right when we were seated he came up to us, this is cool, then he asked for our drink order I had just picked up the drink menu and before I could look at it he wanted my order I asked for a frozen mararita and that is a no go, so then I say let me look at the drink list and he tells me he will be back he is going to get my dates drink and take my order when he brings hers. Um, FU Man, well i thought this was rude. He could have made a seggestion or even took a min he had no other tables. Whatever i delt with it. Then he comes back I give him my drink order and he askes if we wanted an app. We asked him to give us a min and come back and he says ok well how about some chips and guac to munch on while you look at the menu. Sure we say and as he walks away Iook at the menu and the chips are $9. Chips and guac, for $9 I could get three mini tostadas with chicken. Ah I will pass on the $9 chips. This guy was not helpful with the menu and I hate it when you ask what is good or what is your favorite or mabey the most ordered dish and all they say is everything is good not sure what the best is. This guy blows and he should not be a server, at all. Not friendly and just a frekin douce bag! He did not care about nothing this guy.

Peppers and onions were delicious and they have the best rice and beans.  The flower tortillas were heated on the flat top and crisped up and chared a little, yum. The Pollo Relleno is the house signature dish! chicken breast stuffed with poblano chiles, caramelized onion, corn and goat cheese finished with poblano cream sauce. paired with guajillo mashed potatoes, and vegetables. I will be back for this for sure. Its so good. The mash were a little dry but good flavor. The chicken was moist and had tons of flavor. I was hoping it was going to be a little bit spicy but it really did not matter cause the flavor was there. So many good things on the menu and I will be back for sure. I absolutly will refuse having that server again. This place is great, awsome little patio and the inside is nice to. No booths but nice and clean look inside with art hanging next to every table. My opinion its way better than Barrio, cause there the only thing I liked was the pork, and I tried 4 different dishes there, plus I felt like I was eating in a alley or something. So for now I will give this place 3 stars, -1 cause of the service, but I will be back to do a follow up. On the way out the owner stopped me and asked me how everything was. He stood outside and talked to me for about five min. I told him I loved the food and will be bringing the folks back to try.

Both entrees were excellent.  I was especially surprised by the enchiladas....you don't usually see salmon and spinach in an enchilada...and executed very well.   We got the guacamole and lobster quesadilla for an app.  The quesadilla was \"ok\", but the guacamole was very good.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice and cozy.  The bar and patio areas are where you will want to site...they have a more authentic feel and the vibe is great.  The dinning room is so-so.\n\nThe service was superior and our waiter was way cool and made great recommendations.  He was attentive and knowledgable about the food.

Being relatively new to the area and otherwise afraid to attempt to turn left onto 7th St, I summed up the courage one day after having been invited to lunch by a friend and made the mad dash across the street and down to Ticoz Resto-Bar. In the amount of time it took me to turn left I probably could have just walked there, but that's neither here nor there. \n\nUpon entering, I feel like I have been transported to some urban-cool hipster hangout that actually wasn't situated right next to a brake repair shop. Replete with so-dark-you-can't-see candle lighting and 11 minute remixes of the latest breakout dance track, you have your choice of seating situations. You can dine in the dining room, belly up to the bar for cocktails or brave the outdoors on the patio. \n\nMy lunch companion and I were seated on the patio immediately. I found it odd that there were signs posted to remind patrons to keep the volume of their conversations at a \"normal\" level as not to disturb nearby residents. Suddenly, I'm reliving a moment from kindergarten and being reminded to use my indoor voice. Since I'm now in my 30's and I've finally gotten the hang of that trick, I take a chance and converse with my lunch companion using my normal everyday voice. This is something you may want to bear in mind if you are meeting up with a large group of people after dark, want to sit on the patio and some members of your party are incapable of controlling their screaming and/or giggling.\n\nThe menu offers enough variety to not only set it apart from other run-of-the-mill Southwestern restaurants but also makes me want to come back and try the other items at a later date. I opt for the Pork Torta Sandwich this time around, accompanied by a glass of Passion Fruit Sangria. The Pork Torta is served on grilled flat bread and is very flavorful. It's served with a side of what I can only call cole slaw.  The dressing is very tangy and flavorful and a nice compliment to the entree. The Sangria was potent and also went well with the meal, but seemed a little pricey. My dining companion has ordered the Coconut Curry Rice with beef and after sneaking a bite off of his plate when I alerted him to \"something shiny\" in the corner, I find it too is very delicious and flavorful, combining a number of unique flavors to create an altogether different dish than I have experienced at any other restaurant that might serve a patron a taco. \n\nA good attribute about Ticoz is the fact that it's open until midnight. This makes it one of the few places in Phoenix that doesn't lock up come nightfall (laundromats aside). I work late hours every day and I like the fact that I can still meet up with friends after a long day and sip cocktails without worry of being forced to cram waffle fries down my throat at an unsafe speed before being given the heave-ho, or worse yet, having to go to Applebees.

Why?  It was based on these reviews that I decided to try the place.\n\nI was totally prepared to wait when we arrived because we got there at about 7:15 on a Friday night.  They said 30 min wait for a party of 5. Not too bad.  After watching 3 groups who came in after us be seated first (and yes, one was a party of 5) we approached the hostess stand to check on things.  Suddenly we were \"next\".\n\nServer was Justin.  He said his hellos, told us about the specials, took our drink orders. We'd planned to try a few appetizers, but at that point we were all hungry enough we wanted to go right for the main course. Then we were brought the chips and salsa.  I inquired about the 3 salsas.  He said, this one is hot, this one is pico de gallo, and this is our pineapple salsa.  The chips weren't just \"got out of a bag\" chips, they were no-name, not very good, wouldn't serve them to my friends chips.  But, we nibbled on them anyhow because we wanted to try the salsas.  I went right for the hot.  Hot?  It was barely warm.  It was very \"tomato\" tasting, with one person commenting that it almost had spagetti sauce taste.  How can you be going for a Latin flavor and not be packing any heat??  I try the \"Pico de gallo\".  It's chunky salsa.  But whatever.  It had that fresh taste that many salsas have fresh out of the bottle.  My last hopes were the pineapple salsa.  It was different, and in the end the one I actually liked the most because at least they were trying to be creative.\n\nCan you believe I'm not to the main courses yet?  Justin sets them down quickly and makes his escape.  Visually - they were quite good.  2 of our folks got tortas - one beef and one chicken.  They were \"fine\".  Both tortas and the burgers come with fries and the fruit slaw on the side. No one liked the slaw.(Friend said it was more straw than slaw)  To me, it was ok - but not worthy of the large portion it took on the plate.  Would have been MUCH better to just fill the plate with the waffle fries that were actually pretty good.  One person got shrimp enchiladas.  That was pretty good - but could have been done just as well or better by quite a few places in town.  I got the pork loin chops.  Honestly - with this being one at their highest price point, I figured I should really get to see their strength here.  It was pretty.  The two thin chops were cooked fine - but it wasn't cooked IN anything for extra flavor, which pork really needs.  It touted an \"herby garlic, cilantro, lime sauce\".  It was green, and not bad, but with those things you would have thought it might have had more kick.  Or at least flavor. It wasn't bad in a way that detracted from the meal, but it didn't add much.  The green beans were at that same \"fine\" point.  They were very green and looked great.  But beyond the almonds someone threw on top (again, not cooked with at all, just threw on top at the last minute) there wasn't much flavor.  ( I buy the big frozen bag from Trader Joe's, steam them, toss w/ a pat of butter, salt and pepper and they could kick the butt of these green beans. I didn't have that high of a bar, but they didn't even meet it.)\n\nThe night was capped with some poor service mistakes.  Several of us had discussed trying a desert.  Instead of a request for desert, we got a check.  We figured it was a sign.  We were dividing the check into 2.  A friend who had been a server suggested that we mark the items that went on a particular card and then it was easiest for them to split the check.  We were explaining that to Justin as he was seemingly running from the table. (Did we have ebola and no one told us?)  When he accidentally put the wrong total on each card, and we asked him to switch the totals, rather than go do it, he was argumentative at the table for several minutes about how he did it right and kept trying to push fault to the friend who handed him the bill. he then stormed from the table (like a 2 yr old) saying as he went, \"Fine, I'll just have to go switch them\".  Yea, that's all we'd been going for.  The whole table felt uncomfortable and insulted.  A friend noticed we were \"dropped off\" to go boxes when all other tables had their food taken away and the server put them in the boxes.  I don't know if we just had an awful server or if he thought we'd be bad tippers (I've never gone under 20% for good service - bad never gets less then 15%) but it will be a long time before any of us go there again.

Its melange of Latin inspired dishes, lovingly prepared by Chef Holly Gibson, offer a variety of flavors from Puerto Penasco (Ticoz Street Tacos) to the Caribbean (Coconut GInger Curry Rice).\n\nI had the opportunity to speak with Chef Holly when coming here for a \"YAP.\" (Yelper Appreciation Party)  Invitees were lured by drink tickets and a specially prepared spread.  Ticoz' reputation had previously awakened my culinary curiosity, so this was my first experience of the restaurant and its food.\n\nAhhh, the sight before me when I walked into the restaurant brought back visions of nights in Puerto Vallarta; ordering tacos and tostadas from street vendors at 2 in the morning.  Or was it the talk I had with Chef Holly, when she talked of her inspiration for one of Ticoz Signatures?  Though she grew up in Arizona (so rare, i know!) she spent much time in Mexico, vacationing with family.  It is here where she discovered the \"street taco\" and brought it back to Phoenix. \n\nI was to enjoy four of these ambrosial tacos the night of the event.  House braised meats on soft corn tortillas, festooned with cabbage, and blanketed with chipotle and an avocado crema.  To give the right amount of tribute, I want to describe Chef Holly's simple secrets to the taco meats.  The chicken is braised  in pineapple and chipotle, the beef in lime and cilantro, and the pork in orange and clove.  These make for distinct flavor combinations, and the juiciest and most tender meat.   The tacos caused a great well being, as everyone was magically transported to the Mayan riviera, with a cold margarita in hand.\n\nI have to digress here, because i just typed one of my favorite words.  Margarita.  I easily enjoyed four of them, to go with the four tacos.  I could not help myself, they were pure titillation.  Not to mention, all the exotic libations are1/2 off between the hours of 4:00p-6:30p.   An unbeatable value, considering the average tropical cocktail here costs only $7.   In addition, the owners were extremely generous in offering its \"Yelping\" patrons two free drink tickets - even for 16oz. of jubilation.  \n\nThe drinks deserve a list all on their own:\n#1 Coconut Margarita.  (who would have thunk that agave and coconut make great bedfellows? a first for me, now i will never go back to anything less than...)\n#2  Passion Fruit Margarita. (a contender for the number one spot. perfect balance of ingredients - so much so that one hardly tastes the tequila and instead thinks they are plucking Maracuya from the vine.)\n#3 Blackberry Margarita. (hold me back! I thought there was nothing more divine than a blackberry capirinha.)\n#4 Lychee Margarita. (this sweet and fragranced fruit makes the cadillac margarita pale in comparison)\n\nI will not admit to drinking any more than the above stated, but I did sample the other signature cocktails such as the kiwi white sangria, and the peach mojito.  With so many exotic and enticing blendings of flavors, I was overwhelmed.  The list of flavor combinations for mojitos and sangrias, as well as margaritas and martinis goes on...I only wished my liver had not been so well fortified after my drinking expedition.  I would have explored the wilds of this potable jungle, but I settled instead with putting the flowers, that came as decorative adornments in the drinks, in my hair.\n\nSo, after that wonderful veer, my focus was back on the food.  Other items my taste buds explored on the generous spread were the BBQ meat sliders, as well as the pork tostillados and guacummus.  What is guacammus?  It is Ticoz famous blend of house made guacamole and garlic hummus - a unique gathering of mediterranean and caribbean.  Go Chef Holly!\n\nWhat one will find here on the appetizer menu are the characteristic  southwestern and even south american comfort foods such as empanadas (a taste of buenos aires) and flautas.  In addition to the guacammus, the basket of corn waffle fries seasoned wtih lime and chipotle distinguishes this eatery from the rest.\n\nMore than a half dozen salads grace the menu, with unique ingredients such as grilled peaches or hearts of palm.  Burgers and sandwhiches are available for the unadventurous, but the signature dishes is where Ticoz defines itself as a Latin Restaurant.\n\nFrom the house Paella prepared in a citrus saffron broth, to the shrimp and lobster arroz in crab filled coconut rice - Ticoz will give you a small tour of the Latin World.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 5, "useful": 7, "cool": 6}}, {"text": "Ok, you definitely have to be down with the gays to like this place.

The Sangria was great but I was not a fan of the food. Considering that the drinks had been so good, I decided to give it another shot, and I am glad that I did. My second visit even got Ticoz an extra star from me.\n\nFirst visit:\n\nI came here during happy hour on a weekday night because I had been really interested in checking it out. The first thing I did was order a Passion Fruit Sangria. It was amazing by the way and tasted very homemade! I then decided to get some food. There was a lot on the menu that caught my eye, but I decided to play it safe with a burrito. The waitress then recommended the tilapia, which sounded like a winner. It's then that I noticed the toppings for the burritos; there was enchilada style and queso style. Thinking that some melted cheese on my burrito would take the taste over the top, I ordered it that way. -- Let me just say really quickly that the waitress was pretty fantastic, though she sounded a bit scripted. That's understandable though considering the place started packing in a crowd. -- Now, back to the food. I was completely baffled when I saw my burrito. It was completely covered in cheese. Normally this would have been great, but in this case it was covered in what looked to be movie theater nacho cheese. Ticoz is a swanky place so I brushed it off and gave it a taste. No joke, it tasted like movie theater nacho cheese. I had no idea what I had done to my food! When I think of \"queso style\" I think of shredded cheese melted over the burrito via a broiler or something. The contents of the burrito were delicious, but the topping soiled their flavor (I even tried to scrape it off). I left Ticoz that night wishing that I had ordered something else to eat.\n\nThis leads us to visit number two...\n\nSecond visit:\n\nThis time I decided to go for breakfast and I am pleased to say that I had a great time. Two dollars mimosas and pork chile verde in the morning hit the spot! To condense this visit to a sentence: The drinks were just as good as before and the food was great!\n\nI can now say that I like Ticoz and I am happy to be able to say so. My one request is for them to lay off the cheese sauce for their burrito.

It was fairly nice and warm out so we opted for the patio, everyone was very friendly and we were seated promptly. The place was not super busy but most everyone was on the patio and I liked the vibe. We saw others sucking down mimosa's and mojito's so we thoughy why not? We each ordered a glass of the passion fruit sangria - it was excellent. You also get a LARGE glass of sangria, not a small wine glass or cocktail glass they serve you in a more inferior establishments.\n\nI had checked some Yelp reviews quickly(don't you love Yelp mobile?!) and figured out the corn waffle fries were a must to start with, very tasty, fresh and not the typical thrown-in-a-fryer-frozen taste. \n\nI had the Grand Burrito with veggies minus the cheese. I am not a big coleslaw fan but the burrito came with the passion fruit slaw and I promptly scarfed it all down, delicious. I was expecting the burrito to be good but it was good in a different way, you could tell it had some different spices and seasonings going on then your standard Mexican-style fare. I might have picked up some curry or coriander, whatever it was in the yellow rice it really set the burrito apart. \n\nOverall this place was great, no complaints besides maybe a few more items I could veganize without completely destroying the items.

Service was good, atmosphere as good, drinks were good.  However, I do have a few concerns.   I had the lettuce wraps for my dinner. I know this is normally an appetizer, but I didn't want a heavy meal.  I asked if it would be enough for an entree and the waiter said for one person, yes.    When I received it, I was a little shocked.  It wasn't  even enough for an appetizer and I asked if it was enough for a meal.  I couldn't imagine people sharing this because it wasn't very much at all.  Not to mention it was $10.  If I paid $5 that would be understandable.\n\nThe other disappointment was the chips & salsa.  This is normally at your table minutes after you are seated.  Not this time... We received tortillas wrapped in foil with garlic butter on the side.  I thought that was strange and that now in order to get chips and salsa we had to PAY.  They have had it complimentary at your table ever since they opened, and now returning guests should not expect his anymore?  Not very impressive and it seems a little desperate to save dollars.  \n\nLike I said, I really like going to Ticoz, and enjoy the flavors and food they offer.

Place has a lot of hype and has been on our list for a while now. Atmosphere was great, lots of red, lots of latin hipsterness.\n\nOur party started off with a pitcher of the White Kiwi Sangria, the Guacamus, and the lettuce wraps. I'm not as big a fan of white sangria as red, and I thought it was good but not great. I've definitely had better. The lettuce wraps were 180 degrees from what I was expecting. (the standard pf chang's type deal) They were basically a fruit and nut compote on a thin crunchy leaf of lettuce. Really really good with the sangria. I'm also not a big fan of guacamole but the guacamus (guac and hummus spread) was pretty good, and my guac loving companions thought it was amazing. Definitely a must try.\n\nFor dinner we had a pitcher of the Passion Fruit Sangria, and my wife and I split the Grilled Peach Salad w/ chicken and the Pork Torta. Both were excellent, the Torta especially. It came with huge crosscut fries and coleslaw. The flavors of the sandwich were excellent and I was bummed to have to share half of it. The sangria was pretty good but with all the hype about it being the best sangria ever, I didn't think it was quite to that level. But still, yum.\n\nOur service was a bit slow but our waiter was super friendly and the 3 women in my party all thought he was ridiculously hot. Later in the evening he spent some time chatting with us at the table, and told us that the bar side of the restaurant is a lot of fun later at night when the restaurant side clears out. He did however forget to bring us the extra pita chips we asked for to finish off our Guacamus, which made me a sad panda.

As Hottie and I continue our quest to find a decent Mexican restaurant, again we leave feeling a bit defeated.  Ticoz looked promising; they have a diverse menu with lots of vegetarian options, decent prices, and happy hour. Arriving at about 6PM on a Friday, the parking lot was full, so we took advantage of the complimentary valet.   Although the restaurant was pretty full, we still managed to get sat right away.  Eager to try one of their signature drinks, I asked for a recommendation from the server.  He wasn't particularly helpful, so I just picked what sounded good to me, a lychee mojito.  I should have figured out when they offered so many flavor options for both the mojito's and margaritas, that they would just be adding syrup... and I lot of it!  Let's just say I am not a huge fan of overly sweet cocktails, so I was not a fan of the lychee mojito. Next I tried the signature margarita with no extra \"flavoring\". This was much better but still a little sweet for my taste.  For dinner, we started off with chips and salsa. The chips were good, they were thick cut and prepared fresh, but lacked salt.  The salsa was okay, nothing special, similar to what you find at Baja fresh. Unfortunately we ended up with a handful of extra chips and an empty bowl of salsa... and were not offered a refill.  For dinner I ordered the blue corn enchiladas vegetarian and a side of black beans.  This was by far the best part of the meal. The enchiladas were packed with flavor and not greasy at all. There was just enough cheese to satisfy my cravings, but not make me feel guilty about eating it.  Also, the vegan black beans were sooooo good, not sure what the smoky flavoring was, but I want that recipe!  For dessert we ordered a blonde brownie topped with ice cream.

Why would you ask us that? Where is our appetizer? He also didn't ask us if we wanted anything else before he brought us our bill. Just assumed we were finished. I have to say the service here is not so good. Also, when we went in today the people working the host station were all over the place. They would answer the phones and then talk to the people who came in at the same time. Seems rude to the people on the phone.

Likewise, the personnel doesn't dazzle. Not that Ticoz was ever stocked with ebullient, outgoing personalities, but it seems on most nights that the service staff can't wait to get the heck out of dodge. Nobody has been downright rude...but nobody has been particularly welcoming either. I miss the old guard, the old menu, the old Ticoz.

Saturday night found me with two wonderful friends looking at a menu that was overwhelming.  The whole experience started much as every restaurant experience starts.  Greeting, seating, menus, panic attack.  The server (who was lovely, but who's name I cannot remember) came by to ask what we would like.  Given that all of us have some dietary challenges, we start throwing the questions at him.  He doesn't know the answers, but he vows to figure it out. Usually, this does not end well, see the open letter to our sandbar server.  We just get back to our conversation when chef Holly appears at our table.  Everything on the menu is her brainchild and she knows exactly how to answer every one of our questions. \n\nNot only did Chef Holly answer our questions, she created an entirely new dish for one friend (it was incredible), whipped up a lemon apricot vinaigrette salad dressing with enough for leftover containers, and took back my chicken when it came covered in parsley.  All this is impressive, but what made the experience incredible was her attitude.  It was obvious that she was excited about food.  She saw the challenge in creating something for us.  She told us that no one has ever gotten sick from her food and she was going to make sure we weren't the first. \n\nIn the end, all the service is amazing, the atmosphere is wonderful, and the staff is great.

The overall experience wasn't the awesomest tonight. The BF and I went to try this place tonight as we had a deal from phoenix Voice. We were sat by the very nice bartender (but in the dining room). This restaurant is so cute! The decor is so classy looking and they really took the time to make the details nice, including the bathroom sinks, which were really nice looking. We got a pitcher of the white sangria, as it was half off and it was really good! Our waiter was very attentive... at least at first. He made a great suggestion for my dinner, the blue corn enchiladas... holy crap, it was sooo good! My only complaint was when I said I wanted to get just the one enchilada he was a little pushy on trying to get me to get the full dinner.... I wanted to make sure I had room for dessert, so I got the smaller plate, and despite his pushing, I was glad I did because it was the perfect amount for me... no need to spend an extra 4$ on food I couldn't eat. I know he wasn't trying to be pushy, it just came off that way a little. The BF got the burrito, which was just alright. Nothing like my enchilada. Whoa... the green sauce and the cheeses and chicken all blended together in amazing deliciousness. Please order this dish. super Yum. I also got a side of the guacummus.... genius! This stuff was so tasty and something I have never heard of anywhere else. So then we wanted to get the dessert I was saving room for (although there wasn't much saved) and asked for the waiter's suggestion. He suggested the tortilla pudding... which is what we were thinking about, but then remembered they ran out! Noooo!!! That was such a let down! We didn't end up getting dessert as that was what we really wanted. It was probably a good thing though.\n\n So finally we go to pay and they manager was unable to find my name on their Voice deals list at first... then the manager found it, but accidentally took it off of the table next to our's bill and charged my card for the remainder of their bill.... oops! It took awhile for anyone to come around, as it had gotten fairly busy and there was only one waiter. The manager was really good about fixing the problem, so that was nice.

We came in around 2:30 and were asked where we'd like to sit.  We asked for \"the comfiest seat in the house\" and were shown to the cabana outside.   Perfect!  \n\nBecause we were there at an odd hour, there weren't a lot of other customers competing for our server's attention.  He was delightful, attentive without being too present.  \n\nThe sangrias were really solid - and enormous. Good balance of fruit and booze.  Our server recommended the cocount curry chicken, and with good reason.  It was excellent.  My only complaint is that the chicken was that it was obviously added after the coconut curry rice base. (Which is great, it can be a solid vegetarian option) but the chicken flavor didn't compliment the rest of the dish.  It had a sort of Latin flavor while the curry was decidedly Asian.  It was served with some tortilla chips stuck in the curry, and s it turned out, I ended up eating the chicken with the chips separately, so it was like two dishes in one.  Weird. They were both great, but if I did it again, I would sitr the chicken in to the curry myself and hope that once I did that the flavors would be more complimentary.\n\nBF got the paella, which was a seafood rice dish.  Really really nice.  Excellent choice, and while it was a hefty $18 it could easily have been lunch for two.  Easily.  Between the two of us, we brought more home with us than we were able to eat, as my dish was also absurdly generous.  Smaller portion options would likely have been a good idea, especially for lunch. \n\nSince we were there for a leisurely afternoon, with nowhere else to be, and reasonable expectations about the food, it was a resounding success.

We ordered chips and salsa, and the salsa was bland, kind of tasted like one of those 99 cent cans of salsa from food city.  I ordered a grilled chicken burrito.

He then asked what sauce I wanted on top, red, green etc.  cha-ching another $1.95.  Not to  be the master of complaining here,  but my $12.95 burrito was now a nearly $18.00 burrito.  I know I had the groupon,  but the point is I should love an $18.00 burrito.  I should go home, think about it, dream about, tell me friends about the best burrito in town, and try to mimic the ingredients to create my at home version.  The chicken was dry, the $1.95 red sauce tasted bland, I kept wishing for some hot sauce.

I ordered the Grilled Burrito with no dairy, topped with red sauce, with a side of guaccamus. The server suggested grilled vegetables inside, so I agreed. When my order came out, I reminded the server for the side of guaccamus, and she told me the cook put it inside on accident. I said it was fine, and proceeded to cut into the burrito. Inside I discovered no rice, a few beans; basically a grilled vegetable runny guaccamus mess. She came by so I apologized for being difficult but pointed out this is not what I ordered and wasn't what I wanted it. She apologized and told me the cook had made it wrong the first time, so this was his second try, and she took it back. Once my food came out, the burrito has shrunk half to its original size, but it was 2:30, so I thanked her and ate it anyway. She took my burrito off the check; so once again, I had the Village Voice deal to use.\n\nYesterday, I called and told the woman on the phone I had the coupon and I wanted to place a to-go order. I ordered the to-go guaccamus, which is on the menu under A La Carte. I've ordered it before, so I know it comes in a large container. I also ordered chicken lettuce wraps; the woman on the phone said I could get the lunch order for cheaper and half the size. Since I was only ordering for myself but looking to spend $30 on the coupon, I agreed with her suggestion. So as a second thought, I told her I would take the Taco Salad as well, no dairy, dressing on the side. She asked if I wanted chicken, and I calculated that this would put me over $30 so I could run a tip on my debit card, so once again I agreed with her suggestion.\n\nWhen I got to the restaurant, I presented the girl at the bar with my coupon and as she was giving me a receipt for $27, I was bombarded by a flustered, rude older man in a dress shirt practically shouting at me it was dine-in only. I explained to him that I had been there before to try and use it but my order was wrong, so is there anyway I could be made an exception? He grabbed my receipt and went to the register, and brought me back a receipt for $2, saying the order went over the total. I felt bad so I tipped her $7. He walked away and I reminded her I told her about it on the phone: she took the blame and apologized. I was really uncomfortable so I went back to my car. Before I left, checked my order.\n\nThe first box had the half order of chicken lettuce wraps: check. The second was the taco salad, which appeared to me to be iceberg lettuce and grilled chicken on top, with no much else. No dressing. Then I opened the third container, which had one side of guaccamus and a million fried wonton chips. So I went back inside because the one thing I really wanted, the to-go guaccamus, was wrong. Once again I was bombarded by this older man, yelling at the server across the bar she would have to ring me up separately, while she told me that I ordered the guaccamus a la carte, and so that is what I ordered. My receipt was still on the bar, so I opened it up and looked at the bill. I had been rung up for a full order of chicken lettuce wraps, the taco salad plus chicken, and one side of guaccamus, which obviously is not what I ordered. At this point I was starting to get angry so I just grabbed my food and left. It was once I got back to my office that I realized I had paid $9, on top of the $15 I already paid for my Village Voice Deal, for a side of guacamole, some wontons I didn't want, three small lettuce wraps and the worst salad I'd ever seen.\n\nNever.

The first time I came here was almost 4 years ago, and the last was about a month ago for a birthday. All experiences about the same - actually, no - I'd say they have progressively gotten worse. \n\nI know it is a popular spot, and I won't argue with someone who loves this place, but I find it a bit confused and overpriced for the quality. It's cute, I suppose, for a CenPho spot. (I may be putting down some CenPho spots that really make the effort!). But I would have to say the food and drinks here are about as tacky as the interior decorating. I cannot remember having anything I really felt was worth finishing the plate here. I had a chicken burrito last time which was pretty bland, served with some sort of BBQ/refried beans that confused my mouth and the rest of the dish. I will say, I like the little cornbread/cake scoop you get on your plate. The most memorable thing I have have eaten here. \n\nWe also ordered their flavored Sangria pitcher ($25!!!)...a huge pitcher that is really just about 3 glasses total due to the amount of ice they use in both the pitcher and the glasses, and tasted like grown-up KoolAid as if the flavor came from some sort of Pucker's additive. Actually, I remember going to Ticoz for the first time for their Martini night and I had to send back 2 of them because that's all they were, vodka and Pucker's. Gross. \n\nThis last time we were here, for the friend's birthday dinner, we had a large group and were sat in the corner booths. Seating was fine, we knew we were a large group, but we felt like we were a burden for the server and felt more processed than really served.

We dined at TeePee's Friday, and then Ticoz Saturday for the party and we both highly agreed that, though they are very different in ambiance, style, food, etc., we would much rather go and eat at TeePee's again, spend half the amount of money and enjoy ourselves. \n\nIn a time when most places are going for freshness, quality and style - I just hope things keep up for 'em.

I heard mwah mwah mwah VODKA...and then something that sounded like a Bay Breeze. Then Jordan recommend a \"Big Girl Mimosa\".

Not really a big deal, but, per discussion with the two other adults at the table, none of us heard the additional pricing for the shot. (Nor did the highly intellectual teenager.)

Huevos Ranchero\n3. Hot Cake Trio with Schreiner's Sausage\n\nThe Lobster Egg Benedict really is something. It's hard to describe.

To use my usual sound for food this was \"Hhhhhooooohhhhh my good.\" Yeah, that good. GET IT.\n\nThe kid at the table went for the Mexican Eggs Benedict. He pretty much orders chorizo at every restaurant in Phoenix. (I don't understand teenagers.) Buuut, if anyone is an expert on chorizo, I'd say this smarty pants would be. He liked it. I did it too.

I have to give them major credit for the cheddar chipotle mashed potatoes, the chicken was a little dry and the goat cheese was tasteless. I really thought that the apricot or the mushroom would give it a flavor but no. However, the balsamic sauce on top was delightful. You SHOULD try the potatoes. \n\nFinally, the flan. I did enjoy the flan but I wonder why they make it so thick. I don't like a watery flan as much as the next person, but this was pretty thick!

I'm big fan of horchata and was just expecting a stronger cinnamon flavor, not to mention I'm pretty sure there is no rice in this dessert.  The bread pudding was good, especially with the slightly melted chocolate chips and candied walnuts on top, but nothing resembling horchata. On a positive note, it was served with the most amazing cookies and cream ice cream I've ever tried. Id have been happier just getting a large scoop of that (next time!)\n3) tilapia tacos- ahhh... spicy but tolerable, perfectly cooked, great blend of flavors. The fact that everytime I order these the tortilla falls apart and I end up eating it with a fork does nothing to dissway me from them. Terrific!\n4) pernil quesadilla- and here is the reason I'm hooked. The most tender and flavorful pork inside a perfectly chewy/crispy tortilla, with gooey happiness inside. I'm in love.

I would think they would at least open the doors, but nope. So that was a bad start.

Both were pretty lack luster. First off, the food came out really fast... like it was all premade fast... and it wasn't really hot, just kind of warm. Like other people have said, the chicken sounds really good but actually comes out kind of bland. The menu says the chicken is pounded but my chicken was like 2 inches thick, so that was weird. The breading wasn't really crispy and the whole thing just wasn't that good. The bf's pork was also kind of bland, even with the dipping sauce that came with it. The sides were alright (mashed potatoes, corn bread, carrots-these didn't have a ton of flavor). Despite the food being underwhelming, we did decide to order dessert. This is why I gave this restaurant 2 stars. The banana burrito was delicious! I wish I had just eaten this for dinner. \nSo we get our check and I have a 30$ groupon.

I'm terrible cooking fish, and I do better.\n\nWhat shined were the side dishes.  I dislike cornbread normally, but the cornbread caserole was filling and outstanding.

Shared plate #2 - new york strip, cheddar mashed potatoes and organic green beans were all just OK. Not a fan of the sauce the steak was in, and topping of mushrooms, onions and peppers too heavy. Way too much mashed potatoes and green beans, which were both pretty bland.\n6. Toward the end of our meal, a young boy came into the restaurant and started playing with a ball right next to our table.

In my opinion, this is one of those restaurants that is making a killing off Groupon and other promotions. I think that we're now seeing a certain type of restaurant emerge that actually LIVES OFF OF those \"daily deal promotions.\" While my wife and I were eating, I saw two other transactions in which someone handed the Groupon coupon to the waiter. \n\nThat's OK if its normally priced, or a good deal, because than Groupon is introducing you to something special and you're getting an even better deal.

These prices at a place where you have to sit on rinky-dink plastic outdoor furniture with wobbly tables just like you might see at the \"patio\" outside some cheazy taco joint or fast food place.\n\nMy wife ordered a THIRTEEN DOLLAR appetizer, because it was one of the cheaper things on the menu and it included four scallops that someone had squirted some sauce over. That's it. LIterally gone in four bites. While my dish was larger, and the pork and mashed potatoes tasted good, it just didn't make our expectations after reading Yelp reviews.\n\nI like to support small, hidden out of the way places, and I enjoy the kind of latin fare that this restaurant promotes. But I'd like to see fair treatment of the customer first and foremost. Offering a pint of draft beer at a fair price and a mojito special would be one way to start on that path, Fuego.

Supposedly this place is known for their Mojitos, but as a huge fan of Mojitos, I can tell you that the Mojito is simply \"Ok\".  They use Monin syrup for their flavorings so dont expect an actual prickly pear or blood orange in your mojito.  The other drink we got was a Carribean Volcano which was made with SoCo and some other medely...but all I could taste was Pineapple.  Ok so drinks aren't their thing....on to the food.\n\nCourse 1:  There was 4-5 things to choose from but the two that caught our eyes were the Salmon Croquette and the Chili Empanada.  From what I hear, the Empanada is also something that Fuego Bistro is known for.  I dont know if maybe I got unlucky but I really did not care for the Empanada.  The shell was crispy and tasty but the beef filling was bland and boring.  The pico de gaio sprinkled on top did not really do anything to the dish either.  In contrast...the Salmon Croquette was amazing...I want to go back and order a whole meal of that! lol.  The salmon was perfectly mixed with the other spices in the Croquette and it was cooked perfectly.\n\nCourse 2:  We got the Pernil Asada and the Tilapia.  Both dishes were tasty and I cant say anything bad about them, I also cannot say anything great about them either.  The Tilapia was basically Country Fried with a mild sauce on top and the Pernil Asada was a well executed pulled pork.  Each dish came with 2 sides and I can safely say that the side dishes impressed me more then the main course.  The creamed corn was heavenly, the Mashed Potatoes were delicious and the cornbread was phenomenal....(im out of adjectives, sue me)  The Green Beans were cooked well but needed seasoning...simply adding some salt fixed that problem.\n\nCourse 3:  We got the Bread Pudding and the Chocolate Torte.  Both were served with a scoop of ice cream that had chocolate slivers in it.  I gotta say, the bread pudding was awesome...I wish there was more of it, though im sure my waistline is glad there wasent.

So I never returned... \nYears later, I started my search to go back to that great little cafe, only to find out it changed to Fuego Bistro. I was sad at first, until I saw the menu online. Soooooo up my alley. I love delicious spicy mixes of Latin and American cuisines. Restaurant week came and Fuego was on the list and they were including a cocktail with our 3 course dinner. Hells yeah!! Definitely my kind of place! \nHere's the meal rundown: \n1st course: I got the empanada. So sad it wasn't empanadas. I could eat these for every meal for the rest of my life and never once complain of monotony. My buddy got the tostadas. Lucky him, he got two. I stole some of his beef that was on top and it was melt in my mouth delicious. So far, 2 for 2. \n2nd course: I got the chili relleno with jalapeno creamed corn and chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes. O-M-G!!!! I don't even know where to start. The corn definitely had a kick and was made sweet white corn which added a nice balance to the spice. I have since bought sweet white corn and jalapenos to try to recreate these. It won't be as good; but that just means I'll be heading back. If I could make mashed potatoes this good, I'd move to Idaho. The chili relleno was bomb-diggity. Chicken, black beans, cheese, love. \nMy friend had the signature pernil asado and the same sides as me. I hardly got the chance to try his he ate it so fast. Signature for a reason. YUMMMMMMY! \nScore: 4 for 4. \n3rd course: I got the horchata chocolate chip bread pudding. I was so full I could not fully appreciate this giant plate of wonderfulness. My friend got the creme brulee and it was just as fantastic, but I'm going to say this round goes to the bread pudding. \n6 for 6. \nAs for the included cocktail, I had the white sangria. I love sangria. It was a perfect blend of sweet and crisp and didn't have too much fruit or wine flavor to it. It was strong and I could only make it through one. \nThe server was super friendly, the atmosphere fantastic, the food to die for, and the drinks strong and delicious.

We all agreed to stick to Cowboy Ciao's short ribs. The Cajun Blackened fish too came our over cooked to the point it was hardly eaten.  The pulled pork was extra tender, but lacked in flavor as well.  My strip was cooked perfectly, but I could have the same steak at Applebee's.  Unfortunately the main dishes were far from what we had expected after reading the reviews of the restaurant.  All the portions were large, but it didn't help as the food was mediocre.  On a good note, the sides were all awesome!  Fuego brought the much needed spice to the valley with their sides.  Then we all shared a piece of their key lime pie with coffee.  We believe the coffee was a generic Folgers at best.  However, the pie, especially the crust, was some of the best key lime pie we had eaten since being in the keys several years ago.  All in all, we had great company with a poor choice of a restaurant as none of us will be heading back to Fuego Bistro.  My recommendations are if you do choose to try this place, go during the winter and only order the appetizers and desserts.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "The short: Mouthwatering Cuban-influenced cuisine, awesome service, cute and warmly decorated space with a cool mix of art all over the walls. This is a restaurant I'll be going back to. \n\nThe long: \nFuego Bistro is off the east side of 7th St., just south of Bethany Home. Keep an eye out for the sign that says Apollo and turn in just north of that building. Fuego Bistro is next door to Apollo, and the small main parking lot is on the east side of the restaurant, but there's parking, sometimes makeshift, up and down Palo Verde Dr. If you're brave, or dumb, you can try to use the spot with the power pole growing out of it. \n\nI liked the look of the place--not too loud (visually or otherwise), and cozy without looking homely. I love the art there. The diners represented an even spread, which is always nice to see. The restaurant smelled like pork, but not in a scary way--it smelled like their famous pernil asado. The host was friendly, and the rest of the service staff was wonderful--fast, efficient, and totally unobtrusive, sliding silverware and refills in as needed before slipping quietly away, doing quality control checks after we'd taken a couple of bites of each course. That was especially impressive, considering out table was just big enough for the two of us. \n\nWe split the appetizers. First we had the green chile cheeseburger empanadas with Yucatan BBQ Sauce, and fresh pico de gallo. While a lot of food can get by solely on the merit of being fried as long as they're fried well, as these were, the filling and accompaniments were so yummy. All the flavors melded together beautifully, and the pico de gallo added the fresh zest and bright flavor I wanted to start off the meal. We also had the Ancho-dusted Pacific wild salmon croquette with fresh capers and lemon buerre blanc. This was also well done and tasty, though it took a backseat to the empanada for me. \n\nMy entree was the signature pernil asado, which the restaurant describes as \"slow roasted succulent pork shoulder with a mango habanero mojo sauce.\" And it absolutely was as mouthwatering as its description implies. This was as good as any pernil asado I've ever had, and while I can't attest to Fuego Bistro's recipe, I can definitely say it tasted like a hunk of luscious meat that's been marinated overnight and roasted low and slow for 5 or 6 hours before landing on my plate. *sigh* It came with a continuous supply of little flour tortillas, tasty chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes, and perfectly cooked and delicious sauteed organic green beans. \n\nMy boyfriend has the Fuego chile relleno, which was stuffed with \"Natural Chicken, Black Bean, arroz, Oaxacan cheese, Penko Breaded in a Guajillo Chile Sauce.\" This dish was also really good and well cooked, but I was more impressed with his side dishes--a highly addictive green chili cornbread casserole and maple chiliglazed carrots, which were the best cooked carrots I've ever had. Between my green beans and his carrots, I was totally happy. If you make veggies as if they were a boring obligation or afterthought, you lose major points. I eat my veggies first before any other part of the entree, and if I don't want to go into my main dish feeling sad. Fuego Bistro does veggies right. \n\nFor dessert, we had the Ancho dusted chocolate torte and the horchata chocolate chip bread pudding. Dessert's often the highlight of a dinner out for me, and while both were good in this case with the chocolate torte being my choice, it doesn't bother me at all that the first and second courses were the stars of the meal. Bonus points for the bartender who was so willing and gracious as to translate their extensive mojito menu into virgin drinks for us, since we weren't drinking that night. We would not turn down another round of watermelon and mango mojitos, and I'm looking forward to trying more of their menu.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I enjoyed this place.

I felt the restaurant concept was a little confused given the choice of sides which don't necessarily pair well with every entree. I had the seared ahi tuna which was topped with a balsamic reduction and a mango/red pepper/avocado salsa. It was cooked properly but underseasoned except for the balsamic reduction which was nothing but sweet. Perhaps the blandness of this dish could be remedied with chili and lime and salt, but regardless, it did not deliver on taste. I chose to have the chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes and sauteed green beans as side dishes. The green beans were the best of the two, simple and tender, but the potatoes were lacking in flavor. Chipotle was only hinted at and the cheese was entirely understated. I know there has to be a way to elevate this food, but Fuego has fallen short. \n\nMy roommate was in agreement that the meal was not a hit. Even the Key Lime Pie for dessert did not make the grade.

First off, they have a small--probably 8 tables at most and that's counting several 2 person tiny tables--cafe offstreet in an alley.  We had a little problem finding it with the gps but we did.  He does have tons of parking, tho, across the street so that's no problem for those of you who worry.\nWhen we went last night in mid-January he had plenty of tables outside with many people sitting out there and even his hostess podium there, too.  Very smart move.\nNobody seemed to mind it was winter and sitting outside, so I can only guess it was suitably warm out there.  We, however, were sat inside right next to the kitchen.  But, then again, if you are inside the cafe you will always be somewhat close to the kitchen.\nNow, the service:  Either this owner has told his servers to realllly take care of the patrons or we got the world's greatest server.  This gal (I'm guess 40's, long blonde hair) first gave us when we said we'd order sangria 2 tastes of both white and red for us to decide which one.  We went with the white that night.  It was good, but, having lived in Spain, it wasn't really authentic sangria.  Where was the fruit that always goes in sangria a la Spain?  Oh well...still good tasting.\nThe lady server also gave us 2 free empanadas for me and my gal pal to taste.  OMG!  I have never ever liked empanadas because the crust is always crap and the filling is always dry or dull.  But these empanadas...like nothing I have ever tried before:  judgment is fantastically delicious!\nWe both ordered the pork dinner which is pork shoulder (pulled pork to you) sans any sauce which comes on the side.  It's a whitish sauce--I think they called it mole or moro or something--that was light and delicious to me.  I poured it all over my huge portion of pork.\nI also ordered the special potatoes (wonderful!) and the creamed corn (a tad jalapeno hot for me but not bad at all).  My friend ordered the jalapeno bread, and I will get that next time as she gave me a taste....and, again, delicious.\nI consider myself somewhat of a foodie, and I say this place is soooo worth going to again and again.

By definition they are usually very tiny with onions,some guacamole, a little cabbage, and some small cuts of meat.  I can say the tilapia tacos are tops(large filet on each) on the list of my girlfriend's quest for good fish tacos. I can say the pork nachos are the best I have had as the pork reminds me of Los Dos Molinos in a small way. The empanadas are excellent as well.\n\nIf you go for happy hour you can get two empanadas for 6 bucks. You can also get 2 large fish tacos for 6 bucks. Would you like some awesome tortilla soup? 4 bucks.\nIf you get the dinner version of the emapanadas with a large portion of some of the best rice and a side of black beans I think it sets you back about 11 bucks. I have also had the chili relleno and it is the best I have tasted as well leaving me to wonder with the single review you have for anything, why the venom?\n\nI learned long ago to ask for what is recommended for before you order and if someone recommends a place try what they are harping about first. When I asked they said the chili relleno, pork, empanadas, and red sangrias. Guess how my dining experience went? Try ordering tacos from Los Dos Molinos and you will leave pissed. Order the green chili pork and you will drive 100 miles for it.\n\nI do hope you give it another chance I have honestly never had anything sub par here in my 7 or so visits and they seriously could charge way more for quality than they do.  I agree that Main Ingredient is great also, that's why I took the time to write about it. \n\nBut to reiterate:\n\n11-13 dollar for most dinner items besides new york strip(on the list to try), is not pricey\n\nhappy hour has most items for 4-6$\n\nstreet tacos are not bursting with meat\n\nask what is the best thing on the menu when you order some place then you can write it off all you want.\n\nHumble Pie  was more pricey and not worth it, All it does is take up parking from a much better place next door. For a place with the reference to pizza in it's name you would think it would be better, it tasted like peter piper.\n\nI would love to know what a good chicken taco is in your opinion, I cant think of any besides maybe the California tacos at the now closed Chuy's, but the ones my sister ordered from here were full of chicken and topped with a nice chipotle/ranch like sauce which is similar.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "For a romantic dinner, the patio of this small cafe is beautiful at night.

I am rating both visits in this review.   I did not know this place existed until the Groupon, but the first time I went, I had a memorably negative experience with, I think, the owner.  he talked like he was the owner and he had \"owner profit concerns\" that an employee would not voice.  He was a heavier man about age 40, 5'10\", dishwater blond hair. \n\n The Groupon required reservations, but when I called and said I was coming at 5 pm, the waitress said I did not need reservations, just come on in.  I was dining alone.  When I walked in, the owner/manager did not believe me that someone on his staff would tell me I did not need reservations.  He told me nothing was available, but I saw only about 2 parties sitting on the patio, a few more inside.  I was upset that I was told I did not need reservations, and here he was turning me away.  Well, he said, that I could sit at the bar and eat my dinner,when I wanted to sit at the patio.  He also whined that he was not making any money on the Groupon.  I was not happy that he was denying me to eat there, when his staff told me I didn't need reservations.    I told him that I cannot be responsible for what his staff tells me, and if he was unhappy about losing money via Groupon, he should not have advertised his deal with them.  I think I sounded like I was going to give him a bad review, so after about 15 min of arguing, and not being seated anywhere, he told me that I could have a patio table.  After all we were arguing for 15 min and if the tables were all reserved, certainly no one showed up for their reservation at that time, and the patio was almost empty.\n\nSince I was dining alone, I picked the most expensive item on the menu, which was the steak, to use my $30 Groupon myself.  This owner/manager became my waiter.  As I said, I think he thought I was going to give him a bad review as we had all this conflict as soon as I walked in.\n\nI then realized that since I was dining alone, he did not want me to occupy a nice patio table for 4 on the patio, where he could make more money serving 4 people, so he wanted me to sit at the bar.  Even tho tables were not fully reserved, they had the POTENTIAL to be.  I was eating $30 worth of food and he was making only $5, which he even TOLD ME !  He made me feel like I was being punished for buying the Groupon !\n\nWell he changed his attitude as my server, and became a very very gracious waiter.  The steak was PERFECTLY COOKED  (I ordered rare), and soooo pleasing and delicious!   The sides he recommended were terrific.  He seemed to make up for his rudeness as manager, when he became my server, tho his \"regrets as manager\" were unspoken.\n\nThe second time I went, was about a year later.  $30 Groupon required minimum party of 2, so I invited 2 friends.  This Groupon only said reservations \"recommended\", not required, and I did make reservations.  \n\nWe ordered the Angus shortrib entree, the tilapia, and I had the seafood chilli relleno entree.  The sides were A+, and the serving size enormous.  I am a big eater.  The servings were so large that I recommend that people pay the $5 share cost, and share a dinner.  I made 3 meals out of what I was served.  The tilapia was bland to me, and I would have liked the Angus shortrib to have more sauce, but that is me.  My friends did not have my comments.  I am a picky eater. \n\nWe had two waiters, one said he did not know the menu because he had only worked there for one day, so he said to ask another waiter.   I always ask servers what are their regular customers' favorite dishes.  I have no complaints about our service, I would rate B+.  \n\nI would have given this place 5 stars if it were not for my bad experience with the owner the first time.  \n\nOur total bill was $69 before tax and tip and we got $30 off that.  \n\nI would come back here again without Groupon discount, which I cannot say for about 95% of the Groupon, Living Social, DealChicken, etc. deals.  It is a nice place to bring a visitor from out of town to sit on the patio, which is entirely shaded from 5:00 on.

Chicken was cooked perfectly and I really liked the sauce which managed to be creamy but not too rich. We chose the cornbread and creamed corn for our sides. The cornbread was yummy - light, fluffy, a little spicy - but I would past on the creamed corn next time. Too sweet and nothing special. \n\nFinally, we split the key lime pie for dessert.

I'd never eaten here before, but I know from the reviews that it's popular for happy hour.  Indeed, the HH menu sounds fantastic, and so do the prices.  However, these certificates were only good for dinner, and so here we were.  But first, about the location-- it's tucked away a bit, away from the road, so don't blink, or you might miss it.  There are many parking spaces, so that's not an issue unless you're there for HH.  (If you are, then come early.)  FB has a small patio area that looks promising, if only it was decorated a little better.  I remember seeing two tables, but cousin remembers four.  I don't think there are misters to help keep cool.  Inside, it's even smaller.  I would say about six tables of two- and four-tops, and about five to six seats at the beautiful blue-tiled bar.  Sit here to maximize on atmosphere, have questions about the wines or cocktails, and if you want to be entertained by the staff.\n\nMy cousin doesn't drink, so she had water, while I tried the guava mojito.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA?select=pCA97HLAPYRN0bJTQUs1Pw#pCA97HLAPYRN0bJTQUs1Pw  It tasted like a regular mojito, but a bit sweeter.  It's alright- nothing fantastic.  Maybe I'll try a regular one, without the added flavorings, during HH one of these days.  After poring through the menu and asking our server Steve (who is also the bartender) about the dinner special (ribeye), I found I could only try ONE item, since everything else had allergens all over the entrees (shellfish, corn, guacamole, bell peppers, dijon reduction, etc.), instead of just added on top, and so I ordered the Natural Farm Chicken Breast, with tomatillo sauce, pico de gallo, goat cheese, and bacon. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA?select=o8X2VwUplwqRZfvuQUunDA#o8X2VwUplwqRZfvuQUunDA  My cousin ordered the ribeye special, with mushrooms and a dijon reduction.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA?select=fMtwu_Aw8ynU-gaOspzWWQ#fMtwu_Aw8ynU-gaOspzWWQ  Entrees come with your choice of two sides from the following choices: green chile cornbread casserole, jalapeno creamed corn, sauteed organic green beans, chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes, and maple-glazed carrots.  Cousin chose the cornbread and creamed corn, and I asked for the green beans and mashed potatoes.\n\nCousin LOVED everything on her plate!  She especially liked the cornbread.  I enjoyed my dish, as well.  I liked how spicy it was, which may turn some people off, but I thought everything worked well together, especially the addition of the goat cheese, which helped to cut the spiciness.  I say add more cheese!  Loved the bacon bits, as well.  The green beans were sauteed to perfection-- nice green color and crisp, and not greasy.  We both thought the mashed potatoes were very tasty!  It's a good thing I liked the dish, since it's the only one I can order, unless they offer something new as a special.  \n\nWe were too stuffed to order dessert, and it's a good thing, too, since out of the five choices (Ancho chocolate torte, Banana burrito, Kahlua creme brulee, Horchata bread pudding, and Homemade Key Lime pie), I could only have the brulee, and I wasn't feeling like creme brulee that evening.  \n\nPrices were too high for me to consider dining here for dinner without a discount.

The chicken is as good as I remembered it, but this time there was even less goat cheese!  However, the creme brulee made up for it.

I have to say, I was a little disappointed in the place.  Based on all the high reviews, I was expecting something... I don't know, more.  The restaurant itself is really, really small and the seating is not exactly comfortable. I saw the nice patio but even that is in a courtyard without anything particularly interesting to look at.  I did like the overall decor and vibrant colors on the wall so I am not saying it is ugly or anything, just not as fab as I was expecting based on the reviews.\n\nThe menu was also really small.  There is not much to choose from, really.  We started with the empanadas which were a bit of a disappointment.  They just didn't have the same flavors or texture as other versions I have eaten at Mexican or South American places.  And it was weird that they were served with a sauce, especially one that didn't seem to complement them at all.  Fortunately our main courses were much better than the starter.  I ordered the prawns and my husband got the steak.  We both ordered the chipotle mashed potatoes and cornbread.  Usually, the first time we go somewhere new I try to order something completely different from hubby so we can sample more items but who can turn down chipotle mashed potatoes?  I make a version of these at home but I have never tried putting cheddar cheese in them.  I will definitely do that from now on because these tasted fantastic. They were really creamy and delicious with great flavor but not too spicy.  I didn't eat all of mine b/c they were a little too rich but hubby practically licked his plate.  The cornbread was equally divine.  In addition to the green chili chunks in there it also had pieces of crispy bacon.  The flavor and texture was just perfect!  The steak and prawns were both cooked perfectly and with really scrumptious sauces that complimented the meat perfectly.  Our waiter was really friendly throughout the whole experience and made sure we were happy with everything.\n\nOverall, the food was delicious but necessarily anything unique.  In my opinion, it just didn't justify the high prices.  We spent over $80 on our meals and a couple of beers.

OK admit I liked him because he played Dylan and Leonard Cohen among others. I was enjoying the vibe until, as the evening grew darker, I realized we could not see our food, like, at all.

So much effort clearly went into making the food, so come on, let's see it.\nMy other comment is the serving sizes. I expected that a menu such as the restaurant week menu might have smaller servings and they definitely could have. Nearly everyone I saw leaving was taking a box with them, as we did. With full size appetizers, we only ate half of our full sized main dishes. BF had to bring his dessert home, although I pressed on to try the chocolate chile torte with the most amazing malt and coconut ice cream.

They all cater to a bit different crown and have a different vibe and, aside from a few staples, different menus. This one, Fuego Bistro, is by far my favorite.\n\nI love this restaurant. I'm not a foodie, not a snob, don't give half a crap about the historic atmosphere and unique setting or vibe. In fact, I don't even eat there (I almost always get it to go). BUT MY GOD THE FOOD IS SO DAMN DELICIOUS.\n\nI've tried a number of their dishes. I'm not a fan of spicy (very finicky stomach)... I never cease to be impressed with this place. The food definitely has a unique zing to it, very flavorful, but still somehow doesn't kill my tummy. It's not overpowering, but unique. The flavors and textures really work well, too (and I'm not one to normally give a hoot about things like \"textures\"). Even I know that it's VERY well made, well-thought-out food.\n\nKinda small menu, but everything is so good. I prefer the dinner menu - it is quite different from the lunch menu. Not cheap, not expensive, very generous portions. Well worth it. It really is fusion, like none other I've ever tasted - I can't describe it using anything other than \"INCREDIBLE\"!\n\nSome of my favorites:\n - Empanadas (wow)\n - Dinner Menu Chili Relleno (oh my god - it has mahi mahi, mini scallops, shrimp, and other deliciousness). Definitely get the jalapeno creamed corn as one of your sides, they are perfect together.\n - Steak (get the mashed potatoes as one of your sides)\n - Prawns (amazing)\n\nTo the people that said their shrimp was probably from Trader Joe's, their food was bland, the service was bad, or the experience was \"just MEH\" you must be THOSE people, the ones who always have to bitch about something. I've been here at least ten times now, and I've never gotten anything but perfection. It may not look like the Ritz, but you definitely won't be disappointed.\n\nVery personable, nice staff, good and quick service the one time I ate in, lightning fast service when I do take out... even when they are packed. What I love - even when I go in there with a LivingSocial voucher, they treat me well. EVERY single time, whether it's dine-in or to-go. Usually when you use a voucher and order to-go, the hostess's face reads 'I'm not getting a tip' and you get service to match. Not here! Truly impressed. Also, I've noticed elsewhere that to-go portions get stingy compared to if you dined in. Also not here - the to-go portions are still huge!!!\n\nThey get busy on weekend evenings (especially during fall/winter - patio season), so make reservations.\n\nMy SINGLE gripe: They have limited seating, and most of it is patio (very little inside seating, small place). I'm not a people-person, I like my privacy and personal space... I like to tuck away in a corner. This is impossible inside (it's a not-very-large rectangle, there just isn't an out-of-the-way table)... it's kinda possible with some of the courtyard patio seating, but I don't really like to eat outside.

We shared the Ancho Chile chocolate torte which came with a heap of yummy ice cream and drizzled with an amazing sauce. \nThe service was wonderful, everyone was so attentive and friendly which impressed me as often when servers approach a table with one parent, a child, and a coupon, they tend to shy away. I guess they think, \"Small tip.\" Not the case here. We were treated very well and never had an empty glass or dirty dish waiting. The server was so friendly and chatted with us as well as wait on us. The atmosphere is very cute. We sat outside as there is much more seating on the patio (a courtyard for a small complex).

I grew up in the neighborhood, but after all these years I FINALLY sat down to dine at this place.  My family took me here for my birthday.  Would've sat outside, but a monsoon rolled through so we settled for interior accommodations with a view of the bar.  Being a newbie, I pretty much stuck to anything on the menu that said \"signature\" on them.  So started with their \"signature\" empanadas.  Wow, were those awesome.  Almost look like a meat turnover, but packed with flavors across the board.  Also went with their \"signature\" pulled pork.  Grabbed their cheddar chipotle mashed potatoes and green beans too.  The pulled pork was tender as can be.  The orange sauce that came with it was sweet, but had an almost ferocious spiciness to it that caught me be surprise.  The mashed potatoes were excellent and I used those to absord the meat juices leftover.  The green beans were good, but nothing special.  Washed it all down with a red sangria.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the prices were on the steep side.  The empanada appetizer was $10 and the pulled pork was $25.  Including sangria, tax, and tip, it was about $60 for my whole meal.  I definitely left full and the service we got was excellent, but still pricey.\n\nI know for a fact they participate in Restaurant Week and usually charge about $30 for a three course menu (including drink), so if you're looking to save a few bucks and take this place for a test drive, that would be a good time to try.

He castigated me for using a public forum. However, that is the purpose of Yelp. I have posted both excellent and poor reviews.\n I feel he preferred privacy because his message was not only poorly written and full of misspellings - he was nasty and unprofessional to the point of being abusive. After scanning the 44 filtered reviews, it is clear that others have had similar experiences with this guy.  He has been reported to Yelp corporate. The length of it prevented me from cut/pasting it here. In the interest of full disclosure: I did not realize at the time the steak was comped and mailed an additional $10 tip to our server a few days later - but the owner thinks WE should be embarrassed???? - yet he admitted that steak was in a puddle of maple syrup. I have been \"ordered\" not to step foot in any of this guys establishments. No problem. i certainly would not even feel safe in doing so!!! The owner states he was upset that we left upset. We didn't - we smiled and thanked all. He wasnt \"upset\" - it was a temper tantrum. He states he is not \"obligated to smile and suck up to\" us. I did apologize at my tendency to give \"tips\". I used to teach Culinary Arts, and including tips was habit, but at the same time presumptuous of me. This owner also blathered his team's affiliation with the owner of the Barrio Cafe, Silvana Esparza - who we know (although he did not know her first OR last name correctly). Because of his demeanor, I thought she should know her name was being used by this individual and the entire unedited communication has already been sent to her via email.\nFurther, a \"new\" Yelp member (0 reviews/comments) has accessed my messages [after I blocked the owner] and continued the rant......thinking I would not recognize the familiar syntax and complete lack of punctuation. \nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nI notice the ratings here are either very good.....or very bad. That was our experience here - massive inconsistency.\nWe had been wanting to come here for some time and took advantage of one of the local deals. The patio is lovely and our greeting was friendly. \nThe mango mojito was the best I've had since Puerto Rico and the Salmon Crouquettes were delicious - flavorful and just the right crispness and spice. \nOur dinners were more than disappointing. My husband's steak - ordered medium rare - arrived well done and chewy/tough. I can't remember when we sent something back....it's been years. But we spoke to the waiter and he took it back. That meant we both ate from my dinner - an evening special of blackened Mahi Mahi. I've had Mahi blackend many times, and this wasn't discernible as being blackened or flavorful at all. For one thing, I've never seen blackened fish with the skin left on. The Mahi \"steak\" is a firm fish - supposed to be rubbed with spice on both sides and seared quickly at a high temp.  The creamed corn was watery and bland. (Use heavy cream - not milk...and thicken). \nMy husband's 2nd steak arrived nearly raw and swimming in a 1/4 inch puddle of maple syrup. The syrup was no doubt spooned over the maple-chipotle carrots at the other end of the large plate, Come ON!! The idea is to GLAZE the carrots. Drizzle the syrup over the carrots and shove that plate under the salamander to carmelize. \nEeeeeyuk - especially since the steak was smothered in onions, peppers, etc. \nMy husband ate a few bites from the outer edges. The cheddar chipotle mashed potatoes were the best item on either one of our plates, but only the top of the potatoes could be sampled, as they had also sponged up the maple syrup.\nOur waiter was very good - professional and friendly. He was very apologetic about the steak and I always feel sorry when the waitstaff has to take complaints back to the kitchen (I've been in that situation).  My husband, an excellent grill master, remarked that whoever was on their grill just was not confidant at judging the \"doneness\" of the meat. From the look on our waiter's face, it appeared that he already knew  this. Steak is simple and if their grill manager isn't confidant.....use a thermometer.\nWe passed on dessert, and because of the special (an Amazon Local) - our bill wasn't painful. Had there been no discount on the bill, we probably would have asked that my husband's meal be refunded and ordered another round of the salmon crouquettes. \nAll in all, this felt like a place that just opened and doesn't have their act together and hasn't bothered to clean up the \"details.\"  - like the type-written drink menu that says their  house Margarita contains rum. (Huh??) How hard is that to fix? And their bartender - who knows nothing about tequila.  And why was their restaurant sign tilted up against the wall and not out front at 6:00 on a Saturday?\nThis experience was like one of those TV shows where someone needs to go in and decorate, organize, and teach.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 10, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Love love love this place!

All worth it though and we wouldn't have tried all the dif. things if we limited ourselves!  Seeing as how my friend is Salvadoran, I knew her approval was the icing on the cake.\n\nWe ordered the following:\n1) Chicharron con queso pupusa con harina de arroz.\nThe dough of this pork pupusa was made from a rice instead.  It was a little firmer texture than the standard pupusa.  Pretty good. I prefer it softer but still yummy\n\n2) Calabaza con queso pupusa\nShredded zucchini and cheese. Couldn't really taste the zucchini as it was vey mild but good for those of you who want green veggies :). \n\n3) tamale de pollo - my favorite!!! Salvadoran tamales aren't like Mexican tamales. The masa is much softer, moister and smoother (not as grainy). It came with meat and a small piece of potato.  Not sure how much they cost here but back home I've paid $3-$5 for them and this one was certainly the best one. The masa was so well flavored and at $1.80 ea, it is well worth it. \n\n4) Camarones de mojo al ajo-garlic shrimp\nDefinitely garlicky. You get a small bowl of shrimp in garlic sauce with 2 plain pupusas, beans, rice and salad.  The shrimp was a bit too firm for our liking.  But the sauce was good.\n\n5) Horchata Salvadorena\nThis horchata is made from a seed called moro instead of using rice.  It was nuttier and almost smoky tasting.  It wasn't sweet at all but apparently it can sometimes be.  My friend gave it a thumbs up.  I thought it was a good change from the Mexican horchata but it's not for everyone.  The waitress was really sweet and let us try a sample first. \n\n6) Nuegados de yuca - friend yuca with sweet custard inside.  At this point I am hitting my limit of being overly stuffed with carbs.  Heck, I don't even know if I got the spanish name right b/c I am so full.  It wasn't as \"custardy\" as my friend is used to.  It was a bit firmer but you can't beat fried yuca with something sweet inside.  It wasn't overly sweet.\n\n7) Empanadas de platano (?) dessert - it was fried plantain with something inside I think and with a brown syrup to dip.  \n\nAs the first one to review this place, I say go go go to this great little place.  They have specials on pupusas on Weds and Sats.  \nIf you're driving and you're going west on Indian School, there is a good chance you might drive by it.

The salsa is so good and has a really nice kick of spicy that I love. The drinks are super strong, I ordered a Long Island Iced Tea, which I like because I don't drink often (in fact the last time I drank was the last time I was at Fuego Tacos) but when I do drink I want to feel buzzed and these drinks will get you there about halfway through one drink. Either that or I am a super lightweight. The specialty drinks on the menu are $5, but I guess custom drink orders not on the menu are a bit more because my Long Island was $7. Beer I think is $4. \n\nI ordered the spicy vegetable tacos again but this time with soft shells, and they were much better. I didn't even finish them this time because I was so full. I also got a full plate of black beans again. They make me happy. My husband got the shrimp tacos and he liked them much better than the fish tacos he got last time.

The food there is over the top and amazing.........but what stood out to me is the owner came running to our table after we ordered a bottle of wine off the menu and offered us something not on the menu for the same price.  He insisted that he would personally drink it if we did not like it.....we LOVED it, and his passion for his food!  With that and a few more amazing experiences at the Bistro, I was stoked when I saw the Tacos concept pop up.  Again Groupon pulled through with a crazy deal and I had to try it.  Most of the slow-braised meats from the Bistro have migrated over and make amazing tacos that are extremely well proportioned with rice and beans included for about $10, you cannot beat this deal!  \n\nThe wine list at Fuego Tacos follows the same formula as the Bistro with a focus in S. America and always an interesting Malbec! The beer selection is good and the service has been spot on every time I have gone.  My only critic is that the salsa has been inconsistent from my first visit.  Some days are better than others, but being a frequent visitor it is evident they are tweaking the recipe (I personally would vote for a spicier red traditional salsa as well as an optional charred salsa to compliment the slow cooked meats).  \n\nI have been fortunate to watch this place grow up over the month and with each visit it is obvious that the owner listens and fixes.

Fuego, I love everything you do.\n\nMy journey with Fuego began at last year's taco festival in October. Their offerings were so moist and juicy that I knew I was going to be a repeat customer. Then, much to my dismay. Fuego Tacos did not open until January 2011. I had to content myself with its delicious but pricer older sister, Fuego Bistro (where I would dine every day if I could afford it).\n\nFinally, fast forward a few more months and I got to try the amazingness that is Fuego Tacos again and my palate sang with delight.\n\nSo, enough with story time.

They also have the same legendary mojitos as Fuego Bistro in about a billionty tongue-pleasing flavors. Alright, it's more like thirty, but it is still a lot.\n\nThe server will bring complimentary homemade chips and salsa to your table. The taco plates come with two tacos, rice, and beans with a price tag ranging from $9 to $12. But, on Mondays and Tuesdays, taco plates are half off if you buy a drink so have a mojito too. If you go during happy hour (3-7pm), drink prices are $3-$4. So, you can score both for less than the price of a normal taco plate. Win-Win. \n\nThe spicy margarita made with jalape\u00f1o-infused tequila that is made of the devil's spittle, I assure you. It is rimmed with crack-tastic cumin salt. However, it is not a drink for the timid as a few sips from my date's drink and I felt like I gained a half dozen ulcers. I love spicy, so this is a dangerous combination. Stomach lining won over palate in this case.\n\nIn my experience, service at Fuego restaurants is always friendly and attentive without smothering you. I found this to be the case at Fuego Tacos as well. We received attention from both our server and the bartender. They wanted to make sure that we were taken care of and that we were happy with our selections.

Because of the printer it was hard to tell if it expired today or the 28th..but, regardless with the economy the way it is and restaurants sitting empty...Fuego Tacos should have opened their arms to these 6 hungry paying customers.The coupon was only for $10.00...with all of us wanting to drink Margarita's and have appetizers and then some tacos. Tacos are $3.00 each we would of had 2 each, plus at least one if not two Margaritas per person at $5.00 each, plus some guacamole at $4.00. Let's do the math: 6 people eating 12 tacos = $36.00 + drinking 6 to 12 Margarita's =$30.00 to $60.00 and 2 orders of Guac = $8.00 . Total $104.00!! w/o tax and tip. Plus also..some of the people wanted to buy a full size lunch and not Tacos...so add in another $30.00. So basically, because of your uneducated management style and practices... FUEGO TACOS lost more than $150.00 plus tax and tip for lunch on a party of 6!..not too mention the whole...one person scorned will tell at least 20 people x 6 = 120 ( which is a low estimate considering the internet and facebook) people will now, know how cheap and stupid Fuego Tacos are...no matter how good your tacos might have been.

Best bet is to park in the parking garage and then go to the walking mall.  Even so, it's tough to find.  Don't give up.  Also, it is no longer Fuego Tacos, but now Fuego del Mar, with a seafood-centric menu.  \n\nThat being said.  I was pretty edgy by the time we arrived.  We're from Cave Creek and had been out shopping and then had a heck of a time finding the place, so we arrived about 8.15---pretty close to closing.  And I had a Groupon---and there are Yelp reviews that said the staff DOESN'T like Groupon-ers.\n\nGreeted by guy that I assume is the gent someone described as \"XL\".  He's just a little round.  And was a warm, welcoming fella.  He beamed a smile at us, waved at dining room and told us to sit wherever we wanted.  We chose a cozy booth in the corner.  Our server was there in moments with menus and take our drink orders.  I wish I remembered her name---dark hair in a pony-tail, glasses, and really personable and nice despite it being the end of the night and we were late-comers.  \n\nNice ambiance---exposed brick walls, soft light, great music---DH would have liked their playlist!\n\nTROUBLE: she hands us the menu.  Except for one dish, everything is seafood.  Fuego Tacos is now Fuego del Mar.  DH doesn't like fish and is semi-allergic to shellfish.  I asked if he wanted to leave, and he said no, we had gone thru too much to find the place---he would just order the one non-seafood dish.  At least he didn't have to make a lot of choices!  So DH ordered the Pernil Asada, which was described as slow-cooked pork topped with mango-chile salsa.  His sides were the Green Chile-Bacon Hushpuppies and the Latin Succotash.  I ordered their signature dish of Seafood Chile Rellenos---a poblano pepper stuffed with shrimp, crab and tilapia in a lobster-tomato sauce with hush puppies and Pineapple-Serrano Cole Slaw.  For drinks, DH got the house red and I got a Pomegranate Adult Lemonade.\n\nDrinks arrived in less than 5 minutes.  DH very happy with something he thought would be bottom row plonk.  My Adult Lemonade was SO delicious---I had to be careful!  I could have drank several of them.  It tasted like lemonade with a hint of fruit---but it definitely had alcohol in it!\n\nEntrees arrived within 15 minutes of the drinks.  DH's was all on one plate.  Three hush puppies, Latin Succotash---which looked delish---and a mound of pork with the salsa.  Not super pretty.  My presentation was much more beautiful---a mammoth poblano pepper in a puddle of light red sauce.  Slaw and hush puppies on the side.  Lovely presentation.  My only comment is that serving something in a bowl (albeit large) that needs to be cut is problematic.\n\nI'd like to say how wonderful DH's meal was, but basically I got one bite of his pork---that's all he would share---before he devoured it.  He said it was one of the best pork dishes he had ever enjoyed.  He felt like he was in the Caribbean!  I got no bites of the Succotash, darn him---looked so good!  He scarfed it all!   His hush puppies went that fast too!\n\nWas my seafood Chile Relleno the best thing EVER?  No, but it was VERY, VERY GOOD!  Beautifully cooked, not greasy,  seafood not overcooked at all, the lobster-tomato sauce was delicious.  Again, only quibble I have is serving it in a bowl.  It was a very deep bowl too---a smaller girl might have had trouble reaching in there, but I am fairly tall and long-armed.  The hush puppies---shut my mouth, darlin', but they were dang good!  Lots of lovely, bacon-y flavor, a hint of heat, and a touch sweet.  What is it with those Yankees not adding a bit of sweet to their cornbread?  Whoever made these knew what they were doing.  The Pineapple-Serrano Cole Slaw was in a citrus-y, non-creamy dressing and the crispness, the fruitiness and the heat was a perfect counterpoint to the richness of the Relleno.\n\nHuge portion---I ended up bringing home half the Relleno, Slaw and two hush puppies---LUNCH!  YUM!  DH swined his plate so it's deli turkey for him, hahaha!\n\nBonus---ended up talking to the gentleman in the booth next to us---so interesting.  He is a musician who's lived all over the US and the world---Europe and the Middle East.  Really neat guy.  I wouldn't live in the City, but I love visiting the City 'cause you meet the most interesting people!\n\nSo at the end, I pulled out my Groupon and gave it to our server, apologizing that I had \"hid\" it until the end, but that Yelp reviews had indicated Groupon-ers got short shift as far as service went.

Unfortunately she was the only waitress and doubled as the bartender, but she did hustle and do their best.  Our first problem?  People will think we are harsh, but the person who sat us (the only other person in the restaurant) seemed to have a hearing impairment.  He said nothing to us, didn't welcome us and when we asked a question, he ignored us.  I know - he's deaf (or partially) but why would you put such a person at the front door?  It took us at least 20 minutes to figure out why he was \"so rude\" to us.\n\nWe ordered (supposedly) the two best items on the menu.  The pasta and the enchiladas del mar.  The pasta was watery and spicy.  The del mar was unremarkable with overcooked rubbery seafood.   I love seafood and I love Mexican seafood, but they have nothing but seafood on the menu.  If you want meat or chicken you are SOL.  The drinks were good.  Service took a while since poor Amanda was just about everything rolled into one.  We think it would have been better for hearing impaired guy to be running the bar (and bussing) and having Amanda be waitress and hostess.  Just our opinion.\n\nThe other problem is the location in the Esplanade.  This is just an odd place for business.  It has an annoying \"pay-only\" garage, within a dead area, with no vibrant shops.  Getting in and out isn't easy either.   We remember way back when, when McCormack and Schmidt was a bustling restaurant here.  It just seems that nothing succeeds in the Esplanade across from those Biltmore shops.  Even the pedestrian walkway didn't help.  How many people were killed leaving the Esplanade and running across the street to the Biltmore?  That ought to be an indicator.   We don't know why or how things fail in the Esplanade it's just one of those things.  It's like the old Galleria Mall failing directly across the street from The Fashion Square. \n\nIt was a $90 bill, minus the $30 Groupon, plus tip.  Was it worth it?  We don't think so.  Would we go again?  No.  There's better Mexican food in the valley, closer and a lot cheaper.  We don't think this place will last long.  Its seems everyone in there had a Groupon or an Amazon local coupon.  They actually had a sign at the door explaining the rules.  That to me that points to a problem when the only reason people will visit your joint is with a coupon.\n\nAnd the best part?   When we go to restaurants we usually will \"check in\" on Yelp.

It was cooked perfectly and the crispiness of the batter was in a perfect relationship with the softness and flavors of the pepper and seafood.  Also the seafood was cooked to perfection, which is very rare for Arizona.  I had the mac and cheese and hush puppies for my sides which were also delectable.  My gf had the enchiladas which she also thought were marvelous , I got to eat her second one, the next day and she was right.

This resolve quickly crumbled once I began to sample the Del Mar Empanadas at Fuego Del Mar. \n\nI've eaten my fair share of empanadas in my lifetime. These are a staple in any South American kitchen. (My Mom makes *amazing* empanadas.) They can be baked or fried. Fried ones are generally, in my opinion, the better variety.\n\nAt Del Mar the empanadas are stuffed with crab meat, chorizo, goat cheese (yes!)  and white corn. If that wasn't enough goodness, they are topped with a tomatillo verde sauce. I had agreed to \"just try\" the empanada as I wasn't prepared to sabotage myself.\n\nPfft! The empanadas are heavenly. I don't know quite how they time the cooking, but the chef managed to present a delightful culinary treat without a hint of grease. They were fried ... but there wasn't any goop. (For lack of a better word.) Seriously good stuff.\n\nMy dining companion and I had arrived at Fuego Del Mar after using Yelp. There was a $5 for $10 deal. What we missed in reading carefully, is that the menu displayed on the mobile app is for lunch pricing.  (Whoops!) Additionally, I was a bit bummed as I wasn't ravenous and the Happy Hour menu (which is available \"all day\") may not be combined with any other offers. At that point we almost decided to sit separately at the bar after speaking with the server. (There seemed to be some confusion that the Yelp offer is still online.)\n\nI'd checkout downstairs seating. Upstairs offers a beautiful view of the bar. However, service turn around can be limited.

NOT SURE WHY THEY HAVE TWO PROFILES BUT LOOK AT THE BOTH.  WE POSTED THIS SAME REVIEW THERE TOO.\n\nWe love to try new restaurants and this one popped up with a Groupon offer for $30, so we thought we would give it a shot.\n\nIt was very disappointing.  The only reason why we gave this some stars was because our waitress Amanda was funny and inviting.  Unfortunately she was the only waitress and doubled as the bartender, but she did hustle and do their best.  Our first problem?  People will think we are harsh, but the person who sat us (the only other person in the restaurant) seemed to have a hearing impairment.  He said nothing to us, didn't welcome us and when we asked a question, he ignored us.  I know - he's deaf (or partially) but why would you put such a person at the front door?  It took us at least 20 minutes to figure out why he was \"so rude\" to us.\n\nWe ordered (supposedly) the two best items on the menu.  The pasta and the enchiladas del mar.  The pasta was watery and spicy.  The del mar was unremarkable with overcooked rubbery seafood.   I love seafood and I love Mexican seafood, but they have nothing but seafood on the menu.  If you want meat or chicken you are SOL.  The drinks were good.  Service took a while since poor Amanda was just about everything rolled into one.  We think it would have been better for hearing impaired guy to be running the bar (and bussing) and having Amanda be waitress and hostess.  Just our opinion.\n\nThe other problem is the location in the Esplanade.  This is just an odd place for business.  It has an annoying \"pay-only\" garage, within a dead area, with no vibrant shops.  Getting in and out isn't easy either.   We remember way back when, when McCormack and Schmidt was a bustling restaurant here.  It just seems that nothing succeeds in the Esplanade across from those Biltmore shops.  Even the pedestrian walkway didn't help.  How many people were killed leaving the Esplanade and running across the street to the Biltmore?  That ought to be an indicator.   We don't know why or how things fail in the Esplanade it's just one of those things.  It's like the old Galleria Mall failing directly across the street from The Fashion Square. \n\nIt was a $90 bill, minus the $30 Groupon, plus tip.  Was it worth it?  We don't think so.  Would we go again?  No.  There's better Mexican food in the valley, closer and a lot cheaper.  We don't think this place will last long.  Its seems everyone in there had a Groupon or an Amazon local coupon.  They actually had a sign at the door explaining the rules.  That to me that points to a problem when the only reason people will visit your joint is with a coupon.\n\nAnd the best part?   When we go to restaurants we usually will \"check in\" on Yelp.

Let us explain and show you how social media works.  \n\nJeff & Amanda Ward:  We never mentioned anyone's name (so now we are) and our intent wasn't to shame \"Chritopher\" (funny how if you say that out loud, it's EXACTLY how a deaf person would say it...CHRI...TO...PHER!), and you're the one who brought up his name.  We gave nothing but praise to Amanda for her hard work and trying to make the best of a bad situation and restaurant.  So Jeff Ward calls us an A-hole because we gave him a crappy review??? We weren't saying Chris was a bad person, we were saying that it was sheer ineptitude on your part to put such a person as your host and greeter as your host.   Was I supposed to know sign language? How do you expect your customers to communicate with a host?  Pen and paper?  Your greeter and host is the one who markets the food and introduces the outside world to your doorway, but after reading your post to customers it's clear that you are too obtuse to realize this. \n\nWe made the suggestion that rather than having Amanda be busser, bartender and waitress, why not have her be host and waitress and have Chris be bartender and busser?  It makes sense but I guess you didn't learn that in day trader school, did you Jeff?\n\nYour other commentary just shows what a douchebag your truly are, Jeff.   Beyond deciding on Marlee Matlan being your host, your food sucks.  I mean really sucks.  It's unremarkable. Your supposed best items were mediocre.  It's not even Mexican food. You should call it Fuego Del Mierda.  In a city and a state that was owned by Mexico for 1000s of years, and with tons of competition with Hispanic foods, one would think you and Amanda would develop a remarkable and different concept.  My suggestion is to hire someone in the restaurant industry that has a last name with a few vowels and ends with the letter \"Z\"   It's surprising that your wife Amanda is the only one working with the deaf guy.

Did you go back to day trading because you can't hack it in the restaurant business?\n\nI feel sorry that your chose a bad location and have a shitty restaurant. (but not really -again highlighting your ineptitude and ignorance)  All you had to do was ask anyone homeless dude in Phoenix and they would have shared what a disaster the Esplanade is.  Are there any shops left there?  Oh yeah - just your little crappy joint.

We walked in and were greeted by a strange, musty smell that remained pervasive throughout the meal.  We should have taken that as an indication of what was to come and left, but based on the great reviews, decided to stay.  Big mistake.\n\nI ordered a red sangria which was okay, but had a strange flavor of figs or dates so I'm not sure if it was just made with old wine that had turned and took on a prune juice flavor or if that taste was intentional.  We ordered the olives, fried potatoes, grilled zucchini, shisito peppers, and four different types of bruschetta.  The olives were, well, olives (tough to ruin those) but also contained some off-putting caperberries that we avoided.  The grilled zucchini was just plain zucchini with no seasoning whatsoever served with a side of what looked like potato salad as a dip, but we never really could identify what that substance was as it had absolutely no flavor so we opted to avoid the fat that it was obviously adding to the zucchini.  The shisito peppers had no spice or flavor at all and were absolutely swimming in oil.  I've never had a \"roasted\" pepper that was so soaked in grease.  The waitress asked if we didn't like the peppers when she noticed that all but a few remained and when we pointed out how greasy they were, politely took them off the bill.  The four pieces of bruschetta were all of different varieties: roasted eggplant; ripe tomatoes; avocado and beans; and grilled artichoke with cheese.  The bread was thick and chewy and none of the bruschettas had much flavor at all.  In fact, I think if I had just closed my eyes and randomly selected one off the plate, I probably wouldn't have been able to tell which it was.  The fried potato wedges were actually the best part of the meal, which is sad when the best item is a simple fried potato.\n\nThe atmosphere was severely lacking as there were candles on all of the tables and numerous votives on the walls, but not a single one was lit.  The restroom was extremely dark and was absolutely filled with unlit votive candles so I'm not sure if this was an attempt at saving costs, but had I known this, I would have gladly spared a box of votives from home just to create some sort of ambiance while we ate.  The place is also incredibly tiny so I have no idea where the flamenco band and dancers that other reviews have spoken of would perform.  If anyone tried to move through there, they would literally be bumping into tables.  \n\nWhile I love tapas style dining, if this were the only tapas restaurant that there was, I would gladly forego the experience.

The tortilla strips and melted queso fresco inside added a nice touch. The shredded beef was marinated in interesting flavors (something beer/alcohol-based I believe) and made for a good light taco meal. The prices were fair, with entrees coming in around $10 and individual tacos at $2 each. The soup was very good, but at $6, it feels a little overpriced. Overall, it was a good experience and a tasty meal. They even gave me a tea refill to go afterwards. I would like to visit again.\n\nI am concerned about the service, however. While the two people there were friendly and working hard, it was a tad bit slow with only a few tables occupied. Since it appears that the only staff is a mother/daughter team, there is no way they could adequately serve this place if it were half or more filled.

Their website mentions sandwiches, but I don't recall seeing any listed in their one-page menu...  I chose (from left to right) Cilantro hummus- awesome flavors, and one of my favorites of the four; Red pepper hummus- didn't impress me, but I've had a sensitivity to red bell peppers over the past few years, but Mom loved this one (!); Smoked salmon (with egg salad El Diablo and capers, and diced cucumbers as well, for those who are allergic to cukes)... this was another one I liked; and Chicken salad (with raspberry mayo and dried cranberries)- took me a couple of bites transitioning from the smoked salmon for me to enjoy this one.  I liked the textural differences from the soft mouth-feel of smoked salmon and egg salad to the chunky grilled chicken cubes and chewy dried cranberries.

I somehow missed the fountain on my way to the restaurant (we came in separate cars), and I was on my way home when I spotted it across the street, so I parked at the shopping complex and went for a stroll.

Park St.  The building looks like it may have been an old diner at one point - I think it's because of the Inka Heritage \"Pepsi\" sign on the building.  However, the interior of the restaurant looks nothing like a diner.  It has the look and feel of a new restaurant with bright mango/orange colored walls, a few paintings and Incan art.\n\nAPPETIZER\nCeviche - sea bass cut into small chunks marinated in lemon/lime juice and chilies and toped with slivered red onions.  It also came with a thick slice of yam or sweet potato and some hominy (really big corn kernels).  They asked if we wanted hot or mild and we said HOT!  It was incredibly delicious!\n\nDINNER\nLomito Saltado - tender pieces of steak strips sauted with onions, tomatoes, french fries, soy/peruvian sauce and served with rice.  This is a dish we get all the time and it was the best here (although, it could have used a bit more sauce).\n\nPescado a lo Macho - fillet of sea bass lightly battered and fried (but very lightly) served with a white wine sauce along with more seafood - calamari, shrimp, mussels and a piece of king crab.  The taste of this dish was amazing!  The fish was cooked perfectly and flaked off nicely.  I didn't even need to eat the rice it comes with because there was enough seafood to fill me up.\n\nDESSERT\nAlfajores - delicious tender and thin shortbread sandwich cookies filled with dulce de leche (caramel condensed milk) covered with lots of powdered sugar and served with a few drizzles of chocolate sauce and fresh whip cream around the plate.

I used to dine at this location quite frequently as a freshman when it was a hole in the wall Chinese restaurant, so I was amazed at how the interior was turned around.

The lamb was so succulent, each bite so rich and hearty my mouth watered for more.  The seafood dish (which was recommended) was done to perfection--shrimp plump and juicy, King Crab legs already cut.  My favorite was the chicken dish which had an interesting cheese crumb outside layer.  The sides made out from corn were rich in flavor.  \n\nOverall this was quite an interesting dining experience.

I can't vouch for the authenticity coz I am no Peruvian, but it was darn good. For entrees, I had the Lomo Saltado (excellent, 4.5 stars for being a little stingy with the sauce). The wife had Seco de Cordero (very tasty sauce, nice sides, 4.5 stars coz the lamb could have been a little more tender).

The fish ceviche was tilapia and the seafood included fish, shrimp, mussels, and squid.  The other seafood didn't excite me as much (if octopus was part of the seafood ceviche, then I would've gone for it), so we ordered the fish.  The waiter asked if we wanted it spicy which we did.  It came out very flavorful and well saturated in citrusy goodness.  I liked it but I would've liked a bit less lime.  I didn't feel like I got to taste much else but a spicy lime sauce.  The yams or pumpkin or whatever that came with it was soft and deliciously sweet and served as a great contrast to the ceviche, but I would've liked more of it.  \n\nMy dish wasn't quite what I had expected.  I tend to think of arroz on pollo as a more chicken and rice cooked together kind of dish, but what do I know?  This was rice served with a grilled chicken, but it was a delicious green rice and grilled chicken.  The chicken was very tender and well cooked.  The rice was well flavored and the two complemented each other very well.  The presentation was also very exciting.  The dish also came with a green cilantro sauce that I poured over my rice.  It totally changed the flavor of the dish and definitely made for an exciting dining experience.   \n\nI found it reasonably priced.

I had heard tons of good things about the place and was so excited to finally hop a bus to South Park so I could go try it. I left Inka so upset, so dissatisfied that I couldn't even calm down enough to write this review for a long while. In short, I undoubtedly received the worst service that I have ever had in my entire life. I never really knew how important the organizational aspects of a restaurant could be until I learned what it was like to dine at a place that was completely and utterly devoid of it. McDonald's offers a more personable dining experience than this.\n\nMy whole visit to Inka Heritage was miserable from the minute I walked in the door. Upon doing so, I watched from across an empty hostess' podium as at least 5 different people darted in and out of the kitchen. Not one couldn't be bothered to take a minute to seat any of the 10 people waiting awkwardly by the door for any of the 10+ open seats. Once I finally was acknowledged about 15 minutes later, the waiter proceeded to argue with me, telling me that my name wasn't on the list and that the reservation I had made was no good. \n\nAfter being seated and ignored for another 20 minutes, the same waiter came out to quickly get our drink and food orders with as little formality as possible. I started to envy the 3+ parties that had walked out due to the restaurant's negligence. \n\nTurns out that at 1:00 on a Wednesday, they had already run out of the main ingredients for four of the nine dishes on their restaurant week menu. I attempted to order an Inka Cola and found out they were out of that too. I ordered a Chica Morada in its place, a sweet corn-based drink which was actually really good; it tasted like a fruity horchata. Unfortunately, it ended up being the only truly good thing I had here.\n\nMy disastrous first course was supposed to be fried yuccas with a savory yellow sauce and half a boiled egg. But the yuccas had been replaced with cold, unseasoned, boiled potato slices. The sauce and egg had no hope of making up for the nastiness of the potato, which overwhelmed the dish. I felt like I was eating at the cafeteria in a retirement home. The yuccas were supposed to be the star ingredient of that dish, and the chefs did absolutely nothing to compensate for the fact that they were missing. It was so bad, they should have been too ashamed to even consider serving it. \n\nOf the three possible first courses, this one was godawful, the other one was \"completely sold out,\" and the last was a salad that was lacking in any flavor. It did have an interesting twist via the large, hard pieces of Peruvian corn that it contained.\n\nMy second course was decent, but tasted like something I could easily make at home. The beef stew was well-cooked, as was the cube of rice that came with it. Sitting next to them was another pile of those flavorless, disgusting potatoes. As I ate my way through it, I couldn't help but ask myself what exactly is Peruvian about 4 cubes of beef with plain potatoes and rice. This dish was a tradition in my household as well. We called it \"leftovers night.\"\n\nI finally ended this painful experience with a tres leches pound cake. It apparently was trying to be sweet and savory, but ended up being moreso on the \"bland lumpy mash\" side.

We had been looking for a good place to eat in Madison and this came up on Yelp.  I can honestly say that I have never had Peruvian food before and so I was looking forward to eating here.  Upon entering the restaurant the first thing that I noticed was how bright the walls were as they were a bright golden/orange color.  Other than the walls there were a bunch of white table clothed tables around including a few high tops.\n\nMy fiance and I decided to start off our evening with the ceviche which consisted of raw fish, leche de tigre (lime juice, garlic and ginger), sweet potatoes and peruvian corn (think American corn only much larger kernals) .  While I have had ceviche before, it has generally been at trendier places and so the focus has been smaller dishes catering to foodies and  not necessarily on portion size.  So you can imagine my surprise whenever the ceviche came out and it was a huge plate covered in fish and peruvian corn.  Both my fiance and I loved every minute of eating it as the leche de tigre had a perfectly acidity that complimented the fished perfectly.  For my dinner entree I ended up ordering the Pollo naeza which was actually not what I had decided on.  It was a Peruvian seasoned chicken filet with a inka salad and white rice.  You see I had closed the menu and whenever I picked it had said the wrong dish insted of the aji de hallina which was chicken in a Peruvian cream sauce.  After our server had left our entrees at our table I questioned my fiance about whether it was what I had ordered and she said that she had been surprised by it but yes it was.  I was a little disappointed as it was not what I was looking forward to but since I had ordered it I decided to stick with it  The chicken breast was juicy as they had said it would be although I didn't get too much of the spice and the salad was decent as well.

I have very little experience with traditional Peruvian food--for one thing, the last time I was in Peru was in the early 1980's and I was definitely traveling on a budget, so I did not have the chance to eat high end Peruvian food, and I was only there a few days as a lay over en route back from Bolivia.  I loved the Quechua and Aymara Indian women in their traditional dress, as well as their gorgeous native weavings from alpaca--and the fact that for both of us Spanish was a second language.\n\nBut the food did not strike me as amazing--I ate a lot of rehydrated purple potatoes is what I recall.\nThe thing that I love about Peruvian food, besides the ceviche (which is excellent and also a large portion for the price at Inka Heritage), is the causas.  What is a causa?  Is it versatile Peruvian potato dish makes a great light meal or a fine appetizer to share with the table. A causa can be layered with any number of fillings -- chicken salad and tuna salad are favorites, and both are available at Inka Heritage. Vegetarian fillings are options as well. They are served cold, which takes some getting used to because they are nothing like potato salad.  A causa rellena is often topped with extravagant garnishes and sauces for a colorful presentation.\n\nThe other thing that is quite well represented at this restaurant are rice and seafood dishes (they have chicken and meat options as well)--these are either sauce based, or they are like paella, but with much different flavors to the rice.\n\n\nThis was not a fancy restaurant, but it was very nice, and the prices were reasonable.

During the meal, he checked in on my periodically, promptly removed the dirty dishes and took the picture I needed for participating in the Taste Race.

It was a well-balanced dish, chock full of veggies and tender white meat.  \n\nThe soup was a just a prelude to an appetizing main course.  I ordered the house specialty, the pollo a la brasa.  The roasted chicken was moist on the inside, with a crispy, slightly salty skin.  Again, the kitchen applied the seasoning with a deft hand for this dish. The zesty cilantro sauce served with the dish was a perfect complement.

The cilantro sauce is super flavorful. The pescado a la chorillana was lightly fried fish served with white rice and a red semi spicy sauce. There were sauteed onions and carrots.

Now it's hard to do better then Rick Bayless, but Inka did good. Not dangerously spicy, mostly all seafood rather then having a equal amount of fillers to deceive your eyes.

I just said \"sure, yeah\" thinking that they where afraid to cook meat that way and just hoping that I wasn't about to receive a dog toy of a meat. But I was happily surprised when I received the dished that the beef was not rubber. Was unevenly cooked thou with parts being rare and others being medium rare. After rereading the menu online I saw that the dish was also to have a creole sauce that wasn't present but wasn't needed with the liquid gold of a yoke from the egg.

My only disappointment was in the codfish arepa - salty, fishy, and an added upset to the booze I just ingested. \n\nThe best part about this place, other than the arepas? The price! I swear, for under five bucks per arepa, I am not conscious of my broke college finances.

WAY better than the ones I had in Venezuela (they hate Americans down there, so they probably pissed in my arepa at that bus depot).

For those of you who aren't familiar with Arepas, they're pretty much small, fried cornmeal pockets stuffed with meats, cheese, veggies, sauce, etc, etc. Viva also makes empanadas, a few hot dogs, aguas frescas, and a few sweet treats like flan and more. They also have these two amazing shack-made sauces. One is a lime green color that's mild but has an amazing flavor and the other is a spicy red sauce. Since my wife and I were going to have a big dinner the same day we visited Viva, we decided to just get a few items to try. This is what we purchased;\n\nLengua Arepa W/ White Cheese & Avocado Slices http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=8lN2NE_nQzG-VFNGfeR1hA\nGround Beef & Shredded Cheese Arepa  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=-dY7b8L5QpT1MPtSHG34ug\nBlack Bean & Cheese Empanada http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=D_dkKgnCHti4moXUxO85vQ\n\nAll three items were incredibly delicious. The cornmeal pockets were perfectly fried yet still had a soft center. The Lengua, which was shredded and cooked in a delicious sauce, was my fave of the two. It was savory, sweet and slightly spicy all at the same time. The ground beef Arepa reminded me of a Taco Bell Chalupa, but obviously much better. The black bean and cheese empanada was also very good. \n\nTo wash down our yummy snacks we had a large Passion Fruit aguas frescas. It was super sweet and super refreshing. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=Wz0vow2OgM5E5N6lMQP07Q \n\nThe prices for each Arepa are about $3 or $4 bucks a piece, which isn't too bad considering how delicious they are. The guys who were working in the shack were all friendly and got our food out to us quickly. \n\nIf you're in LV and feel like something quick, tasty and cheap, don't go to some crappy chain place like McDonald's, head on down to Viva Las Arepas and treat yourself to some phenomenal Arepas.

Seriously its a shack, you cant miss it cuz it sticks out!!!  They have some tables set outside so there are places to for you to eat there.  Saw a few that just swung by and got it to go.   \n\nAn Arepa is a flat, round and soft patty made out of cornmeal, which is grilled, making it crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and then it can be stuffed with beef, chicken, ham, cheese, beans, shrimp, and many more. These delights are gluten-free, and wheat-free.

I have heard of arepas but never actually had them. For those noobs like me, its a dish made of ground corn dough or cooked flour, very prominent in the cuisine of Colombia and Venezuela.

They answer all the questions you have and even make suggestions based on what you are leaning towards. They bring it out to you where you sit with two ketchup bottles. One has a light green colored kind of sauce and the other has a light reddish tint to it. Both have different spices to it but the reddish colored one has a little kick to it. Not overpowering, but definitely gives your food that extra oomph that keeps your mouth watering.\n\nAs for their location, they used to be half a block up the street in a little taco stand. They are now on the corner of Oakey and S Las Vegas Blvd, just kitty corner to 7/11. Look for the weird Indian statues because they are neighbors with an Indian antique store.  I guess with their recent popularity, they moved to this spacious building. They have plenty of tables and chairs so bring your friends. Plenty of room.\n\nThe only negative things I can see is that the parking is kind of limited. The old Indian statues take up several parking stalls and the stalls are small to begin with so be real careful in parking and backing up.

By the time you see the restaurant, you probably will need to make a roundabout just to be able to get into the parking lot.\n\nAnyway, I've only tried three things at this place: rib eye steak, pork butt arepas, and asada arepas. I know that it's strange that I go to an arapas place and ordered steak, but they had a special rib eye steak for $10.99 and I was craving for it (LOL). Even though the meat wasn't high quality, the fire grilling and seasoning brought out great flavor from the meat and their side dishes were delicious. \n\nFor the pork butt arepas, the meat was too salty for my taste. Also the corn shells/buns were too oily. The asada meat was alright also. \n\nSo what's my verdict? If you haven't tried arepas and want something different, I think you should come by and give it a try.

Nah, Viva Las Arepas!\n\nA couple of buddies told me about this place and how they have cheap yet satisfying food. My cousin and I took a trip on a Tuesday afternoon for some grub. The restaurant is located on the left when going north on Las Vegas Blvd on Wyoming. The place is quite clean and large with tables and booths.  \n\nThere are pictures of their food items posted all over the restaurant. Those helped with familiarizing myself with their food items but didn't help in the sense for me to choose what I wanted since they all looked so delicious! \n\nAfter reading Yelp reviews and getting a recommendation from the girl behind the counter, my cousin and I decided to get the Reina Pepiada. In between two warm cornbread slices, there was shredded chicken breast with avocado, mayo, cilantro and green peas. The consistency was almost like a chicken salad. I was a little thrown off with how warm the cornbread slices were and how cold the chicken concoction was. But I got past this in a hot minute and chowed down happily. \n\nWe were given a red bottle (spicy hot sauce) and a yellow bottle (mild hot sauce) to have with our arepas. A little sprinkle of some hot sauce (I like the spicy but the mild is good, too) with each bite is key to elevate flavors. And a side note, don't be fooled by the \"small\" size of the arepa. This little baby fills you up. I walked out of there overly stuffed. \n\nTo wash it all down, we each ordered a fruit juice. What's cool is that they let you try samples before you buy one. My cousin ordered the guava juice and I ordered the mango. I expected the juices to be a little thick, but they weren't. Very refreshing and not too sweet. Doesn't taste artificial. I think I will end up craving their mango juice during the hot Vegas summer months.\n\nIf you find a silly Asian girl chanting \"long live the arepa!\" here, that's me.

Where you have a pita bread pocket stuffed with delicious meat.  You have several fillings to choose from, all of which are only $5!.  They also include a bottle of garlic sauce and hot sauce which helps add to the flavor of this pocket of tastiness.\n\nAll I know is I'm coming back here this weekend.

Thanks to Angela H. for making him go away!!! \n\nOk with that being said, I can now move on to the real review.\n\nSo after the CMYE 51s game, a few of us were still feeling like fatties since baseball food is gross and unfulfilling. After a list of places (Tacos El Gordo, Triple 7, this other taco stand that Anthony M. mentioned which I forgot the name of), we decided on this place. Rolled in about 10 minutes before closing. The workers were not annoyed to see us right before closing. Props to them because I would be irritated seeing people strolling in right before closing. \n\nThe arepa I ordered was delish. It reminded me of a tamale but in sandwhich form. It was packed full of meat and vegetables. Definitely more meat to vegetable ratio, but still a good thing. The bread (or masa or whatever its made of) was flaky and buttery and the meat was tender and cooked just right. Came with a bottle of cilantro mayo sauce thing and some hot sauce. Both made the arepa even more tasty. I could have easily finished mine if it weren't for the beers I drank earlier. \n\nDefinitely a good lunch spot or late night dinner spot if you are in the area.

Good savory flavor but I personally like the shredded texture better - less meat falls out with each bite.\n-Reina pepiada arepa ($5): I normally dislike mayonnaise, but this is sooo good. The chicken+cilantro+flavors+avocado are like the best chicken salad you've ever had.\n-Cachapas ($5): Never had this before, we loved it! thick gooey cheese between SWEET corn pancake thingies. They weren't tortillas - more like thin cornmeal pancakes, and were sweet. Sweet and sorta salty from the cheese. So.

Others were more soft, but ended up becoming soggy and tasting like a mushy corn texture. \n\nReina pepiada: 4 stars. It is an avocado chicken salad. It was yummy although missing some texture.\n\nGarlic shrimp: 2 stars. This was my least favorite by far. The arepa for this one seemed very corn mealy? It wasn't toasted very much and got soggy quick. The shrimp are tiny little guys that you'd probably find at red lobster in their pasta. Also, pretty bland. \n\nGrilled chicken empanada: 2 stars. I've had empanadas made by my friends from Argentina, and it's all about the shell thing. This one was super thick! It was like eating an arepa with only a little bit of filling. Just way too carby for me. The grilled chicken in it was yummy though! I'd like to try it in an arepa next time. \n\nFried plantains: 3 stars. Not my cup of tea. Kind of slimy in texture. If they were fried in oil, I couldn't tell because there was no crisp, but because they are called fried plantains, I will assume they were doused in oil, which make it not worth the calories. \n\nGuava & cheese thing: 4 stars. Way better shell than the empanada and yummy guava with cheese. I wish the cheese was more melted but when I bit into it, it still looked like a solid block. \n\nOverall, I would stop by again if I'm in the neighborhood. Perhaps I'd ask for the arepa extra toasted just to make sure there aren't any soggy ones. I definitely want to try to the grilled chicken.

I wanted to try everything but I definitely didn't know where to start. Thank goodness for all the tasty looking pictures on the walls. The staff was very helpful and super patient with me. I've never had Venezuela food before, I can't wait to try more! \n\nFor my first visit, I figured it would be best to pick a column and work my way down so I went for the #1 Wood Fired Beef, my niece got the #8 Garlic Shrimp, and my Sister got a #12 Cachapa. They were all amazing! The cilantro mayo and the hot sauce mixed are killer. I also tried the soursop drink and it was so good, it tasted like strawberry, watermelon, kiwi, and passion fruit had a delicious baby juice in my cup.\n\nI can't wait to go back and add more to this amazing experience. For now, I'm heading next door to the Art of Flavors for dessert.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I've been here twice. The first time I got their special, it was wood-fired chicken thighs with rice with vegetables and black beans. I know their namesake is arepas but I think their wood-fire chicken steals the show. It was so delicious, moist, and tender, with that perfect kiss of fire. And the rice with vegetables and black beans were some of the best I ever had. Best part was the meal fed me for two days and it was around $6-7. \n\nI came here last night and had their namesake, the arepas. Arepas are dense muffins(?) made out of cornmeal, then cooked over an open fire. It was okay, it is really dense and  bland. You can't compare it to a tortilla or bread. It's just different, so my palate may have been confused. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't great. \n\nWe got the Wood-fire Beef Arepa and the Reina Pepiada Arepa (shredded chicken, cilantro, avocado, mayo and peas). They were okay. The meat inside the beef arepa was delicious. I think the flame-broiled meat dishes are the star of the show. It was flavorful and had that wonderful flame-kissed flavor. \n\nThe Reina Pepiada Arepa was similar to a chicken salad stuffed into an arepa. Pass. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't that good. \n\nMy favorite dish of the night was the Yucca Fritas, deep-fried yucca root. They are fat sticks of carby awesomeness. Pour their cilantro-garlic sauce on it and it is heaven! \n\nIn conclusion, I'd stick with their wood-fire beef and chicken and pass on the arepas. But be sure to order sides of their rice, beans and yucca fritas.

I went for the pork butt arepa ($4.50) and shredded beef arepa ($5.00), making the cheese upgrade ($0.50) for both. Fried corn filled with a decent quantity of meat is already a recipe for success, and you can add the cilantro sauce (in the yellow or one of the clear bottles) or the spicier red sauce that I sampled a bit of. I think the shredded beef actually had more flavor than the pork butt, but that means the pork butt is a better vehicle for the sauces.\n\nI also sampled my friend's fried plantain, which was about as mushy and brown as you'd expect if you just fried a plantain (or banana) on your own at home. Not very sweet at all, so it's rightfully listed as a side and not a dessert.\n\nThe prices could be better given the relatively small portion sizes - I wasn't too full afterward - and the arepas do lack just a bit of the extra oomph that would take it to the next level.

Total came to just over $15, which was a bit pricey IMO.\n\nThe arepas were unique and tasty, but fell a little short of my expectations. The shredded beef was a little on the dry side, but I perked it up with a bunch of the creamy cilantro sauce- that stuff is the bomb dot com. The reina pepiada arepa was tasty too, but the flavor simply got boring after a few bites. \nLuckily, the yucca was there to save the day: crispy and chewy and garlicky, it's everything yucca is supposed to be! The $3 price tag was a bit steep for the 12 bits that I got, most of which were half-pieces. Would I get them again though? Resounding yes.\n\nService was okay: minimal but friendly, brought out my take out to me at a table and took my order efficiently. Decor in the restaurant is fairly typical for a taqueria, but with the added touch of local artwork on the right hand wall as you walk in, all available for purchase. Though the pieces were good and added to the ambiance of the restaurant itself, I'm again taken by the sticker shock- the two paintings closest to me were $110 and $380. For folks advertising inside of a restaurant, that seems a bit unrealistic, but what do I know.\n\nMight come back and try a few different flavors, seems like the BF and I could share three- they look deceptively small but they're very filling.

I know I can't mention names, but I have had better Arepas out here in Vegas. Better in regards to price, value, and most importantly, taste. All is not lost though.

The Wood-Fired Beef was a bit dry during my third visit, but I brushed it aside attributing it to a fluke or bad timing. However, my last visit has solidified my disappointment and necessity to write an updated review.\n\nSince I've had five of their arepa options, I decided it was time for another one, so I chose the Vegetarian (avocado, black beans, tomato, peppers, onion) for $5. I was confused at first because all I saw were black beans with a little bit of avocado barely surfacing (reference photo). Maybe they got my order wrong? I searched for vegetables through the beans with no success. It wasn't until I took a few bites that I finally located a very sad tomato piece. I figured that was just how they made the \"Vegetarian\" arepa. The beans were nicely seasoned, but their overwhelming quantity made it incredibly difficult to eat in an arepa. The arepa itself was delicious, as always. I was already disappointed by my selection because of the lack of vegetables, then I saw photos of what the Vegetarian Arepa should look like or have looked like and now I'm upset. It costs the same as or more than their meat options and they can't include a heap of vegetables?

So good. \n\nI'm pretty sure this place was the former occupant of the current Goodwich Cube outside of Dinos, but it has moved waaaaay up in the world, and now has a clean, classy restaurant with a great patio and a ton of seating just across the street, in a lot with a kitsch shop, a lingerie store, and a Bail Bondsman. Ahhhhhh Vegas.\n\nPros:\n- Holy cow the food is delicious. Get two; an old favorite and then try something new. I've never had anything bad there.\n- The arepas themselves are perfect. I've had arepas at other places that get this weird \"cheap poorly made cornbread\" texture to them that is not at all pleasant. That is not the case here. Something like a cross between a crumpet and a tortilla, I imagine the manna God sent from heaven was actually arepas.\n- Sauces. They come in two generous tubes; one's spicy, one's garlicky. Yellow bottle. Do yourself a favor and just slather that on.\n- This is fast lunch food that's not at all fast food. Takes about 5-10 minutes from order to eating, depending on how busy they are. Unless you order the All The Meats plate, which takes a while, and feeds 3. \n- VERY affordable. You can eat a lunch that will make you full for dinner for about $12. \n- Seating for 2-14 comfortably.\n\nCons:\n- The other businesses in the strip mall give me the giggles.\n- You will want to eat ALL THE AREPAS, all the time, which will make you very fat.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I'm a bit torn in writing this review. \n\nI've had Viva Las Arepas (VLA) bookmarked for the better part of two years now, hell maybe more and it wasn't until recently had I been able to finally stop in. \n\nI love that there are still highly rated,  non-boojie, cheap, no frills food near the strip.

We also both agreed they needed more meat in them. \n\nI love the arepa itself, and they generously filled 'em with our protein of choice. Unfortunately, neither of us were impressed with their beef. It was tough and lacked flavor. Even with all that drippy sauce, there was just something amiss with the beef. \n\nThe pork butt I did enjoy. It was moist and tasty, and once I was carb loaded, I picked out all the pork and gobbled it all up. \n\nAs cheap a meal as I thought it would be, we still paid $30++. \n\nOverall, I'm saddened this long sought bookmark didn't wow me, but I wouldn't mind giving it another try.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 8, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "Talk about value - tasty arepas for less than $5.

The plate included an assortment of carne asada (charbroiled beef), gallo pinto (rice and red beans seasoned with garlic), platanos maduros (sweet fried plantains), platanos fritos (plantain chips), traditional cabbage coleslaw, and queso frito (fried cheese that is traditionally salty and dry).\n\n~Nacatamale: Made with Masa de maiz (dough made of grinded corn and butter) , olives,  tomatoes, onions, potatoes, filled with pork and vegetables and steamed in a banana leaf.\n\nThe service was fairly good.

Sahara Pavillion on S. Decatur and W. Sahara.  It's not pretty, but the people at the counter greet you with a smile and engaging conversation.  The entrance leads you to a small bakery/seating area filled with flyers and Colombian merchandise.  Off to the side is an opening to the larger room, where live bands and dancing take place on the weekends.  It's tight, old and messy with local business advertising their wares on a table jam packed with business cards and posters.\n\nI was ordering takeout and will continue to do so.  Not very inviting to sit down.\n\nThe food.  Having been deprived of my beloved Colombian food for too long, I placed quite a large order:\n\n-Empanadas (overstuffed mini cornmeal meat and potato pies)\n-Chicharron with arepa (pronounced 'chee-chah-rrohn' - don't forget to roll your 'r's. (fried pork rind with white cornmeal cake)\n-and the mother of Colombian plates, the Bandeja Paisa ('ban-deh-ha pie-sah).  A huge platter (enough for 2) of grilled steak (thin, but tasty), chicarron, red kidney beans, white rice, chorizo (choh-ree-zoh), fried ripe plaintain and a fried egg.\n\nTo be continued...", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 4, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "Ok first I should tell you my qualifications for being a reviewer of a Colombian restaurant. Both my parents are Colombian and I first generation American, so that means I love food (American) and I know what Colombian food SHOULD taste like (Colombian Mom who is/was a GREAT cook). My background aside. REVIEW: This restaurant is easy to miss. It's just outside of view from Decatur and a short walk from Sahara. We took Bus # 204 from the Strip Monorail to make it to this place. Well worth it! The restaurants carries all the favorites. Tamales, Bandeja Paisa (Colombian Smorgissbord of Food), Authentic Soups, Arepas, Pony Malta Drinks (yum), Shakes, Pastries, you name it. They do an excellent job covering the spectrum of Colombian cuisine/treats to take home with you. Now, the restaurant isn't very pretty on the inside. As you come in, it looks like more of a Hispanic hole in the wall shop (Bodega) than anything else, adjacent to it is the dining room with overused tables/chairs you'd find at a cheap Party store, the wall decorations are thrown together and appear dirty... the bathroom is well...functional. We were served by the little old lady of the house...who was very kind and hospitible...She informed us they've been there 7 years and business was OK. I was saddened to see such things as Cuban Sandwiches/Dishes on the menu...because I guess the locals craved such things and they must be good sellers. I think they have no place on the menu, but that's only my opinion. The food: SPOT ON Colombian, delicious, rice perfectly cooked, arepa/cheese gooey, airey, and scrumptious, and Tamale, just plain authentic and tastey. The restaurant must not be in the best of times, because it must be taking corners on food prep, certain ingredients looked to be missing from certain dishes and a full drumstick was taking up space in the center of our tamale...instead of pulling the bone/fat/joints from it. Otherwise the meal was perfect. Service: Slow and Forgetful, but you loved her anyways. Recommend it: Definitely!

But the dish did not taste as good as the picture looked.  Very bland and the cliantro wasn't fresh.  Also the yucca root was undercooked.  The plantains were decent.

The entrance to the \"club\" part is through some doors to the side that are \"guarded\" by a guy in dark clothing. I put quotes around \"guarded\" because it's not like he was checking IDs or anything.\n\nAnyway, the dance floor was fun.

I wanted something basic, like a gin and tonic, but she didn't understand what I was asking for. I'm not dinging them for that; I'm just mentioning it.

I guess that's one reason why I love this place, for taking me back to a childhood I almost forgot.\n\nI've never been to any other columbian eatery, but word is that the portions are huge. Which they were.. for me and my sister anyway. We shared this plate of \"Tamal\" which came with a side of rice. By the way, the rice was surprisingly sweet. Almost like sticky rice. It really complimented the spices in the tamal. I've also discovered the best made empanadas ever! probably even better than filipino empanadas =X. It's unique for it's crispy crust and its pasty potato & beef mix inside. And what set it in stone for me was the aji/ahji/ahhee (oh whatever the spelling is) sauce.\n\nThat place brought together family.

My sister and I were just planning to order some empanadas to go, but after meeting the owner and being fed his spanish greeting and his cultural energy, we decided to sit in. We looked thru the menu, very different of course, from a Mexican menu. But I have this weakness for tamales. So we ordered a couple empanadas and one Tamal, it comes with side of lightly sweet n sticky rice. Allow me to emphasize on the aji sauce. I love celantro and lime. Therefore I love this sauce. Dont be afraid to drench your empanadas in aji or drench you aji in empanadas. \n\nIts a family oriented little restaurant.

Maybe too authentic. Smallish seating area, kinda of confusing upon arrival, and the language barrier...if you speak Spanish, you're in, if you don't, well, there is some slight misunderstandings naturally. The big thing is the food is done very well and the portions generous. Very tasty food and done while you wait. That's the short story. \n\nNow for the longer story. Very obscure and strangely located on the inner corner of an out building in the SE corner of the strip mall where the Saver's is at Sahara and Decatur. \n\nWhen we arrived we were met and asked if we spoke Spanish. We don't. So they then located the one person who also spoke English and she asked if we had eaten Colombian food before. Well we had, and explained how and where. We were then told how Colombian food is not like Mexican food and other things we already knew. She was very patient. \n\nNOTE: I thought everyone knew Colombian food is more like Argentinian food than their Northerly cousins. Guess not. \n\nWe were then given sample empanadas, freshly made. Little pockets of joy is a better descriptive word. Especially when taken with a spoonful of the accompanying sauce. A must try if you go.\n\nWe ordered tongue on arepas ( corn cakes ) and Colombian chorizo on plantains. We also ordered the fruit drinks. Next time, we'll skip the fruit drinks. But if you order them, have them with milk. The watered ones separate too quickly and taste, well, watered down really. \n\nAnd we waited and waited. Not a problem for me. But the lady taking our orders seemed worried for me. I  am one who doesn't mind waiting for food prepared AFTER I order it, not waiting for me under the unhealthy glow of heat lamps ( think bad Chinese buffets ). So waiting is not a problem. Besides I like looking around. I'm nosy, what can I say? The dining area will NOT upstage the food. And the smell of the place is wonderful. Do NOT be in a hurry to eat. \n\nBUT...\n\nThe waiting is worth it. Except I got shredded beef, not tongue. Which was very nicely done, though. The food is filling and has fresh vegetable garnishes for cooling the palette. Nice. And the proportions generous. But I had to ask if they were out of tongue or didn't remember me ordering it. The gal thought she told me, but forgot. Honest mistake. At least she wasn't trying to slip one past this gringo. And I realize tongue isn't always available. But tell me first, and I'll order tripe soup or something else other than beef, which I can get anywhere.\n\nBottom line: I think this is the place where the food is King.

What I didn't anticipate was that more than half of them are still in my makeshift folder. This evening it was either Russian or Colombian. Russian place is closed and/or relocating.  So, it'll have to be Colombian.\n\nLast time I dined Columbian style was at Pueblito Viejo on Bird Street, Miami, FL http://www.yelp.com/biz/pueblito-viejo-no-2-miami#query:colombian%20restaurants in Miami, FL  It was like the second coming of Walt Disney. Eccentric, overwhelmingly eclectic to the max, animated and authentic Colombian from the moment I had set foot into that restaurant.\n\nNow keep that picture in mind and strip all those Disney characters from the ceiling and walls.  That's what Oiga, Mire, Vea Colombian Cuisine is simply about.  It's all about the muy rapido speaking server, a room fit for a union hall meeting and those monster black JBL speakers suspended from the ceiling.  Fortunately, it was not time for the partying to start.  So we got to dine in peace and quiet. Yelper Kevin P's review will tell you what it's like during party time. It's the work hard and play hard factor.\n\nOur server was quick to suggest sampling the following (talk about being lead by the nose):\n\nBunuelo:  round bread, fried, made from white corn flour and cheese\n\nEmpanada:  turn-over stuffed with meat and diced potatoes. Served with \"Aji\" homemade mild green sauce.\n\nBandeja Paisa:  Colombian traditional mix plate of grilled steak, fried pork rind, red beans, rice, chorizo, fried egg, in this case fried ripe plantain.\n\nAjiaco:  Chicken soup with Colombian yellow potatoes, domestic potatoes and corn on the cob,  Served with sour cream, capers, and rice.\n\nAs it turns out there's enough food for another meal for two.  In retrospect, the leftovers tasted even better.  To wash things down, we ordered a Colombian pina and their version of a cola soda. Our muy rapido server has now begun to call us \"her babies.\" She obviously took a liking to us.  We talked story about family.  She has a 37 year old son... you couldn't tell by looking at her (that's a compliment).\n\nOnce again I've tinkered with Colombian cuisine, I would very much like to taste more of this cultural mix of indigenous, Spanish, African, Arab and some Asian influences.

Just the 5 little tables and a lot of \"stuff,\" making it look like more of a convenience store than a restaurant.  On a weekday night, on the late-ish side, the only signs of life were the owner eating soup at one of the tables, and a young waitress newly arrived from Colombia, hesitantly speaking English.  No prob for me, since I speak Spanish.\n\nI was a little dismayed to think that this \"atmosphere,\" or lack thereof, would be the stage for our first venture at this restaurant, but then I heard noise and noticed those doors.  The waitress explained that there was a meeting taking place in there, and so it was off-limits.\n\nThe owner came over and gave us a thorough explanation of the menu, making suggestions, too.  We took most of them:  a couple of empanadas and an arepa de choclo to start (choclo is the word for corn in So. America), a meal-in-a-bowl soup and an Arroz con Pollo entree to share.  Right after we ordered, the small ragtag group - some biker types, some jocks - holding the meeting in the dining room adjourned, and we were able to move into the very big and much more pleasant room.  I wondered what was so secret about that meeting that it had to be kept private???  They couldn't have taken up more than a table or two.  \n\nThe empanadas were astoundingly good.  The arepa was a little too sweet for my taste; I don't know whether the corn was just naturally sweet or whether sugar is added to the dough.  It was topped with a mass of mozzarella cheese that was probably heated a bit too long - each bite was squeaking when I chewed it.\n\nThe soup was simply fantastic, a large bowl of tasty chicken broth that was not overly salty.  We chose the one that had shredded chicken, since we're too damned lazy to deal with chicken on the bone.  This one also came with potatoes instead of rice, which was perfect, since we were having Arroz con Pollo.  And therein lies the problem:  that dish was ghastly.  Both the chicken and the rice were completely dried out.  I threw some of the parsley condiment over it to moisten it, but it didn't really help.  Normally we're not shy about complaining or returning a dish that isn't up to snuff, but this time I was too full from the soup and appetizers to start in with the wait for another dish.  So when the waitress passed by and asked about our food, I told her about the dried-out dish.  She asked if we wanted to change it for something else, and we declined the offer.\n\nBut here's the kicker, and the one thing that has really soured me about this place:  I was already outside when my husband went to the register to pay the bill, and he mentioned to the owner about the dried-out rice and chicken.  The response:  \"Well, rice dishes are always dry.\"  Really?  Tell that to Mr. Risotto.  And that was the sum total of the answer.  No apology, and no acknowledgement that maybe that pot of chicken and rice had been reheated a few times too many. \n\nAny restaurant can have problems with any dish.  I've gone back over and over to restaurants at which we had problems, mainly because the owners were genuinely concerned about the quality of the food and desire for the customer to have a positive dining experience.  On the other hand, why should I return to a place where the reaction to a critique is a shrug, even if there are enough good things on the menu to warrant a second visit?

Be careful, the food is filling and I can never finish my plate.\n\nMy favorite dish is the Arroz ala Vallencia, which is basically rice with chicken, shrimp, onions, peppers, etc.  It's served with their hot black bean mash type thing, 2 chips, and 2 home-made tortillas.  Their fresh, hot tortillas are the best, especially dipped in the beans.\n\nAnd as with all my favorites, they serve Mexican Coke (the soda), as well as Jarritos and a few other bottles familiar to most Spanish-speakers.\n\nPlan to spend a while here.  The service is great, but rushing is not part of the experience.  Relax.  Eat a pupusa (kind of like a stuffed, doughy tortilla pancake... with stuff inside it).\n\nDelcious restaurant, authentic and very reasonably priced.

It was 11a.m. and we were hungry we thought hmmm bachi burger..no not bachi burger and it was then I realized I had this Mexican delivery place bookmarked on Yelp! Seeing how I was doing laundry and had nothing to wear this seemed like a much better choice. By the time we made the decision to order it was about 1230. I had to leave my house by 230 to pick up my kids.

I ordered 2 orders taquitos mixto,chicken asada torta with no beans, shrimp cocktail, alfredo nachos, 1 shrimp taco, 1carne asada taco,1 carnitas taco, and there supposed super hot salsa. I click to order and it tells me my food will be delivered at 240! So of course this convenient on line ordering has me on the phone with them anyway and the gentleman on the phone was great! He said no problem I will have your order to you faster than that. Great!!! My food arrives at 2pm awesome just enough time.

Well here we go\n\nTaquitos mixto: Every one of them tasted different very inconsistent..I know they are all different flavors but what im saying is my chicken one was good, my hubbys chicken one was dry and crunchy chicken inside and they were all soggy but I guess that's what you get for ordering delivery fried food.    The sogginess I understand but I would suggest not plating fried food on a bed of lettuce for delivery and put holes in the containers so the condensation doesn't build up.\n\nChicken asada torta: Bread was hard my hubby thought it was gross I took a bite thought it was ok thank you for not putting beans He HATES beans\n\nShrimp Cocktail: Im trying to be nice but it made me throw up it tasted like someone put Kool-Aid in tomato sauce with shrimp\n\nAlfredo nachos: This made me so mad!!! This is what my hubby wanted the most we didn't say no beans because on the menu it doesn't have beans on it!!!!! Open it up what was there??? BEANS!!!! All over the whole freakin thing so of course he wont eat it! He did manage to stick his finger in one spot to taste the alfredo he said it was good I took a bite it tasted pretty good but I had my own food, I didn't want that he did! AND AGAIN all soggy maybe for delivery you can deconstruct it in containers and just put the chips in the box youll have a better outcome I think people would rather assemble it themselves (although there are a lot of idiots that would probably need instructions) then have them soggy.\n\nThe Tacos: Shrimp one was weird not good or bad just weird, carne asada tasted like they reheated it and over cooked it very dry and hard to eat, carnitas was pretty much the same dry and hard.\n\nSalsa: Most white people would think it was super spicy, I eat habaneros for fun so for me it was ok on spice pretty good flavor\n\nAll in all I ordered 50 bucks worth of inedible food we threw most of it out it sucked cause these people are so nice I might try to stop in sometime and give them a try so maybe I can give them a better review!

Either way, the service was pretty bad and the cashier/waitress rolled her eyes at us. The waitress didn't speak English so my salvadoran wife had to order.  It took about 30 minutes for them to make our food.  The waitress didn't say a word to us the entire time.  She stayed in the Back the whole time.  When we got home and actually tried the food it was decent. The papusas are a little on the thick side from all the masa and the carne asada papusas have very little meat.  I'd recommend the pork and cheese and the bean and cheese.  This place would have to be the all out last resort for salvadoran food in this city.  It's not bad. .

Mashed, grated and sliced, there are 101 ways to cook a plantain. Maduros ($3.99) are sliced, then deep fried, making a sort of a thick chip. Another variation, Ara\u00f1itas ($3.99), uses shredded plantain to make golden nests with a side of ketchup and mayo sauce for dipping.\n\nRelleno de Papas ($3.99) are baseball-sized mashed potato balls filled with seasoned ground beef, then deep fried.

Not exactly a high-end neighborhood.\n\nBut after having heard of this little cafe in The New Times and finding that Phoenix Magazine rated their Ceviche and Shrimp salad as one of the Valley's top 50 dishes, we decided that we must give it a try! The article in New Times raved about something called a Pupusa and description sounded familiar, once we were there I realized why.\n\nEvery culture on earth seems to have developed some form of stuffed hand pie. You know the formula, a regional bread or pastry dough, formed into a pocket and stuffed with savory or sweet fillings. Food on the go. Well in El Salvador it's called a Pupusa, and they were delicious!\n\nA kind of thick corn tortilla type bread, filled with several different types of  fillings, pork and cheese, beans, chicken and cheese, beef and cheese or beef, bean and cheese.\n\nNow this is NOT your typical Arizona/Mexican food. The cheese is a freshly made cheese that is a Salvadoran tradition and is one of the best fresh cheeses I have ever had, smooth and soft yet very flavourful. The tortilla is not what you might be used to either, they are corn tortillas but they are not the course chip like corn tortillas so prevalent in Americanized Hispanic foods. They are thick, soft and delicious. It is this tortilla that is the basis of their Pupusas.\n\nDon't expect to find the standard \"Mexican Restaurant\" re-fried beans here either. Spicy, flavourful and smooth, having been mashed right after cooking, they are among the best example of simple yet wonderful tastes you will experience here.\n\nWe had some of all of the different Pupusas offered on the menu which are priced very reasonable indeed, and were impressed with all of them, though the pork and cheese and the bean were my personal favorites.\n\nWe also had a corn tamale that was sweet and moist and tasty, rolled in a banana leaf instead of the corn husk we are used to. Perhaps that is why it was so much more moist than your average corn tamale.\n\nTo finish off our repast we enjoyed the fried plantains, actually an appetizer on the menu, they were crispy on the outside and starchy and tasty inside. Served with freshly made salsa and the Salvadoran version of Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche that was also a hit.\n\nThe owner was our server and I am still not sure she spoke much English, but she was very nice to us and the orders were always right. As well as very very hot! I had to let my Pupusas sit a few minutes before they were cool enough to consume, and a word of warning, Plantains retain heat even better than potatoes do so proceed carefully.\n\nAs I've said the Ceviche and Shrimp salad is an award winner and the Carne Asada that the folks at the next table had ordered looked delicious. However I could not ask their opinion as they did not seem to speak English either and my Spanish is worse than terrible. But they seemed to be enjoying it, I'll give it a try next time.\n\nThey serve breakfast too and I can hardly wait to give that a try as well.\n\nStop in, you'll be glad you did.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 3, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "It was blind luck that I stumbled across ceviche over 10 years ago as a young lad living in Los Mochis, Sinaloa.

The true stars are the pupusas, which I had never had before and have since become addicted too. I literally order at least 6 for myself every time I go now. They are asininely delicious!!! I grab a large bite of pupusa and some of the curtido (a kind of slaw-ish awesomeness) and just chow down. Beware the post-lunch coma though as eating that many will knock the average person on their ass. This brings me to my one bone to pick with this stripmall gem, their coffee sucks!

Continuing on, a veritable gauntlet of strip malls appear offering all types of wares, services, in a strictly lower middle income suburbia.  The next area is a heavily hispanic area with nary an English sign in sight, besides Massage brazenly displayed along shaded glass storefronts.  Finally, our destination appears, and it is truly in an imposing corner, flanked by a Big Lots, great america, and a pawn shop, complete with a watchful security guard along the storefront.

Pressed pockets of incredible goodness inside a expertly pressed tortilla, was served with a mild salsa and curtido- spicy, peppery pickled vegetables.  Combining all of these components, I have abandoned my long-standing vow to hate all those who use bumper stickers and have been inspired to promote the cause, I love (heart symbol) pupusas.  \n\nAs this was my first foray into Salvadorian food, I also ordered Lengua Guisada, which came as 3 slabs of stewed beef tongue, covered in a slightly sour tomato based sauce.  The sourness combined with the beef tongue's gamey texture I found very pleasing, but this was slightly below room temperature, and definitely marred my enjoyment of this dish.\n\nBoth of our entrees also came with pedestrian rice and watery black beans, with the latter being flavorful but far too liquidy.  I also had a cup of Sopa de Res con Chipilin with my entree, which tasted like countless other Sopa de Res elsewhere.  \n\nPupusas were absolutely wonderful, but the full experience was marred by my weaker entree and the side dishes.

I used to go to a really good Salvadorian restaurant in Seattle, and was excited to see there was one right near where I live now. So the BF and I got here at around 8 at night on a Sunday and it was actually pretty busy. This place is in a tiny strip mall that does not look like it gets much business, and I would have never seen it from the road, so it must be good to still be in business. So I ordered a pollo pupusa, a carne asada pupusa, and a polla tamale, and the BF ordered two bean and cheese pupusas and a carne asada pupusa and we split the pastelitos con papas y queso. Well, the pastelitos were pretty tasty, like fried mashed potatoes, and they came with a spicier cabbage slaw which I liked a lot better than the regular cabbage slaw for the pupusas. All of the pupusas were really good, my real problem was with the sauce. The red sauce that came with them was just kind of flavorless. The place I used to go to had some really good red and green sauces for the pupusas... it was kind of disappointing. Also, about 5 minutes after we got the pupusas, the waitress came by and said 'oh I forgot to tell you we don't have any tamales.' Well, that kind of sucks, why did it take til we were already in the middle of eating to tell us? Also, it screwed up the amount I was trying to spend (since I had 20$ to spend on the deal chicken) which I guess shows that this place is cheap, which is good, but for this particular trip that wasn't good. So we decided to order a dessert to replace the tamale. We got the empanadas de platano with sweet cream. So this was a big deal for the waitress, she had already totaled out the bill and for some reason it was a huge deal to add a dessert at the end (which I thought was weird, but felt guilty about giving her extra work). Anyway, the empanadas were ok, but I've had better. The sweet cream is in the middle of the plantain and it isn't all that sweet.

I noticed that I was the only gringa in the place - a good sign that the food is muy authenitico.\n\nThe waitress brought my drink along with a nice, crisp cole slaw type salad with some greens in it that I was not able to identify, but which gave it a nice flavor.

Nice, big slices of tongue braised in a wonderful mild tomato type sauce, served with rice that had veggies in it, and small dish of liquified black beans along with two of the most succulent corn tortillas I have ever eaten. Instead of being crisp and crunchy, these were firm on the outside, and soft and tender on the inside. For the more adventurous, there is also hot sauce on the table. The flavors were all wonderful, and I used the corn tortillas to mop up all of the sauce on the plate. I would be lax if I didn't mention the fact the that food was served steaming hot.\n\nI had to try the Pupupas, which are stuffed corn tortillas which are then grilled. I tried two different ones, and although I was entitled to get rice and bean with them, I opted not to have them because I was already getting full. The first Pupupas was stuffed with shrimp and cheese, and had a lovely texture and flavor. They have a tomato based sauce on the table that you can slather on your Pupupas if you so desire. I found that it really augmented the flavor and ended up using it on both Pupupas. The second Pupupas was shredded pork and cheese, and while tasty, wasn't up to the flavor profile of the camerones.\n\nUnfortunately, by this time I was stuffed and had no more room to try anything else, but I will be back to try some more. Next time I want to try the Sopa de Pata/Mondongo, which is a hearty soup of heart and beef tripe, along with the Ensalada de Camarones Asados, which is a grilled shrimp salad.\n\nIt's hard to leave here hungry - you really would have to work at it!\n\nSanitation was good and the place is handicapped aware.

It's one way to enjoy various cultural experiences without investing too much money just in case. Obviously the restaurant can well benefit from the exposure without costing them too much. It's $20 voucher that I've paid $10 ahead. The restaurant only got $5 I believe. And I did Yelp! extensively before hitting the BUY button.\n\nI understand that it's hard to find authentic foods in USA. Everything is Americanized for one reason or the other. Most Americans I know (not those that I don't know) can't handle strange taste, texture, weirdness, repulsion, and various dislikes. And I know that it's hard to get the same fresh or processed ingredients and spices from home countries.\n\nThose are my pet peeves alright. And there is one more before I get onto the review. Comparison can be deadly.\n\nI have tried Latin American foods (including Yucatan, Oaxaca, Belizean). So my knowledge is nil on Venezuelan foods. But I do have taste buds and experiences from various food cultures.\n\nOverall. It sucked. I was referring to the taste, variety, and uniqueness. It didn't worth my dime. My friend and I had the Media Bandeja (1/2 the regular portion) for $25. The big plates came with 2 big serving of steamed white rice, 2 small cups of black beans sprinkled with cheese, half an ordinary avacado, 2 fried eggs (Chinese style, I cooked that all the time), 2 plain arepas (round flat breads), one chorizo sausage, one blood sausage, 2 scopes of shredded beef, one small steak, few green plantains, and few sweet plantains.\n\nThe blood sausage tasted like burned tired. I had blood pudding much tastier and smoother and more colorful that that. I grew up with blood pudding. Yummy!!! That maybe the reason that I'm vicious now. Heed my warning, it's not good for cholesterol.\n\nThe steak had tasty flavor; it's ordinary though. I believe it's 5 oz shrunk to 3 oz. The shredded beef reminds me of sloppy Joe. It's OK for the taste. The sweet plantains are regular fried plantains as found in some Chinese buffets or regular dessert menu. It's good for the sweetness but nothing more than that in this restaurant.\n\nIf you give me a steam bun or silver thread roll (both are steamed rice dough), I can tell how much salt it contains, the chewing satisfaction, the freshness, and the steamed distinct aroma. And I can eat it plain. Arepas? What's that? It's an tasteless, odorless, chewy carb that didn't excite my taste buds a bit. Boring!!! Honestly, I had no clue how special it was supposed to be. It tasted better after I stuffed avocado and shredded beef inside.\n\nThe green plantains were like hard cardboard. Fried carb without taste, but it has a green tinted color.\n\nMy friend also ordered Tequenos (fried breaded cheese sticks)... really tiny for $1 each. Chinese egg rolls ($1 each) are twice as big and they are greaser and tastier. (I ain't a size queen).\n\nThe Empanada Ham Queso was so tiny with 2-bite size for $4. Come on... are you kidding me!!! Calzones are more complicated and much bigger with ham and cheese and more ingredients, for similar price. (Again, I ain't a size queen).\n\nMy point is that it's so ordinary that I couldn't see the cost value especially for Bandeja. I can serve up the same plates at home with minimal cost. I know the restaurant needs to earn money for cooking, serving, paying wages, and renting the space.\n\nWe were the only table that night. The wait service was ordinary... between a bus boy and minimalist. The ambient was plain... and not a place you expect to pay $40 for two (before Groupon).\n\nSo diners, I enjoy a chance to have a different cultural experience. You should give it a try. Due to a lack of familiarity, the foods tasted bland and boring. I don't feel like gaining any new knowledge except a few words on the foods. I feel like they were serving home cooked meals or peasant foods as ambrosia and they charged accordingly. That's my problem with this restaurant.

Our cuisine is very different. Trying to compare it to Mexican or Chinese is moot because A) it is not at all similar and B) these are widely available and thus price is a competing point. If you've had Panamanian or Columbian food then you can draw comparisons, but the region is pretty unique otherwise. Yes, it is greasy; but that's exactly how it is back home. It might help to point out that we're used to eating where we order instead of driving with our food.\n2. A lot of the ingredients are imported. Most are very hard to find in the area, and in fact most simply were not available 1 or 2 years ago when the restaurant opened. Thus, the ingredients are expensive and you pay a premium for that.\n3. The food is authentic. It says a lot that every time I go I run into a Venezuelan I know. Heck, every once in a while they have parties in there and it doesn't feel like you're in the U.S. If you don't like that's fine, but you can't really tell me it isn't authentic.\n\nThis is mostly for the people that are thinking about going.

Seemed more like farmer john boiled ham in cubes then a real smoked or cured ham. Don't get me wrong it tasted good, but if I wanted lunch meat I would have got a sandwich. \n\nPro's\nSome of the nicest people I have met. The girl that waited on me was respectfully dressed. She was kind, courteous, and more than willing to go over everything on the menu and make recommendations. There was a gentleman on a laptop that introduced himself to me, shook my hand, and thanked me for coming in.  There was a slightly older gentleman that held the door open for me, and everyone thanked me for coming in and asked me to come again as I left. Finally, the food is very reasonably priced. \n\nFood-\nNow as i said before in my opinion, I though the empanadas themselves were a bit on the small side. However, they are budgeted for their size. So don't walk in thinking 1 or 2 is probably going to feed you if you have a big appetite. I came in with the attitude of  the empanadas would be the size of a cornish pasty. When I saw the price I was like wow this is going to be a great deal.  It ended up being a fair deal.  Their pork is pretty decent. Their black bean and cheese was really good, their cubana which is pork, ham, cheese. I was slightly disappointed because again what I expected was not what I got. I figured it would be a shaved smoked or a cured ham.  The sides I got were black beans and rice.  Plus a cabbage salad.   All fairly decent, nothing to right home about. \n\nFinal thoughts-\nSpice it up, maybe try a different type of ham and don't be afraid to tell people empanada's are hand sized. It's the only thing keeping me from giving five stars. In all honesty, I probably would have given three stars on the food because nothing stuck out as great or terrible.

Two is enough to fill me up at lunch, but I could probably eat more if naptime were an option afterwards.

I won't go into too much detail, but I will say that it was good.  Not amazing, but good.  However, I have never had El Salvadorian food before, so maybe I needed to be broken in.\n\nI started with the mango iced tea which tasted a little like dirt, not horrible, but had a dirt flavor to it if that makes any sense.  I saw the guys next to me get these bright neon yellow drinks with chunks floating in them and decided I must try it.  It turned out it was the ensalada drink, which I thought meant \"salad\" but maybe that's my American translation.  Apparently it means \"delicious fruit salad\" drink.  I ate the chunks out of it, trying to figure out what each one was.  I was thinking it was something exotic, so I made Bri try it, turns out it was apple.  Oops.  So it has apple, pineapple and carrot chunks, maybe not exotic, but still delicious.\n\nThe little shooter of soup is good.  Its like a chicken noodle without the noodle with potatoes thrown in for good measure.  I got the appetizer combo that Michelle got, it was plenty of food for a meal.  I don't know what was what, but I like the flat tortilla looking thing with the cheese the best...it was either a pupusa or a posteles, but it was good!  The tamale was different than the typical, it was not wrapped in a corn husk but what looked like a palm frond, but I could be wrong.  Heck, I couldn't even identify an apple that day!  It also had shredded chicken, potatoes and carrots in it.  Very tasty.  They also serve this soupy tomatoey salsa that is very mild.  That, combined with the slaw they serve as a garnish really adds some taste to most of the items.  They also give you 1 \"tortilla\" per person.  Its their version of a tortilla, but much different than the Mexican version.  This is much smaller, and thicker, almost like a pita, gordita or fry bread.  My friend got some sort of chicken dish with a large amount of what looked like sour cream underneath it.  Unfortunately for him, he hates sour cream, but some rearranging of the plate and some dousing in tomatoey salsa and he was good to go.\n\nI tried to order the \"quesadilla\" dessert thing that Michelle  mentioned because I truly wanted to know what the bastard child of cheesecake and cake would taste like, plus the name was intriguing...but they were out.  They were also out of their carne asada, which looked good.  Other people had some. \n\nIt was busy when we were there, but the service was good and everyone was really friendly.  There was even a very large table of about 15 people in there celebrating a birthday and everyone (OK, well me and my friend and the servers) sang to them.  \n\nI think I want to go back now and try the chile relleno and some more of the \"tortilla\" wrapped cheesy meaty deliciousness.\n\nUPDATE - \nI wonder if that's a record for an update (10 minutes)!\nI just noticed in the beginning I said I won't go into too much detail, then proceeded to go into perfect detail.

A quick Yelp search turned up Eliana's and since it was on my way home from the airport, I decided to stop in to get my fix. Initially, I only planned on getting the combo platter and ensalada drink. Then I started thinking back on my fond memories of pupaserias (sp?) in the Mission district of SF so I flagged down the waiter to have that added on to my order. \n\nMy ensalada drink arrived w/ a little cup of chicken & potato soup which instantly made my stomach do a little churn. I'm not sure if it was because the ensalada drink looked like a liquid highlighter or the fact that an ice cold beverage was served with a hot soup, but being the starving beast that I was, I took a sip of the glow-stick and devoured the tasty chicken soup. I couldn't really figure out if the drink tasted like anything other than sweet water w/ a few pieces of fruits & carrot, but it was interesting to order nonetheless.  \n\nNot sure what to say about the pupusa and combo platter other than, it was very MOIST. I'm sure you're thinking, \"WTH how could she describe a pupusa, empanada, pasteles and tamale as moist?,\" but trust me, it was a lot odder for me to taste these unexpectedly moist items. I'm not sure it was moist from the meat juices or grease but I ate a few bites of each item and left the rest. Feeling rather unfulfilled from everything, I decided to order the quesadilla dessert.

It's close to my work, and it sounded like such a nice departure from my usual lunchtime rounds. This past weekend, my boyfriend and I went to dinner there, because I thought it deserved a second try. I'll tell you a little about both experiences. \n\nAfter perusing all of the (mostly) helpful and honest reviews here, I really psyched myself out about giving it a try and just HAD to go there for takeout that VERY SAME DAY - I'm not a delayed gratification kind of person, despite my best efforts. I ended up at the restaurant at around 11:00, and it was empty. The lady behind the counter seemed a little frosty at first, but then she started in with calling me \"mija,\" and I was a goner. I'm not sure why, but some little, older lady calling me a term of motherly endearment always softens me right up. \n\nI ordered the Pollo Encebollado, described in the menu only as \"chicken with onions.\" Hm. Well, I like chicken, and I like onions...so...that sounded pretty good! I was imagining something akin to an El Salvadorian fajita. As I picked up my order and drove back to work to enjoy it at my desk, visions of chunks of seasoned chicken and sauteed onions danced through my head. I settled down at my desk, took a deep breath, opened the nicely wrapped Styrofoam container, and...chicken on the bone? What? Who said anything about chicken on the bone? With some reddish, tomatoey-looking sauce? What is this? Where are the delicious, unauthentic strips of white meat chicken? The browned onions, all oily and slippery? THIS ISN'T FAJITAS! \n\nWell, no. It isn't fajitas...fajitas are somewhere else on the menu. This is Pollo Encebollado, and I didn't know what I was ordering. Pollo Encebollado, at Eliana's, is two drumsticks covered in a flavorful, tomato-based sauce, paired with a few cooked onion slices. The meal includes rice, beans, and tortillas, but I went for double rice, which is kind of yellow in color and studded with chopped carrots and onions. The tortillas are like fat little pancakes that taste like tortillas, if that's not a completely ignorant description. \n\nI don't generally eat chicken on the bone, but, hey. I ordered it, I was really wanting to try it, so I broke a personal rule and dove in. While it wasn't quite what I had imagined, I liked it well enough and was able to finish it. \n\nI wasn't sure what to think. I wasn't too into it...definitely not enough to order that same thing again, but I didn't want to write Eliana's off completely, based merely on some weird, prissy, arbitrary issue I have with chicken on the bone. \n\nI told my boyfriend about the restaurant, and suggested that we go try it out together. He had actually heard of it before from a Salvadorian coworker who raves about it frequently.\n\nWe went on a Friday evening at around 5:00...the restaurant was, again, nearly empty. A very friendly man seated us and took our drink orders.\n\n I first tried the Orchata, which was very different from the Mexican variety I'm sure most of us are familiar with. It was actually a milky brown in color, rather than white...it looked, to me, like a glass of chocolate milk. The color, I found out later, comes from the addition of an ingredient called Morrow Seed. It also tastes a little different, in a way that is hard to explain...I'd also probably chalk that up to the Morrow Seed. \n\nFor our entrees, my boyfriend had the Chile Relleno, and I ordered the Arroz a la Valenciana...mostly because it is painted on the outside of the restaurant, and seems to be their \"hallmark\" dish. \n\nNote: before your order arrives, you receive a salty little cup of chicken soup. I wasn't too into the soup itself, but I was oddly touched by the effort to add a little something extra and a little something nice to the dining experience. Maybe I'm a sappy weirdo. Well, not maybe, I definitely am, but between the \"mija\"s and the cute little soups, I felt very charmed by the man and woman working there, and really, really wanted to enjoy my food so I could write a big, long review on Yelp about how wonderful their restaurant is. \n\nNeither my boyfriend or I really enjoyed either of our dishes. My dish was served cold, which I wasn't expecting, and seemed very flavorless to me...other than the unusual taste of bananas I seemed to pick up from the rice. The man helping us suggested that I pour the bean substance on my dish to \"create a new flavor.\" I thought this was also a really cute thing to say, but, unfortunately, I followed his advice and did not enjoy the \"new flavor\" I created. All in all, I enjoyed the Arroz a la Valenciana much less than the Pollo Encebollado.\n\nAnnnnd I'm out of characters.

My dad used to be a chef in his country but he doesn't cook anymore.

(Yucca is an ornamental plant that does not have the root of the yuca and is commonly confused with Yuca.) On the menu for appetizers is Yuca frita o sancochada-which is basically the root fried or boiled.

Sweet green chile cornbread drowned in this chunky salsa type stuff with shredded pernil.  I didn't know what pernil was before but now I cannot do without it at least twice a month.  Fuego's is so tender...so flavorful.  And on top of this cornbread, its just absurd.  I could eat this anytime, any day.\n\nSpeaking of pernil, the first thing I had here was the Pernil Torta.  Actually, a coworker let me taste a little piece and I ranted on that whole day about how good it was.  Its just that it has this specific taste that my grandmother's pork ribs had.  I thought I'd never get that taste again, and who knew it'd be at a Mexican place.  The only complaint with this sandwich is the bread...i don't like it.  It doesn't...go.  If this was on texas toast, i would be eating one right now.\n\nI've also tried the tacos and the nachos.  Both offer a lot of food.  The tacos are on par with any good taco I've had.  The nachos are huge and got a lot of different good flavors going on.  I'd recommend either.\n\nMy second favorite thing to get here are the empanadas.  The only empanada i ever knew anything about was Taco Bell's desert ones.  These ain't that.  These have beef, cheese, peppers, stuff, more stuff and some other stuff in this perfect pocket crusty flaky thing.  And there is a sweetness to it all that makes these irresistible.  I am always torn between these or the cornbread.\n\nThe value is normal downtown stuff.  You do get a large amount of food, though...so you shouldn't feel sour after you shell out at least $10 bucks for lunch.  You'll probably have leftovers (yeah right).\n\nThe staff are always friendly, although they are really busy all the time.  I've had to stand around a lot even after waiting to come in after I call ahead.  Standing around wouldn't be so bad if the layout of the place didn't suck.

It needed an acidic and/or creamy counterpoint. I think I asked for a side of ranch dressing and doctored my sandwich so that it was more agreeable. The sweet potato fries that the sandwich came with were a bit confused too. Although they were delightfully crispy, they were served with ketchup. Sweet potato fries plus sweet ketchup equals sweet sweet bleh!

I can say that they need to seriously consider what will taste good, what flavors balance together, and what people like to eat (hint: maybe more fresh ingredients instead of relying on pre-cooked batches of food that are dispensed onto bread posthaste).

The waiter had recommended them, and they were a very memorable part of the meal. The meat was very flavorful, and the sauce and cheese that accompanied the meat really made the slider \"pop\". It was a little sweet, a little spicy, but perfectly balanced. \n\nThe BBQ Pork Quesadilla was also delicious. The BBQ sauce was not overbearing, which played well to the quesadillas traditional roots. The sauce it came with appeared to be a chipotle style sour cream/mayo and was very good, although the quesadilla didn't really need much else.\n\nMy friends both ordered a Dos Equis ($1 Off), and I asked the waiter to surprise me. He brought me an in-house jalapeno infused margarita. Wow was it good! I was not expecting the spiciness at first, but as my pallet adjusted, I literally could not put it down. I am also not one to like salt on my margarita, but with the spiciness from the jalapenos, the salted rim helped tone it down nicely.\n\nFor our main entrees, I got the Blackened Tilapia Caesar Salad, my friend got the Pernil Tacos, while my other friend got the Empanadas. \n\nI really enjoyed the Caesar salad, it was a nice twist on a classic dish. Black beans, corn, and spiced tortilla strips gave it a nice \"southwestern\" flair. The tilapia also had a southwestern seasoning that made it delicious on its own. I appreciated the temperature of the fish when it came out. Not too hot, and definitely not cold. I cannot stand having burning hot food on a salad, effectively making the lettuce warm.\n\nI got to try a bite from each of my friends. Both dishes were excellent. The Pernil Tacos came out as traditional street tacos (double wrapped corn tortillas). The pernil as excellent. The tacos come in a variations of meat and fish, but we went with the waiters recommendation, and were not disappointed. \n\nI have never had empanadas before, and was really blown away. The inside was very rich and flavorful, I believe they use chorizo inside. The fried crunchy exterior made for an interesting texture compared to the inside.

Typically I don't like going to branch locations of locally based chains as I've usually found the quality of the food and overall experience to be lacking versus the main location.  \n\nBut this experience was different.  The menu is a little trimmed down from Fuego's main location, but the prices are much more affordable and the menu still contains many of their greatest hits.  The Cityscape location is much more of an urban modern theme than the main location which is more of a sit down living room feel.  We skipped the appetizers and went straight for the house specialties.  She got the tacos and I got the empanadas.  The empanadas were just as delicious as Fuego's mothership, with delicious ground beef, a flaky pastry crust and great toppings.  She got a tilapia and pernil (pulled pork) taco.  The sauce and coleslaw definitely complimented the tacos well, but the meat was what made them so awesome.  For a drink she got the Fuego margarita (infused with jalapenos).  She loved it.  I had a sip and it was a little too intense for me so I got the red sangria.  Again, just as delicious as their main location.\n\nBut the reason I give this place 5 stars more than any other reason is our waiter.  Bald guy (didn't catch his name), but he was outstanding.

The pork shoulder is offered on the dinner menu which I haven't had yet so I ceased the opportunity to order it for lunch.  3 open face tacos were brought to me presented on a long plate with a couple of lime wedges.  3 mini tacos over corn tortillas had more than satisfied my appetite to experience this dish.

I love to eat out and try to do so as often as I can (or cash flow allows), so me and girlfriend tried 2 apps with 2 main dishes trying to get a feel for the food and enjoy a good dinner. First, when we walk in the place it was very empty and it still took the hostess a bit long to seat us, why? I don't know. Second, we have a seat take a look at the menu and the server greets us (by the way nice server but kind of spacey) he takes are drink orders and recommends a few dishes. After a while we get our drinks but not the bottle of water that I wanted and paid for (it never got there) and the cocktails were imaginative but bland. To spare going into details the food was not bad, but just okay. After all the hype I was expecting more but honestly if I wanted great modern Mexican/Latin food I would definitely go somewhere else like - Mucho Gusto or Barrio Cafe ECT.... I think that what made me realize that I would not come back here is, when I felt the snotty and stuck up feel of this place when I responded to one of the employees about what I thought about my meal. I wasn't rude but said it was just okay but they made me feel like I was wrong for not loving it. The staff is a bit arrogant or at least similar to how this town seems to be and the prices reflect that... I am by no means cheap but $12+ drinks?, portions that don't match the prices(way over priced for what it is) call me what you like but I'll stick to great food and some what reasonable prices somewhere else. If the food were amazing the price wouldn't even be an issue i.e. Mastro's City Hall. Like I said earlier seems kind of odd that some people have given this place 5 stars when it's avrage at best. In a city were there are places that deserve high praise(4-5 stars) this is not one of them. The Mission honestly gets 2.5 to 3 stars for food, 3 for the setting (kinda cool but trying to be too trendy) but lost it when it came to the service, drinks and overall lackluster food, portions/price. I love Matt's other place Zinc Bistro but this just makes me wonder about chefs crossing over to cuisines that they enjoy eating but perhaps don't understand.

We started off with the absolutely amazing almejas al vapor - clams, rock shrimp, chorizo, and more in a delicate but pungent broth with grilled bread to soak it up with. For entrees, the swordfish veracruz and the scallop dish both were fantastic.

Although I understand that they were trying to make the most of  space, the bulk of the tables are done in long booths with chairs on the opposite side of the table.  This means that you have tables (in most cases) immediately to the left and right of you.  While conversant with your table, you are privy to the entire conversation of the tables on either side of you and vice-versa. I find this distracting.   The mane private table requires a group of at least 6.  So, privacy is limited.  The lighting is very low, which while adding to the atmosphere, does nothing for trying to read the menu.  I would be fine with this if there was enough candle light on the table to tilt your menu to to read, but that isn't even close to adequate.

Ok, well, in restaurant world, that is...I make no promises about the real world.\n\nSeriously, I don't think I can complain about anything, so let's just get on to the food. I started with a blended Lemon Margarita that was yum-tastic...the first time I tried the Mango (the flavors change daily), and it was better, but I'm not one to poo-poo any blended Margarita that comes my way, and The Mission's are particularly good. Anyway, we ordered the tableside guac to munch on before our meals arrived, and it was DELISH. Delish. Granted, it's only 1 avacado, but it didn't feel like too little guac, and we had 4 people. Anyway, they do this thing where they drizzle extra virgin olive oil over it at the end, and as WEIRD as that sounds, it makes it REALLY GOOD. I have no idea why. But it does.\n\nFor our entrees, we each ordered some version of the tacos, either chicken or skirt steak. I LOVED the skirt steak tacos...they were so good. They come tecate marinated with green chili salsa, avocado, lime, cilantro and cotija, and all of the flavors just work together magnificently...I think each one took me no more than 2 bites to eat. My friend that ordered the chicken tacos said they were fabulous, too, and after he tried the steak tacos, he said they were actually BETTER...I find that hard to believe, but I'll have to try them next time and find out! \n\nIn addition to the tacos, we got the Mission Fries, which is a massive basket of sweet potato and regular french fries with different dipping sauces.

Now, I'm from the Cornhusker state, and BELIEVE you me, I have had my fair share of sweet corn. So when I say that this was really some mad good sweet corn, you know I'm not just yanking your chain.

We had the pork belly during yelp eats.  That one was intense.  This one was even better!  And spicy from the Chile tepin.

I didn't think it could get better than the pork belly, but it did: Halibut.  It was perfectly cooked and had intense flavor. It was served over risotto that made my spine tingle with every bite!\n\nSecond Course Drink: Pineapple Coconut Frozen Margarita.  It was a lot like a pina colada.  Tasty.  Though large it went down fast!  I didn't feel it did anything for the Halibut the way the first drink did for the pork belly.\n\nThird Course: It seemed impossible, but the third course better yet again. Filet Mignon.  And they don't even have that on their menu.  It tasted peppery, buttery, spicy and just so atypically full of flavor!  And of course it was the perfect tenderness.  It was topped with crab that was so succulent I finally had to scoop it off and eat it as two succulent courses to enjoy everything they offered.\n\nThird Course Drink: A flight of three shots of Tequila: Silver, Reposado, Anejo.  The only difference: how long they sit in the barrel. 18 months for the anejo.  Three quick shots of tequila are always a great idea!

Rum after all that tequila wasn't the most exciting finale.

I am not a coffee fan, so I had to basically shoot this sucker down.  But everyone else seemed to really enjoy it.\n\nAbsolutely worth $85.\n\nAnd then the finale came.

The other dish that looked unbelievable was the Cinnamon Pecan Waffles topped with cinnamon helado. Oh my goodness...if I could have eaten two dishes, I would have definitely ordered those as well! They just looked tempting. For dessert we had the Espresso churros. The churros were okay...a little too crispy, they would have been better if they were served warmer and  if they were softer.

We were a party of 4. When we got there it was PACKED. Like bar-packed, not restaurant-packed. Good for them, seriously. The owner (we knew this because we caught his episode of House Hunters Intl) seemed to personally make it his \"mission\" to keep us happy while we waited. Way cool. Kept checking in with hostess on our behalf and comped our drinks while we waited in the awkwardly crowded bar/hostess stand area. This was all beyond the call of duty for most owners.\n\nSo what's the concern? It has obviously become a hotspot with the look-at-me crowd. Hungry, bedazzled cougars and Affliction-afflicted d-bags. And all of them were on the prowl. This is great for business and buzz initially, but it doesn't sustain you when that crowd moves on to the next hotspot. In the meantime, it's hard to become a regular patron for the food&drink when you've got that scene to battle with. On a weekend, even with a reservation, you're likely in for a wait with no good place to wait.\n\nAs others have stated, the place appears to be staffed up to the bejeezus. The amount of staff is exaggerated a bit by the shared service style. You probably feel like there are more servers than there really are because you seem to meet all of them! As The Mission inevitably transitions into a calmer, sustainable success, I imagine the frenzy of bar patrons and staff will calm a bit.\n\nAll in all, hoping they stay around long enough to transition from a 4-star hunting ground into a 5-star place for us to become regulars.\n\nOh, and the Churros.

We had lunch there yesterday since I wanted to try someplace new and I'd read good reviews. It's \"new Latin\" cuisine, brought to you by the people behind the successful Zinc Bistro, Matt Carter and Terri Ellisor.\n\n     The setting is lovely. It's housed in one of the outbuildings of the blindingly white old Mission Church in Old Town Scottsdale. You walk through an attractive fireplace'd patio and into the aroma of fire- grilled meats and romantic darkness (even at lunch). Unfortunately, you're assaulted by the background music which was very loud and distracting.  There's an interesting back-lit wall of orange and beige Himalayan salt blocks (actually I thought they were fake bricks until I read differently - gauche me). Lots of fancy chandeliers hang from the black ceiling, casting only a little light on the faux finished ochre walls and the somewhat crowded dark topped tables. Our server, Derek, added to the ambience - he was attractove, attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. Many of our south-of-the-border neighbors are represented on it: Mexico of course, Ecuador, Peru, Columbia, Venezuela, Uruguay, Cuba,and probably some I've missed. \n\n     I ordered a Cubano torta, one of my favorite grilled sandwiches with pork belly, smoked ham, swiss cheese, pickle, dijon and yucca ($12). The pork belly was meltingly tender.  Surprisingly, the torta did not come with a side, which struck me as pretty chintzy for the $12 price, but that was okay because I had to try the Creamy Grits ($8). Ken chose the Pabellon Arepas ($12). An arepa is a cross between a pancake and an english muffin. It's made out of a special pre-cooked corn meal, water and a little salt. First it's fried on a griddle, then it can be baked in the oven for a while where it rises a little and becomes less dense. It's then split, sometimes some of the interior is scooped out, and then it's filled with whatever delicacy strikes your fancy. In this case the arepa contained braised beef, peppers, black beans, cotija cheese, and fried plantains. So good. I spent an hour today googling arepas recipes and plan to go in search of the special corn meal tomorrow. The only disappointing (actually downright bad) thing on Ken's plate were the french fries, a mixture of white and sweet potatoes. They were supposed to have been sprinkled with lime and cumin, but they weren't, and also they were sadly limp. But OMG, the grits!!!! These were made with the addition of chipotle powder, butter, honey, and cotija cheese. They were on the spicy side, but the heat was moderated by the honey. The color was kind of a cross between pink and salmon (at least that's how it looked in the dim light), which made it even more interesting to eat. $8 for a good sized bowl which I proceeded to eat pretty much by myself as the grits were too spicy for everybody else (this was fortunate, because I really don't know if I would have been able to bring myself to share).\n\n     Our friend Ernest had a Skewered Grill Prawn Salad ($14), with arugula, yuzu vinaigrette, avocado, potato and orange sections. He said the prawns were nicely cooked but were somewhat too spicy for his taste. Anna ordered a chicken arepa ($12) with chorizo, corn, aji amarillo (the menu doesn't tell you, but this is a hot yellow chili pepper from South America - be warned), and Oaxaca cheese. While she didn't complain, I have the feeling she would have been happier without the pepper. The food here really isn't for the faint of heart (or heat). I don't know if the kitchen would be able or willing to tone it down for you, but it's worth asking.\n   \n     But the desserts won everybody over. We tried the Pumpkin Bread Pudding ($6), which is composed of pumpkin bread, creme brulee, a butterscotch sauce loaded with Scotch, pepitas, and topped with Berto's cinnamon gelato. To die for, not to mention get drunk on. The Fried Bananas ($7) were terrific, too, served with butter, nutmeg, peanuts, and a dollop of peanut butter mousse.\n\n     Go on line to see the dinner menu. It's expensive, most of the entrees are in the $20+ range, but they sound fabulous. The Mission is, for me, one of the most exciting restaurants I've been to in a long time, and I'm grateful for it.

I recommend the hot, as it's how I prepare my Guac at home. Mike the bartender is quickly gaining a following as a specialist in \"spicy\" margaritas, but make no mistake Mike is a true mixologist and takes his craft very seriously. Mike will usually have two frozen margaritas on tap at any given time and one version will usually be spicy. I've had the habanero, pear & ginger (yes that's right), watermelon and the spicy mango. All are awesome. Ask for a sample. Mike also has other cocktails and non frozen margs always on hand.\n\nThe chips and salsa are done in house the salsa is great and has a wonderful smokiness to it. If you want some additional dimension to your chips and salsa ask for the additional salsas that usually have on hand for the asking. It's worth asking for it as they are wonderfully prepared and add another flavor depth to your culinary experience.  However you will need ask specially for the ghost chilies salsa, and its hot, hot stuff comprade so please be careful. In India they use ghost chilies to keep elephants away if you catch my drift.\n\n I really love the Sunday afternoon pork taco all you can eat special. They roast a couple of pigs on property and serve until the pig is gone. The pork shoulder and the carnitas will rock your world with fresh made little corn tortillas.

You can also order the pork as entrees if you're not there Sunday or just want an entr\u00e9e; however the pork shoulder can't be beat as it explodes off the bone. \n\nI had the Almegas Al Vapor which is Peruvian seafood soup. This blew me away and wonderfully balanced with a light creamy broth and very unique flavors. The soup is not over powered by the seafood and the whole bowl is nicely done and makes for a great tasting dish just to expand your culinary diversity. The other side order I have to recommend is the street corn. The corn is sweet, wonderfully spiced and makes for a wonderful addition to any meal.

I am a guacamole fiend, and I would say it's the best I've had so far in Scottsdale.\n\nThat being said, I have to say the bad:  1.  Parking not great.  2.  When we showed up, they gave our table to another couple right in front of us, even though we had reservations.  3.  They had run out of menus, so we had to wait for them... for over 20 minutes.  4.  I was most looking forward to trying the Texas grits, and when they didn't show up, I asked our server about them, and he told me he was sorry, but they were out of them.  That's fine, but I wish he had told me sooner.\n\nHowever, again, the personality of the server was nice and accomodating, and the flavor of the food at The Mission is delicious.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Wonderful!

The margaritas alone are worth a trip to the Mission. \n\nThe front patio was very inviting and cozy with a fireplace as the centerpiece. Perfect for a balmy Arizona fall evening. \n\nYes, the food portions seem small, but the flavors are so full & rich that we were all full afterward. Salsa, freshly made guacamole, clam stew, skirt steak & chicken tacos, and pork belly fajitas were all amazing. The \"medium\" guacamole was a bit mild for my taste but very tasty. \n\nAll in all it was a party for the taste buds! \n\nService - it was a very busy Saturday night and they were packed, but they got us a table on the patio without a reservation within about 10 minutes. Our server was attentive and informative but not intrusive or over friendly. We were quite happy with the service. \n\nPrices - perhaps they are high, but for the quality and inventive flavors the prices are in line. This is not your neighborhood Mexican restaurant after all. For 5 of us with appetizer, meals and multiple generous drinks the total was $140. Not bad for a unique evening!\n\nParking - there's a huge lot just across the street and another parking garage right behind the restaurant.

Actually, I'd say the Mission serves the best meal in the greater Phoenix area with a simple and romantic flair. So much for adjectives, as there may not be enough to accurately describe this dining experience.\n\nFirst off, The Mission makes me want to \"re-calibrate\" my other Yelp reviews as this is truly a real 5 star place. \n\nWe are staying in a wonderful 5 star resort where the concierge suggested this dining spot, but also let us know (under full disclosure) that she is employed by The Mission as a bartender. She gave us 2 tips: \"You must try the Duck Empandas and the Peruvian Stew\". Peruvian stew is actually called \"Almejas Al Vapor\" and consists of peruvian clam stew + rock shrimp + chorizo + pan de yucca + aji amarillo + roast corn, and is a bit spicy. I thought this was an odd choice as it's 80 degrees outside dining on their lovely patio, but we tried both. \n\nThe Almejas Al Vapor is an incredible dish. Each bite reveals a new twist and many new flavors. Unbelievable call, and no, it doesn't make you seem warmer than normal. The Duck Carnitas Empanadas are excellent and are a bit cheesy. If you like white sauces and cheese, you'll love this dish. The dish consists of duck + foie gras + orange + habanero + oregano + mushroom + queso oaxaca baked in a homemade empanada shell. Honestly, I was trying to pace myself, so I only ate a few bites of an excellent small plate..\n\nOur excellent server had her favorite appetizer and insisted we try the \"lettuce wraps\", aka Crispy Cola Pork consisting of pork belly + cola + lime + chiltepin + peanut + pickled red onion wrapped in gem lettuce.\nThis dish is excellent and the lettuce cleverly is placed on the peanut sauce such that you only get every flavor if you eat by hand v with a fork. You'll have to try it to understand what I'm saying.\n\nAfter appetizers, I was forced to \"downsize\" the entree and we split the Steak Tacos. The story we'd heard about this place was the Chef who is famous for French Cuisine and created Zinc Bistro always wants a \"Taco stand\". This is far beyond a Taco stand, but you get the French influence and clever presentation, with Latin cuisine and perfect use of spices and sauces making the Mission unique. \n\nDessert time which means it's time to split the Fired Bananas. Generally, I skip dessert, but Fried Bananas is one of my favorite foods, and these are the best I have ever had. \n\nFirst, the presentation: The fried banana are actually placed in a cinamon tortilla shell. There's house-made peanut butter and Cinamon Gellato on the plate. This is all rounded off with a simple, elegant cinamon/sugar mixture (heated as a light sauce) with a few peanuts as garnish. Here's the menu's description: Fried Bananas butter + nutmeg + peanuts and dulche de leche.\n\nWe sat on the patio as our bartender suggested this was a quiet romantic spot...excellent call. There are two other dining areas, a front patio and the inside which has a large bar. Inside seemed loud and would be a good happy hour spot. The back patio was wonderful for romantic outdoor ambiance. \n\nLast, and not at all least, our service was wonderful.

This place is hands down my absolute favorite place in Scottsdale.  Great atmosphere, great drinks, great food, great servers, great owners, what more can you ask for??  I visited the Mission the first time for Valentine's Day dinner when my boyfriend took me based on Yelp reviews.  We weren't sure what exactly we were getting ourselves into, but we took advice from many reviewers for the pork shoulder tacos.  We ended up getting the chips and salsa, a cheese plate, the pork shoulder tacos, a side of chipotle grits and ended with the pumpkin bread pudding.  Needless to say we were stuffed, but extremely happy.  We went back last night to take some friends who recently moved to the area, and they left just as happy as we did the first time.  My boyfriend and I wanted to branch out and get something new, but we had the best meal the first time that we did a repeat for round 2, although we got the churros instead of the bread pudding which were delish.  Sometimes you remember something tasting perfectly, and then you get it again and it doesn't quite live up to your mind's expectations.  Well, the Mission know's what's up.  It was just as good, if not better, than last time.  There is a reason this place has so many reviews, it practically speaks for itself.  I would highly recommend the pork shoulder tacos, the chipotle grits (so money) and some type of dessert.  They have a great bartender too - I had the strawberry coconut mojito, and it was tasty.

Our waiter was this funny guy named Derek, who, at first I thought I wasn't going to like that much (I have an aversion to trendy scottsdale people) but turned out to be wonderful and make great suggestions all night! So thanks Derek!\n\nThe BF and I decided to order a few different small plates to get a feel for the restaurant. We ordered the cola crispy pork belly, the table side guac, the steak tacos, and a side of chipotle honey grits. I also got a Mission margarita. So my margarita comes out and it is really great! I have only had one other margarita that I liked equally. It was extremely fresh and it wasn't made out of that disgusting green sweet stuff that normally makes up margs. I would definitely recommend it (with salt). \n\nWe then get the chips and salsa. The salsa is really smokey and reminds me of the salsa at Abuelos, if you've ever tried that. I liked it a lot. So the man who makes the Guac came over and asked how spicy we wanted it, and we told him hot. He then proceeded to mix the guac using all fresh ingredients. It was so good! and so fresh! I liked how I could taste each flavor that went in, from the cilantro to the delicious tomato and jalapeno.... it was all good.... also, it had pinons on it, which gave it a cool texture. I have only had one better guac, and that is at Barrio cafe.... \n\nWe get the rest of the food, and the portions look tiny, but in reality, they are huge because I just ate half an avocado and a bagillion or so chips. The cola pork belly was Ah. Maze. Ing. I have never had anything like it. It's a crispy sweet and spicy pork with peanut sauce in a lettuce cup. It's like thai mexican fusion. It was the best of the meal. The steak tacos were also wonderful. The BF said it was like eating a new york strip in a taco. It was a little sweet and a little savory... all good. The grits were the only part that were just ok. I liked them, they were creamy and different, but I wouldn't get them again. \n\nSo we had to get dessert, as it was my 'birthday' and Derek recommended the pumpkin bread pudding. Holy crap Derek, you are the man! This thing was one of the most delicious desserts I have had, and definitely the best bread pudding. It's pumpkin bread with a little bit of creme brulee, in a sea of wonderful butterscotch sauce (made from real scotch...mind=blown) with the perfect amount of ice cream and little crunchy seeds for texture. Whoa. Just whoa. \n\nAll this, and the bill was like 65$... that's wonderful!

I have to try one of their margaritas.  \n\nHere is a rundown of the eats:\n\n*Chips = fresh and perfectly salted\n\n*Salsa = just eh - it had almost no spice and tasted too tomato pasty for me\n\n*Guacamole = phenomenal - they make it table side and you can make it exactly how you like it which in my case was with all the fixins' and spicy - it was awesome, just awesome\n\n* Poblano Grits = creamy and delicious\n\n* Street Corn = o-m-g - this was my favorite.  I could probably eat buckets of the stuff.  The sauce stuff they put on it is just amazing creamy spicy goodness.  Probably not too healthy though but it doesn't matter because it was fantastic.\n\n* Tacos (I tried the chicken, steak and squash) = very very good.  The only problem is that they were tiny.  They are literally 2 inches in diameter and at over 4 bucks a pop (you get 3) it kind of pissed me off.  I know it is more than enough food but it still angered me.  Anyway, each one I had was excellent.  The meat was perfectly flavored and juicy and all the ingredients on the taco worked well together.\n\nI also loved our waiter.  He was very friendly, funny and engaging.  He was so passionate about the place and its food it was almost as if he was the owner or had a stake in the place.\n\nEnough said.  I cannot wait to return.  I'm still pissed about the size and price of those tacos though.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 3, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "To be fair, the first time that I went to The Mission a couple of months ago, it was a 3-star experience.

I took my family for a Latin dining experience and was sadly disappointed.  Being an arepa lover, I was excited to partake in the experience with my loved ones.  When we arrived, we were told that arepas were no longer part of the menu, although they were still on the menu :-(  They are now serving the sandwiches that were served on arepas, on the torta bread.  The server was apologetic, but frankly, after driving 40 miles to get this specific menu item and checking the on-line menu before making the trip, I was not happy.\n\nThe pabellon filling was very good, but again, a let down without the arepa.  To add insult to injury, when the sandwiches were served, they did not bring Mission fries on the plate, because according to the bus boy, the menu changed when the sandwich was no longer served on the arepa, and it no longer was served with the fries.  The server quickly righted this issue and offered us fries on the house.\n\nThere are some high points to the experience: the setting is very pretty and the service is attentive.

Alfonso was our waiter, and he was awesome and didn't hesitate to make suggestions that we were happy to add to our dinner. First, the margaritas. ....this place knows how to pour, and they are fresh  - the only way we will drink them. Next - there are only 3 places in Phoenix that can make good table-side guacamole, and this is the best of them.

Both were excellent and may I say that the timing of each course was unbelievably prompt. We never waited and yet didn't feel rushed.\nDessert: I confess that I read the dessert menu first before making dinner decisions, and while other reviews loved the selections ...I wasn't blown away. The churros were small and dough-y, and the milkshake was just to heavy/sweet after a meal.....better to fill the churros with a cheese and serve them warm on dulce de leche ice cream. Fried bananas didn't excite me either. Bananas are bananas..... The pumpkin bread pudding seemed heavy and Autumn-like for a 110 degree day in Arizona and did not compliment the Latin flavors of the dinner.

Let me explain... \n\nI went to the Mission for the first time back at the beginning of July on a Sunday evening.  Upon entering, I was immediately enthralled with ambience of the place.  I loved the gothic yet romantic mood that was set by the decor and lighting.  The place was so packed on a Sunday night, that my boyfriend and I had to squeeze into a corner spot at the bar, not ideal seating, but that minor detail soon lost any importance once the friendly bartender began providing us with tasty and refreshing margaritas and extensive knowledge of the menu.  \n\nWe began our meal with the guacamole.  I like to think of myself as a guacamole snob, (I modestly claim to make some of the best guacamole around...) and the guacamole here is superb.  Not bland at all, full of flavor, and I love the additions of pepitas and cotija cheese sprinkled on top.  The salsa, how i typically judge a Mexican restaurant worth its salt, was super smoky and delicious, not at all watery.  Now, for the main event, the Duck Carnitas Empanadas.  My boyfriend and I both agreed that we had never in our lives tasted something so completely and originally delicious.  They were a revelation. \n\nNow, I suppose any restaurant would have a hard time living up to the hype and standards of such an outstanding first experience for two diners. With that being said, after having raved on and on about The Mission to fellow foodies and friends, my boyfriend and I took my bestie out to dinner so she could experience the food for herself.  The salsa paled in comparison to the batch we had devoured the first time.  The smoky flavor that we loved so much was simply no where to be found.  We ordered the duck empanadas with anticipation, knowing that there was no way these could disappoint.  Unfortunately, we were wrong.  They didn't excite me or my boyfriend the way they had the first time. We were both so giddy about savoring these genius pockets of poultry, but left feeling sorely disappointed. \n\nSo my point is this: the food is still delicious and inventive enough to give The Mission a try, but in my experience, it's just somewhat inconsistent.  Perhaps the chef who works on Sunday nights cooks with a little more love and patience.

Setting prejudices aside and deciding to let the food do the talking I was pleasantly surprised.  Full review with pictures is in my blog, highlight dishes are below:\n\nWith the kitchen moving surprisingly quickly despite (or perhaps because of) the late hour it would be perhaps fifteen minutes before our first course of the evening would arrive and although something I'd not have traditionally ordered the Almejas Al Vapor would prove to be well worth its \"best in the valley\" designation.  Described as Peruvian in origin and served in a large low-bowl along with dense \"pan de yucca\" bread with a good sponge for dipping this complex amalgam of spicy aji Amarillo chile powder, tender clam stew, rock shrimp, chorizo, roast corn, basil, garlic, and turmeric was everything its ingredients suggested and then some - hot and spicy, smoky and garlicky, sweet but saline, and all the while complex without being overwhelming.  While I personally could have stood for just a bit less salt and a touch more sweet to temper the spice this was a small quibble balanced nicely by the sweet rolls.\n\nFor the second of this round of appetizers my favorite plate of the meal would be presented as \"Duck Carnitas Empanada,\" an invariably upscale take on the traditional empanada with a golden flaky shell harboring orange glazed duck confit and an admixture of habaneros, mushrooms, cilantro, and queso Oaxaca.  Delectable on its own but certainly open to further adornment the empanada was subsequently topped with a chunk of seared foie gras and finally with a foie fortified queso Oaxaca pan sauce and a drizzle of tamarind oil with the end result sweet, savory, and totally decadent.\n\nLeft with a bit more time to digest and a lot less noise as the restaurant's population had literally dwindled by half a mere forty-five minutes after we were seated the final savory of the evening would arrive just after 11pm and as I was doing the ordering it just so happened to be a second round of my favorite fowl, this time the \"Green Chile Duck Confit.\"  Ample in portion and more so in flavor this pile of two legs and two thighs featured a whole lot of duck for the dollar but unfortunately was just a bit less crispy than one would have hoped - a small quibble as it was not greasy, but not \"textbook\" confit by any means.  Again spicy without being \"hot\" the duck subsequently topped with sultana serrano peanut mole and paired on the plate with savory \"cheesy fried hominy\" that tasted something like a cross between popcorn and corn nuts plus smoked mushrooms to help ground the rest of the flavors.\n\nFor dessert The Mission's Pumpkin Bread Pudding with Scotch, Caramel, Pepitas, Pomeganate, and Chipotle seasonings was quite outstanding.  Beginning first with the pudding, almost a steamed sticky pudding in texture, the flavor of the pumpkin, cinnamon, and clove was present in spades and the scotch tones blended nicely with the sweet caramel giving it all a heavy handed boozy bite.  With a touch of spice from the chipotle cooled by quickly melting dulce de leche ice cream I additionally found a lot of appeal in the pumpkin seeds and pomegranate with their respective salty and sweet crunch adding some texture.\n\nA modest tab, particularly when split, we opted to divide the bill down the middle and with that we made our way to the streets where, as I'd been told, few people were to be found at 11:30pm even on a Saturday.  Saying our goodbyes I made my way to my car satisfied with my meal at the Mission and realizing that perhaps my bias against \"scene restaurants\" was a bit unfounded, much like my preconceptions about \"Southwest cuisine\" - a fitting conclusion to my first trip to Arizona and a bit of reassurance that I could undoubtedly live here.  Sure the city shuts down early but to be completely honest by the time we left The Mission it was already nearly 2 hours after my typical bedtime anyway.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 3, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "This place is fabulous!

First impression when walking through the door is that it was a bit loud. But it being a Friday night we were necessarily surprised. Had made reservations and were nearly immediately seated with wait staff being very attentive even with all the chaos around. The decor is quite stunning. While humble from the outside, the inside is modern and classy. They also have an outdoor area with heat lamps and blankets for those who do not mind the frigid Scottsdale weather. \n\nWe noticed some of the tables around us just ordering drinks and a few appetizers as their entrees, kind of tapas-like, rather than ordering from the A La Plancha (grilled on metal plate) versus the A La Parilla (from the bbq or hot coal) part of the menu. It seemed almost obligatory that most diners ordered the table-side made guacamole. And it appears that to get chips and salsa you have to order the guacamole. My wife and I really did not come to The Mission to eat chips and guacamole so we decided to pass. Also it seemed a bit steep in price at $12, though diners around us seemed to be enjoying it. \n\nIn regards to the food and drinks menu, items are a bit pricey, but in retrospect on our meal I feel it was rather reasonable. The drink prices probably could use a small bump down, but being in Downtown Scottsdale I feel overpriced drinks are the norm (unfortunately). My wife and I ordered a couple Margaritas. I had the classic Mission and she had the Blood Orange. We followed up by ordering the Mini Chicken Tostadas and the Pork Belly Pibil as our appetizer. The Tostadas were a bit small but packed with flavor. The Pork Belly Pibil, however, stole my heart. A fairly sizeable chunk of pork belly slow roasted and served with pickled onions atop and a avocado cream and banana habenero aioli. The cream and aioli complimented the fatty pork belly, which I could literally eat as my meal alone. Probably one of the best Pork Belly dishes I have had. If you like fatty pork, you must order this. \n\nWe continued our unhealthy eating habits by ordering the Chorizo Porchetta and the Creekstone Filet. Filet was cooked well at medium-rare with proper seasoning and nice accompanying sauce on the plate. The Chorizo Porchetta nearly sent me into palpitations. They took pork and stuffed chorizo in it. It sounds grotesque, but it tasted incredible, albeit a little overwhelming as we had just had pork belly and steak. \n\nThrowing caution to the wind, we finished with the Espresso Churros, which is served with a milkshake. It was a perfect dessert to share between us. We managed to finish everything but we both found ourselves completely full afterwards. \n\nThe waitstaff was attentive, providing us with complimentary tastes of frozen watermelon margaritas between our appetizer and main course. We never had to find them or ask for more water which was again was a pleasant surprise given how busy it actually was. After all the food and drinks we ended up with a bill about $110 between the two of us, which I think is pretty reasonable for the food, drink and dining experience. I think you could possibly get away with the bill being considerably less, as we did order a bit too much food. Also the drinks we ordered were alone around $30. (Side note: they also have pork shoulder tacos, which is actually for two. Its about $32 total and according to the waiter you get a large slow roasted pork shoulder, and unlimited tortillas and sides to make tacos. It reminded me of the family style pork dish at Momofuku in NYC. Definitely will be trying this in the future.)

This is one of those meals that made me think about the process of creating the food. Man, I wish I knew how to perfectly peel the skin of a little tomato without crushing the tomatoes or how do I take the bitterness of uncooked kale into a salad that has a myriad of wonderful textures and flavor. I really really appreciated the bitter chewy bits of the blood orange because by itself would have made me upset but paired with the rest of the salad, the combo just worked.  Did I mention I really like this salad?\n\nThe Mahi Mahi Taco was interesting.

Their tortas remind me more of something you would find at a wildflower except without any good mixture of ingredients. you would think that if you only served 5 different things you would be really good. I don't mind a small amount of choices, even if you think of your own home rotation of meals you cook for your family you could limit it to your top 5 things and have a menu that would kick the crap out of most restaurant menus I am sure. I had the brisket torta which seemed to be a mix of a lox and a thin(super thin) layer of burnt beef. My girlfriend thought the same. My friend had another one that looked better but she said she wouldn't rush to come back for it. The side of beans were ok and the chorizo and potatoes were ok more for the potato side as the chorizo was semi bland and couldn't hold a candle to any Shreiner's offering.\n\nSo we had a 90$ lunch (no alcohol) that had faux latin food.

Crab and corn pancakes reminded us of the crab salad at zinc bistro and find out later both are owned by the same person! Win win!  Lots of fresh crab on top of corn pancakes!  The street corn was amazing!!!  We asked the server to cut it off the husk and it was made with some sort of sauce that had a huge kick!!! It was crunchy and sweet and then spicy from the sauce!

My wife got an wonderful drink that paired with the house guacamole and the braised pork belly perfectly.

Topped with caramelized onions, perfectly spiced, just the right balance of crisp on top and unctuous in the middle.  The appetizers were so incredible we decided to keep going.  The ambience was wonderful, the crowd was sociable and we ordered the Peruvian clam stew, the duck confit and the sweet potato fries....oh, almost forgot the braised beef street tacos.  The portions were all huge, and it was clear that we had ordered too much, but we shared with the folks around us.  The street tacos were good, topped with a crisp slaw and fresh homemade bread and butter pickles.  I would say they were just what we expected.  The duck was excellent, and more than enough for my wife and I to split...and we still couldn't finish it all.  The fries were great....and good fries should never be taken for granted.  But, the dish that trumped them all was the clam stew.   The spicy brown broth was light...almost airy, and its all about the broth.  The stew was just spicy enough, without being overpowering.

But, judging on how they pack them in, the investors who own The Mission, could easily raise prices by 10 or 20%, and no one would blink an eye.\n\nHopefully, you're not reading my Yelp Reviews for Economics lessons.

Yes, it's very good.  They cut up one avocado, add a pinch of salt, red onion, half a lime, cilantro, pine nuts and some grated mexican cheese. Creamy texture and yummy.\n\nWe ordered a glass of Sangria for $8.00. and a Mohito for $12.00.  Both were very good, though each had too much ice.  We also ordered off the appetizers menu the Chicken Anticuchos for $8.00, and Skirt Steak tacos for $12.00. \n\nThe chicken comes on two skewers, with a very nice tasting mole that dominates.  It's seasoned with raisin, balsamic, sesame ,cocoa and peanuts.  Very nice.  The three small steak tacos were marinated in Tecate and smoked in their back yard. It's the smokey taste that makes the dish unique.  It also comes with green chili salsa, some diced avocado, cilantro and cotija on top.

It is the perfect taco - has a balance of flavors, and if you are like me (a carnivore) the ratio of more meat to tortilla is perfect, the salty crumbly cotija and creaminess of the avocado set off the flavorful deliciously tender skirt steak perfectly.

So fresh and had the perfect consistency and loaded up with red onions, jalape\u00f1os, tomato, garlic, sea salt, lime and topped off with cotija and pepitas.

But, it was my boyfriends 21st birthday, and he'd been talking about going here for a while. Knowing that they had a pretty good drink selection, I decided to take him.\n\nThe place is smack in the middle of Downtown/Old Town Scottsdale, so be sure to arrive a bit early and be able to walk a little ways, because they don't have their own private lot (it's all street parking). Anyhow, the outside is very plain and simple- like an actual Spanish missionary-type building. Despite the simplicity to the exterior, the interior is so much more lavish. So much up-scale decor and style, I was blow away! \n\nAnyhow, we sat down and had the most pleasant and nice waitress that we've had in a while at any dining experience. She had short blonde hair and was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and seemed to genuinely care. She took our drink orders and was so nice about it being my boyfriends birthday! After checking ID, she brought us the blood orange margarita and the watermelon mojito. According to the boyfriend, both drinks were really good and really strong-- I guess that's a good thing considering the drinks are pretty pricey- $12-14 a piece. \n\nAnyhow, when she came back we ordered the tableside guacamole to start. Awesome concept, you get you add in exactly what you want, you get to determine how spicy you want it (we got the hot version) and you get to watch it being made! Aside from the interesting concept, the guacamole itself was SO good. I really haven't had fresh guac like that ever. The only downside is that the portion is a tad small for $12. \n\nOur waitress came back in a timely fashion, and took the time to explain the menu in detail to us. We ended up ordering the barbacoa tacos and the crispy rock shrimp tacos. The wait for the food was short, and when they came out I was amazed. I have NEVER, EVER, EVER eaten a taco that mind-bogglingly delicious. How it works for the tacos is you get three tiny little housemade tortillas that come with heaps of meat or shrimp or whatever you decide on top- kind of like an open-faced sandwich concept. Anyhow, the rock shrimp were my favorite. The shrimp were cooked to crispy perfection, but not overly-battered. The shrimp tasted fresh and juicy, and the cabbage and such that came with it was delicious as well. Make sure to squeeze some fresh lime on top for an extra kick! My boyfriend ordered the barbacoa tacos, and they were honestly amazing as well. I've really never eaten meat that tender in my life. It was super flavorful and melt in your mouth delicious! \n\nOnce we finished, we waited a bit for our plates to get cleared, but to our surprise our waitress brought us a sparkler with a complimentary dessert for my boyfriends birthday. The dessert was a warm pumpkin bread pudding with a scoop of ice cream, and gosh was it delicious. I would most definitely recommend it. The service got pretty slow toward the end of our meal, but honestly it didn't really deter too much from the great food. \n\nThe bill came- around $80, but I was so willing to pay the price for a great meal and good service (FINALLY)!

I watched him open up the avocado and add pine nuts, cilantro, etc., and then he mashed it all together.  When I took my first bite, then I quickly realized I should have taken a video of making the guac.  It was amazing, and now I have no idea how to recreate it.  (I'm sure I couldn't anyway, but it's fun to think about.)  The all-important consistency was on point.  It was not chunky, but there were still enough chunks of avocado to remind you that the guac was homemade rather as opposed to the creamy, Cool Whip-like texture of guac from a mix.  The guac was awesome--the pine nuts, cilantro, and other juices and spices were perfect.\n\nPumpkin Bread\nI'm not a pumpkin bread connoisseur by any stretch, but I would confidently challenge any other restaurant's pumpkin bread pudding to hang with The Mission's.  The baked edges, caramel sauce, and ice crea made me yearn for more.  If only I hadn't filled up on the chips and guac!

The Mission's outdoor area accommodated around 4-6 tables of our group of over 20 plus as well as other guests not with our party. There was a fire burning in the hearth, probably perfect for when the nights become a little chillier. The owner greeted us by presenting us with a shot of Tequila apparently made by George Clooney (hello!?) and instead of a lime and salt, there was an orange with brown sugar. This is what they call, \"mission style.\" Tequila is my enemy, but I sipped the shot and it was very smooth. I mostly ate the orange slice that I assume if I liked tequila would be a great innovative way to shoot it!\n\nWhile most of our group opted for margs, I went rogue and ordered the red Sangria (though they have white as well) and it was perfect to pair with their chipotle salsa. Though I'm more of a pico de gallo/limey salsa girl, this one wasn't overly smokey. I have to say their table side guacamole was one of the best I've had. I love me some fresh guac, and if I could've had it for myself or had them make a bath tub of it, that would've rocked my world. \n\nThe first menu item was a petite pork app. Two of our table guests didn't eat pork, and our waiter, Tony, and the owner quickly brought them out other options. The app was a great crunchy texture and various levels of flavor. This was followed by a shaved kale salad. I am a sauce/dressing junkie, so I could've had more of the dressing, but I understand what they were going for. Then we were presented with three adorable tacos; one pork, one steak and one chicken. The steak was Tecate Skirt Steak, and if you know me you know I love me some Tecate, so that was definitely my favorite with the pork being very similar to the app and the chicken one, probably coming in second place. I would most definitely go back for another round of the steak tacos. \n\nThe service, again, was amazing.

Their menu is pretty thick but it's mostly the cover that's thick, and there aren't actually a lot of pages, so focus on the tacos.

The patio is really pleasant...well-shaded, and with plenty of cover to prevent...er...birdy accidents (I normally avoid dining al fresco, having lost many a tasty meal to a sparrow's incontinence, but this patio was sheltered enough that it seemed -- and, thankfully, was -- safe!).\n\nNeither of us wanted anything heavy (we were still a bit full from a wonderful pizza at Papago Brewing the night before, and anticipating a big dinner at Caf\u00e9 Lalibela in Tempe that evening).

If you've never tried (or thought about) grilling lettuce, you're really missing something! Grilling brings out the sweetness in this often rather bland vegetable, and adds a nice smokiness that was, in this salad, perfectly complemented by the chipotle vinaigrette. Everything was in perfect balance, with a slight saltiness added by the cotija cheese, a kiss of heat from the chipotles, and textural contrasts provided by the black beans and the thin tortilla strips. It was generously sized too...perfect for a light lunch.\n\nThe corn was, in a word, amazing. My serving consisted of nearly an entire ear of corn, served as two skewers, each bathed in a luscious chili-laced butter sauce and lightly coated with more cotija cheese. Yum!\n\nMy husband's tacos were very good as well. They were served as three mini-tacos, each on a small, handmade tortilla. The proportion of filling to tortilla made them something you'd want to eat with a fork (like a small, not-fried, tostada) rather than try to pick up.

The wine came a long while later. We put in an order for a jidori chicken appetizer with a server and some guac made table side. Both were good. For dinner we ordered the diver scallops and another chicken item. Right after one server took our order for entrees, another came up and dropped off dessert menus. What...? Did we not get our entree order in? We will never be sure when the entree orders were put in. Did the server forget? Why did we get dessert menus? It took almost an hour for entrees to come out. Which was fine as the appetizers filled us up. But still. Both entrees were good but I've had comparable food with proper service at other places. My scallops were perfect although I realized I wasn't a big fan of the set it was with. Boyfriend liked his chicken. We were planning to get dessert but after all was said and done I was full and completely turned off by the service. Our bill was somewhere around $130 before tip. I've worked fine dining, I'm still a server. This was the worst service I've ever had, not because the people weren't nice but because it was so chaotic and stressful and the energy was reflected onto the guests. Def not worth $160, which is a lot to us. Lastly, I forgot my sweater there and didn't realize until we got home. I called the restaurant and the host said they had it. I gave them my name and number and said I would be in the following day. I went to pick it up the next morning and it was no where to be found. Kind of ridiculous if you ask me. Save your money.

They roll out a cart filled with every ingredient imaginable to create guac and literally make guacamole right at your table to your taste. It doesn't get any fresher or better than that.

There are three separate interior dining spaces, along with a small patio, which creates a warm vibe and reduces the bustle and sound levels, creating an intimate setting. The owner Pavle is very welcoming and is a superb host. For a quick weekend in Scottsdale we sat outside for an early afternoon bottle of wine and a cheese & fruit plate, which was off menu but Pavle said \"leave it to me to put something together\" and he delivered. We also took his recommendation for wine, with a Lynch Aligote and both were wonderful. We decided to return for a dinner the following evening, as the menu and wine list read so well. Putting ourselves in Pavle's hands, we had a bottle of champagne from Savoie and a Etna red, both great and well priced. He could have chosen something for $100, and we had a larger budget, but his picks were half that and it is a testament to his ability to deliver consistent value and a high quality experience for his patrons.

Wonderful varied flavors, from the lamb dumplings, falafel plate, pasta, and then to chicken...and I'm writing from memory so I will be general, the cuisine we tried (about 25% of the menu) is a hybrid of \"classic\" Mediterranean (falafel, lamb...) but with Italian \"peasant\" influences (brothy with vegetables), light and flavorful, not heavy, with a \"Grandma's kitchen\" feel where the plating is home-y, large portions, not served with a \"reverence\" you might find at a fancy foodie restaurant. Definitely a warm welcoming feel, where food is more dionysian. Notable: the chicken is sourced from a small farm, we had a breast that was pounded thin, had a wonderful gameier taste and texture, served with a topping best described as a dry salsa, with halves of lightly cooked radish, with wonderful croutons of lightly fried polenta. Fabulous. Highly recommend you visit (& make reservations!...also note he bar has only 3 seats, but Pavle is very accomodating and will work with you).

Really problematic for our party, as we were looking forward to splitting their fabulous french fries.  There was a rather dismissive apology by the waitress, then she advised us that any of the entrees that would normally require a fryer could be prepared as grilled. I really couldn't think of what that was on the menu, but I ended up ordering a couple of \"safe\" appetizers to split, and left disappointed. We also ordered chips and guacamole, and the chips were either from another establishment or yesterday's as they were stale and uninviting.  Not what you would want to pair with $12 tableside guac.   It was even more entertaining to watch the very large touristy family next to us who wandered in with 7 kids under the age of 12.  There was nada on the menu for these little ones to eat except a quesadilla I guess.  After they ordered, their waiter came back to their table to let them know that their whiny kids would be ordering something else besides french fries and empanadas.

The Duck Carnita Empanada and the Pazole.  When my wife got the empanada, she immediately realized there  was no way she could eat that then an entree after it.  It was a very large portion and rich/heavy.  I didn't mind that so we switched and she took the pazole.  After a few spoonfuls she told me it was very salty.  I was surprised because we are salt fiends and never complain about saltiness.  I took a few spoons and yes, it was extremely salty.  Inedible salty.  If you have ever had Kalua pork at a luau, you would know that it is very salty, but in a pleasant way.  This was way more salty than that.  We told the server and he immediately said they would take it off the bill.  Considering the reputation, I would have thought they would offer a free drink or desert, but that is ok.  Anyway, my empanada was good, just very filling, and unfortunately I ordered the Duck Confit for dinner, so double rich duck dishes.  My wife got the snapper which  was extremely good and made up for the salty pazole.  I was relieved.  I thought maybe we hit a place that was all hype, but no, this place is legit and very good. They just probably had one of those moments where someone in the kitchen didn't taste before sending out the dish.  I will never hold that against a restaurant the first time.\n\nWe were too full for desert, so that was it.  The place was super busy, hip, and dimly lit, which we like.  Service was very good.  Dammit though, I was really looking forward to my 2nd ever bowl of Pazole.  My first was while visiting AZ last year and I had been craving it since.\n\nWe will be going back to The Mission as it has a very interesting menu that deserves investigating further.

Ever go to a place and just feel uncomfortable?\n\nFirst, there were 6 to 8 employees huddled in and around the small bar area.  Because there were few customers, they spent their time loudly discussing what they did the night before, what they were planning for that night, that one time in Vegas when they got into a VIP room, etc.   Folks walking by on the street are not going to come into your empy bar if the staff is all huddled in a circle talking.  Sorry.\n\nIt was almost comic watching one of the waiters sit at the bar and send text messages while the two hostesses took turns bringing him orders from his tables, debit cards from his tables, telling him he had new tables, etc..  Everytime he got up there was a look of annoyance on his face like his 6 customers were taking up too much of his time.  And why is the staff allowed to sit at the bar on shift???  Is it a break room or a bar?\n\nI'm pretty sure the other group of people at the bar were friends of the bartenders and waitstaff.  They got a lot of attention, the staff even sat down next to them to talk.  If you want to focus your business on the bartenders' friends, and not the \"outsiders\" at your bar, you are going to have a tough time making your mortgage payments.  I'm guessing 3 months until there is some more available retail space in SoSco.\n\nI give two stars because as I said, the food was surprisingly good, and one of the six barstaffers was a friendly guy.

For some reason, yesterday there was another rvw with a 1star, which is now missing????\n\nanyhow, We also saw many of the staff standing around together and chatting.  We found the whole vibe to emit very strange & weird \"somethings-just-not-right\" kinda thing,  and just overall we too were uncomfortable - no Zen aspect whatsoever.  It didn't help matters at all that our bartender did not have on his hospitality hat.  I found him condescending & arrogant, not friendly and frankly fairly rude.  \n\nThere is an extensive martini list, which, with all the advertising I had heard & read about, seemed to have been a draw for me to check it out.  They all use different ingredients & tend to lean towards sweet (grenadine, curacao, ect.  BLECK).  OK, so that is just my opinion, I know (I like em crisp n clean).  So I was interested  in the new vodka names which were unfamiliar to me.  \n\n1 drink had lychee in it, so I inquired, \"was that a lychee infused vodka?\"   (many of their martinis do not indicate the base: vodka, tequila, gin??).  \n\nThe reply was a taunt \"Lychee is a Chinese fruit\".\n\n  \"Um, ok, yes I know what it is, I eat them all the time, they have a red shell and white inside.  My question was, is that the vodka?\"  \n\nAnother terse reply, \"well, I infuse it myself, it's a spirit.\".  \n\nOK, this is not going well.  \n\nSo I ask about another concoction, I think it was made with Primavera Vanilla? (Or  brand which began with \"P\") \n\n So I asked \"was that a vodka?\"  \n\nOnce again he basically avoided answering by saying something irritating like, well there's 4 different flavors, or you can get it plain.  I'm like ? ! ? ! ? ! ?  \n\n I was nowhere nearer to being educated on their very confusing ingredients. \n\n I thought the way to get around it was to ask for vodka straight up.  I saw they had Effen Black Cherry (totally awesome infused vodka, btw).  That's pretty simple, correct me if im wrong?  But he stands there, with an idiot face, and i felt the vibe of he wanted to argue with me and couldn't believe he has to lower himself to do this task?\n\nNow, again, I'll point out, this was a very simple task: \ngrab the vodka bottle, \npour it into a shaker with lots of ice, \nshake it, \npour it, \nserve it.  \nThis couldn't possibly go wrong, right?  \nGuess what? \n It arrives and I sip it - well for some unknown reason he took it upon himself to add water, yes, water it down!  Nice!!  This is really irritating me, because not only was mine watered down, (who does that?!) so was hubby's  tini with way too much soda.  Yes the description indicated a splash of soda, but I would guess it was 50% of the 4oz pour - unacceptable.\n\nI should also point out that I too saw the bartender & servers chat incessantly with, what appeared to be the manager - but this \"employee\", of some sort, was initially drinking beer at the bar, but would get up and go behind the bar to help himself to items.  WTH?  Either you are working or you are not.  Pick which one and stick to it.  He made no secret that he was associated with the establishment, as he engaged another table in discussion as to the up-coming specials and  hours and menu changes.\n\nIn closing, I have to say this is in a great location, and I was really looking forward to visiting - I had such high hopes!

It took forever to get drinks first of all. While I realize that martinis do take longer, the majority of the people at our table just had standard mixed drinks of beer. After we ordered our meals, it took probably about an hour for our food to come out, and mind you the place was about 50% full if I'm being generous.  The thing that made it even more irritating was the open kitchen, where we saw our plates of food sitting out on the counter for a minimum of fifteen minutes before being brought out. I assume it's because they wanted all of our meals in a party of 9 to come out at once. Well, by the time my husbands plate actually made it to our table everything was completely cold, he ended up sending it back actually. I ordered the bruschetta--great concept but not executed well at all, the bread was completely soft and turned into mush. The toppings were okay, certainly didn't wow me. Another friend ordered the same dish, which by the way isn't cooked yet she was the absolute last one at our table to receive her food, a good twenty minutes after everyone else. \n\nAnyways like some other people had mentioned, the vibe is just a bit 'off' and we couldn't' put our finger on it. My friend said it was like everyone was \"playing restaurant\" --didn't really know how to handle the various parties and certainly didn't care to be efficient or accommodating by any means. It seemed like people were just sitting around doing nothing... and by the way, if you're going to be that inefficient as a kitchen maybe you don't make it a demonstration kitchen so people can't see all of their meals sitting up on a counter for 15 minutes!

The portion was so large that it could easily have made an entree.  The texture was great, the cheese creamy and flavorful - but too spicy for my sensitive tastebuds.  Not overwhelming, but definitely A-Ok for its $9 price.\n\nFor the main course we had the Mojito Chimichurri - which was carne asada, caramelized onions and mushrooms, and seasoned fries.  For $22, this was a very disappointing selection, despite the generous portion.  The meat was extremely dry and chewy, though the garlic (and mojito?) marinade had given it a wonderful flavor.  The fries were not seasoned, and were completely lacking in flavor - so they had to be dipped in the remoulade that came with the plantains.  Not much to say about the onions and mushrooms.  This dish was worth about $8.95.  If I had ordred Carne Asada at Chipotle it would have been ten times better and cost a fourth of what this did.\n\nAlthough the menu offers selections such as \"Arroz con Pollo\" and the \"Tabla Latina\" (Ropa Vieja(marinated shredded beef)/ Yuca/ Fried Plantains/ Fresh Avocado/ Aioli Sauce/ Corn on the Cob/ Side of Black Beans & Rice), as well as well as a \"Santa Fe Fettucini Alfredo,\" there was nothing about this menu that made it unique - aside from the plantains.  When I saw the name \"Latin Fusion\" I was expecting something unmatched.

The waitress says she is going to talk to the manager. Now, obviously, the other table wants to talk. Asked if it was a roach. We said yes and they informed us that is why they had moved, they had two on their first table. (Why they were still eating must be a testament to some tasty food though!)

We meet up with our waitress in the breezeway on her cell phone with the manager??  Now there is staff taking tables out of the restaurant and into the bar. He/She is telling her to shut down the dining room. We told her we had to leave and go somewhere else for dinner. Gave her a tip for her service and left.

Guanaquito had a far greater variety of pupusas than Elaina's, and they were every bit as good. The one that I had that was most unique was made with cheese and loroco plant (which to me had an asparagus-y taste). Definitely delicious. At both Salvadoran places, we were served a bowl of cabbage salad, but at Eliana's we had never been told how to eat it. Guanaquito's was far less astringent and we were instructed to eat it with our pupusas. I was skeptical at first, but became quickly hooked.

At first I was a little apprehensive, the area sucks and the parking lot was empty but it was a Saturday and probably between the lunch and dinner rush. In fact, by the time we were ready to leave, the place had filled up. The actual restaurant was very minimalist but clean and welcoming on the inside. The only negative I have to report (other than the neighborhood) is the language barrier and lack of service. Don't get me wrong, the server was very sweet and accommodating but there was only one, she didn't understand what we were saying most of the time, and it was hard to flag her down once it started to get busy. Only one of us had any experience with this genre of food, and although he liked Guanaquito, he said he preferred Eliana's but mostly because he said they spoke English and had a slightly better papusa. This was my first so I had nothing to compare it to, but I have to say I was very pleased. We ordered 3 plato tipico which came with papusas (we opted for all bean and cheese after reading the other Yelp reviews), a Salvadorean version of an empenada filled with meat and potatoes, yucca frita, tamales, and some slaw.

We also had a side of fried plantains that were accompanied by crema fresca and beans (AWESOME!), their complimentary chips and salsa, and my kids shared the spaghetti with ablondigas.

We had a couple die hard favorites back in SoCal that we would frequent on a monthly basis. We've been missing our Cuban craving fix since moving here to Phoenix. So last Friday evening as we were deciding where to get our grub on we happened to pass by Havana Cafe. The fianc\u00e9 had heard good things about this place from coworkers so we decided to bust a U turn and give it a try. \n\nIt is located in a small strip mall with a metal gate door. A little sketch looking but we weren't deterred because good food often comes from little dives. The place was pretty busy but we were seated right away. It was a little weird for us to be seated side by side on a bench which the hostess first had to slide the table forward, allowing us access to the bench, and then proceeded to slide the table back in towards us so we were essentially boxed in. But moving on....The place is loud with great live music but you find yourself having to talk really loud to your server to get your order in. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 ordered his usual favorite: ropa vieja. I couldn't really find anything that looked especially appealing to me...for a reasonable price at least. So I settled on a tamal cubano and the ceviche from the appetizer menu. Overall, the food was good. We enjoyed the ropa vieja and the ceviche. I only wished that the ceviche came with chips instead of crackers. The tamale was good and had bits of pork in it which made it more of a crowd pleaser for the fianc\u00e9. However, both of us felt that we didn't enjoy our meals as much as we do at our fave Cuban place back home. Plus, we didn't feel our meals were worth the prices here so we left a little unsatisfied. Don't get me wrong...we are not opposed to spending good money on food that we feel is worth it so please note that our review is not because we're cheapskates or anything. But if you plan on hitting this place up then be prepared to pay $20 and up per entree. \n\nBottom line is that we may or may not go back.

The sauce served with the plantains was too watery to hold up to the dense starchiness of the plantains so we ordered a side of their homemade banana-guava ketchup. That was delicious and did the trick. They ended up not having one of the advertised Yelp Eats entrees. I thought that was pretty poor form--if they are running a special for a week they should not run out. I ended up ordering fried pork morsels from the full price menu. The pork was so dry that I could barely swallow it, even after dipping it in the sauce. There was no changing the fact that it was simply deep-fried pork chunks--not worth the $21 price tag. I sent the dish back and when I didn't want to order something else off the menu we were reminded that that fine print states that you are not allowed to split Yelp Eats discounted entrees, as if we had planned to send back the full-price dish. After that, we were ignored by the wait staff. The dish we split (bistec cubano) was good, so I can't complain, but wouldn't have been worth it at full price.

Had to ask for the Yelp Eats menu (oddity #1 as all the other restaurants I've visited since the start of it all had hosts/servers deliver them w/ the YE menu on the very top of the pile), and when the host handed it over, I noticed a sticker that asked not to share dishes- oddity #2.  As I waited for Linda to arrive, I ordered a mojito ($7.50) and asked server Ana about certain dishes, and she demonstrated great knowledge of both food and beverage menus (kudos to Ana!).  The wonderful mojito (dark rum, fresh lime, muddled mint, sugar, and a \"splash of soda\") arrived just as L. arrived, and, having had their mojitos in the past, she also ordered one for herself.  (If you do not come to dine here, you should at least try their mojito... probably the best I've ever tried, besides the ones I've made!  Not very sweet, the rum not overpower, but still a potent cocktail.)  \n\nAfter a little chat, we placed our order (split checks) for the Bistec Encevollado (steak w/ onions, for me) and the Frituras de Frijoles Negros (black bean fritters w/ avocado dip, for her).  Despite my preface of \"I'm going to skip on the apps and order an entree, because I want to have dessert later,\" Ana asked me AT LEAST two times \"And what would you like for an appetizer?\"  She even pointed to the app portion of the menu the second time, and again I said I was only going to order the entree as I'd wanted to leave room for dessert.  L. was going to start w/ an app first and see if she was going to order more later.  Again, Ana asked what she'd like for an entree, and when Ana left, we already felt like we were being treated rudely and pressured to order more.  (L. eventually ordered another app, and then a dessert.)  App and steak arrived together, and for the record, I offered L. a taste of the wonderful steak, and she turned it down, bec. she tries not to eat too much red meat, but she did try the Papas de la Casa (spicy homestyle potatoes) and found them very salty.  I described the side dish as \"highly-seasoned.\"  Yes, they were very salty, and I hadn't noticed they were spicy, but Mom did when she tried a little bit at home.  L. tried to share her fritters w/ me, but I've already tried them before, and I wanted to concentrate on the steak.  It was a \"good\" thing that Ana had pressured L. to order a second dish, bec. she actually ended up liking the Frituras de Camarones (three crispy shrimp pancakes served w/ a Romesco sauce).  (Hey!  I was correct when I thought the sauce looked like it was thickened w/ some sort of nuts... friend described it having a flavor she couldn't put a finger on, aside from the pepperiness and acidity... it also contained almonds and sherry.)  I very much enjoyed the Bistec encevollado and would not hesitate to order it again!\n\nAna had asked a couple of times if I was ready to order dessert, but I decided to wait for L. to finish eating.  I was still enjoying my mojito and was even contemplating on having another.  (Actually, I was stalling for time since I couldn't decide whether I was going to order the chocolate bread pudding w/ homemade dark fudge rum sauce, or the lime pie!)  Finally, I decided to order, and I chose the bread pudding and asked L. if she'd get the lime pie, and she said yes.  Score!  While I enjoyed both desserts (I'd had two \"tastes\" of the pie before I asked for one \"to-go\"), I favored the pie.  That night, however, I couldn't get enough of the fudge rum sauce!!  I tell ya, I don't know what I WOULDN'T do to have another chance at savoring this fudge sauce again.  ;)  As far as the lime pie is concerned, I don't know how Linda could sit there and watch me take three swipes off of her pie... I think I was only able to restrain myself from having more, bec. I knew I'd have another one to enjoy at home!  Oh yeah, take the bread pudding (but leave the rum sauce!), and I'll have the lime pie every time from now on!\n\nWe plan on visiting again, esp. on Mojito Mondays ($3 mojitos all day), and we hope that the rudeness was only due to Yelp Eats Week (although there really isn't an excuse for the rudeness!), bec. it would be a shame to have to skip this HC location-- L. said that this location is less noisy than that on Camelback.  I probably should not have tipped 20% off of the original cost of the my bill (original would've been $40.50, plus tax, and w/ the YE discount, a total of $27, w/ tax), since she was so rude to us, but I didn't want her to think that Yelpers were cheapskates.  \n\np.s.

On our first visit, we sat at the bar and had some mojitos and tapas.  The mojitos were some of the better ones that I've found in the Valley and all three of the tapas items had great flavor and as the bartender explained, were homemade with fresh ingredients.\n\nWe were excited to come back and try out some of the entrees for dinner and returned about a week later.  There were only three other tables that were occupied, yet we were seated along the front \"window\" which is a sun-warped dingy looking sheet of some sort of plastic rather than glass.  Needless to say, this did not add any ambiance to our meal.  I ordered a cup of black bean soup and the Cho Cho, which is described on the menu as \"Fresh Chayote squash stuffed with lentils, corn, carrots and onions. Topped with a Jamaican Curry cream sauce. Served with white rice and a spicy green tomato chutney.\"  My husband ordered a cup of the zucchini soup that was a daily special and the Berenjena con Garbanzo described as \"Grilled purple eggplant stuffed with chickpeas, fresh tomatoes, onions, Manchego and Parmesan cheeses and thyme. Served with fresh asparagus, on a bed of white rice and topped with a creamy sherry tomato sauce.\"  We waited at least 15 minutes for the two cups of soup to make their way out. My black bean soup was excellent and I would certainly order it again.  My husband's zucchini soup was also very flavorful.  Before we were even done with our soups, a waiter brought out our entrees and tried to remove our soups while we were still eating them.  We told him that we'd like to finish the soups first so he just set our entrees alongside each of us and walked away, leaving our empty drink glasses on the table without asking if we'd like another round of drinks.  \n\nWhen I finished my soup and moved my entree in front of me, I could tell that we should have stuck to the tapas that we'd had last time.  It actually looked like someone had thrown up in my plate.  The squash certainly weren't stuffed, but rather, there were a couple pieces of squash found beneath a pile of carrots, red peppers, and onions with a yellow, gelatinous sauce poured over the top on a huge pile of white rice.  The veggies themselves would have been edible if not for the strange sauce that had been applied.  It had only the slightest hint of a curry flavoring and had a texture that seemed to indicate that it had been thickened with cornstarch.  I tried the rather flavorless chutney served on the side only to discover the same cornstarchy texture.  Now, I certainly would not knock a restaurant for making an authentic dish that I just don't happen to care for, so if this is how this dish was supposed to turn out, then those who prefer this presentation would probably enjoy it, but I really couldn't manage to eat more than a few bites before deciding to call it a loss and order something else.  My husband's entree, while better than mine, was also less than exciting and tasted to me like a very bland version of eggplant parmigiana.  He liked his well enough to continue eating (this may have had something to do with the fact that we were both starving when we came in). \n\nNow here is where the service really goes downhill.  For the next 30 minutes, no one came by to find out how the food was or ask if we'd like drinks.  In fact, we didn't even see any of the three wait staff even enter the dining room.  Finally, when my husband finished his meal, the waiter came over and asked if I'd like my entree boxed up, to which I replied \"no, but I'd like to see a menu to order something else.\"  He promptly brought over a dessert menu so I then had to explain that the reason my entree was still in its entirety on my plate is because I didn't care for it and would like to order something to eat for dinner.  He brought back a menu, dropped it on the table and waited while I decided to order the Tortilla Espanola.  He then quickly darted away before we even had a chance to order drinks.  Having sat there for at least 40 minutes with empty glasses, I finally got up from the table, walked into the bar, and placed the empty glasses on the bar.  The two waitresses who were sitting at a table in the bar area chatting apologized for the wait and said that they'd have drinks right out. About ten minutes later our drinks appeared along with my Tortilla Espanola which was as delicious as when I'd had it during our prior visit.  The waiter did take my entree off of our bill, but in my opinion, the poor service that we got in a nearly empty restaurant is inexcusable.

Havana Cafe used to be one of the few restaurants I used to brag about to out-of-town friends.  They had a dozen dishes that I would classify as excellent and many others that were just \"quite good\".  But it has gone drastically downhill.  Here are a few examples:\n\n1.  The appetizer portions are smaller than they used to be, sometimes ridiculously so.  For example, the chicken croquettes ($6) consisted of two pieces the size and shape of a thumb (a child's thumb), filled with pureed chicken and almost entirely tasteless.\n\n2.  The entrees (we had ropa viejo and picadillo) were adequate in size but spiced very poorly.  The picadillo had no tropical spicing, and in fact tasted faintly bitter.  The ropa viejo was vinegary.  This points to incompetence in the cooking staff.\n\n3.  The prices remain high.  But they are cutting corners -- no bread was served with the meal this time, for example.\n\n4.  The menu was never really authentic Cuban, but it did have a number of popular Cuban dishes, with an interesting admixture of Central and South American favorites.  Some are still on the menu, but others have given way to meat loaf and fried chicken.\n\nIt looks to me like the management of Havana Cafe is flopping around, looking for a way to make money (or more money) and has made a series of poor decisions.  If you are listening:  it's time to hire a better chef, make the menu more authentic, get rid of those $5 plastic chairs, provide real value, and pay more attention to managing the wait staff.

Last night I went to Havana Cafe. When we entered the restaurant the hostess approached us and asked us if we had a reservation. We told her we did not and she said that they were booked up but we could eat in the bar. There were at least 6 tables open. It wasn't our first choice, but we said okay. We sat in the bar and the waitress took our drink order. After about 20 minutes the bar tender asked if our orders had been taken. We said no and he asked if he could get an appetizer started for us. We ordered our appetizers and waited for the waitress to come take our dinner order. While we waited, some other people came in and we heard them say that a 10-15 minute wait for a table was not too long. We asked them if they had a reservation and they said no, they just came in. A couple at the table next to us said they too had been told they couldn't eat in the dining room. While my friend went tell the waitress that we wanted a table, a waiter came to the table with 2 appetizers. He tried to give me the wrong one and I told him that the other one was ours. He walked away with both appetizers. I and someone at the table next mine tried to call him back but he kept going. The waitress finally came to take our orders. The appetizer waiter again came by with our appetizer and walked past our table twice. The waitress had to stop him and tell him to give it to us. We were finally moved to a table and waited for our food. When the food finally came, they brought all of the food at the same time, instead of bringing my friends salad before the entree. Also, my salad was nothing like what was listed on the menu and had ingredients that I am allergic to. I told the waiter that this was not the entree salad that I ordered and that I was allergic to some of the ingredients. At this point we asked to speak with the manager. After 10 minutes of watching the manager come in and out of the dining room, going around to talk to people at other tables we asked for the manager again. Our entrees were brought out to us. They brought the exact same salad to me and my friend's entree had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp. The waiter said that he would get the menu so he could show me that it was the right salad. The manager still hadn't come to us so my friend went to him. From across  the room, I could see from his body language that the manager was not in any way responsive to our issues. When my friend returned to the table, she told me that he was rude to her, until she mentioned that she knew the owner. The manager then came to our table. When we brought up the fact that my salad was nothing like anything on the menu and the fact that when we told the waiter that I was allergic to some of the unlisted ingredients, he apologized and said that sometimes the chef changes the ingredients and the menu isn't changed. I explained that this could be life threatening for some people.  He offered to have the salad remade, but at this point I was not confident in their care for allergy issues and declined.

Our media guests were treated to a muddling class, ceviche instruction and tasting as well as a delightful dinner and dessert.\n\ndeseo is located on the lobby level of the resort offering an enticing menu created by James Beard award winning Chef Douglas Rodriguez, regarded as the inventor of Nuevo Latino Cuisine.\n\nUpon arrival, we were escorted to the Muddle Bar.  The room is warm and dark, offering up a relaxing atmosphere largely due to the rich, warm wood.\n\nWe were presented with the Grande Mojito.\n\nOur instructor and mixologist, Monique Dias, was so enthusiastic and full of information regarding all facets of muddling.  It was not only an enjoyable experience, but an interesting history lesson of sorts.  Tasty too!\n\nWe were able to sample the Grande as well as the Berry Grande Mojitos.  While both were delicious and I rather enjoyed the introduction of fruit, I am partial to the original version.\n\nAfter our Muddling Course was complete we were lead to \"the rail\".  The Rail overlooks the open kitchen.  I have to say, if given a choice of dining at a table in the main room or at The Rail, I would always choose the rail.  I couldn't imagine all the things you would be able to see on a busy night, not to mention the tips one could pick up just by being in the presence of these amazing chefs!  Chef Rodriguez treated us to an in-depth lesson in all things ceviche.  I was amazed at the amount of information that he knew and shared with us.  (I won't spill it all, since I really want you to check out deseo and The Rail and have your experience not be tainted by mine!)\n\nOur first indulgence was the Rainbow Ceviche, a beautifully presented dish featuring tuna, salmon and hamachi dressed with white soy, citrus, sesame seeds and pickled jalapeno.  In short - it was amazing and my hands-down favorite of the three ceviches of the night.  It was so fresh and light and the slight punch of the pickled jalapenos was unexpected yet welcomed.\n\nNext up we had the Lobster Escabeche which was a delicate ceviche served with avocado, chives, sweet aji and garlic chips.  This is not what you think of when you hear \"ceviche\".  It was delicate yet rich.  Beautifully presented and a treat to my mouth!\n\nWe completed the trio with the Ceviche Mixto Clasico, full of lobster, shrimp, scallops, calamari, octopus, crab, red onion and an accompaniment of sweet potato.  What a decadent way to round out the tasting.\n\nPrior to being served our entrees, Chef Rodriguez spread some holiday cheer by treating all of our guests to a personalized autographed copy of his most recent book, The Great Ceviche Book, revised. This book will provide you a bounty of information and instruction as well as hints and tips to create an array of ceviches!  This was such a wonderful treat to our guests and we were blown away by his generosity.\n\nAfter we calmed down from the excitement, is was time for our entrees.  We were served a split plate of tender beef tenderloin and merluza sea bass and fideo.  The contrast of flavors and textures of these two dishes was complex and only lent to the entire experience of the evening.\n\nOverall - this event, having been our first to co-host - will be close to impossible to beat.

The fish was very fresh but the citrus juice was way too tart and overpowering. The kobe flatbread was served on a 5 inch disk with truffle aioli and arugula. The lighting in the restaurant was dim so after my wife had a bite of the flatbread her face went from excitement to a rather unpleasant frown.

Before Deseo my all time favorite was the Maine brook trout served at Arrows in Ogunquit, ME. On the way out I asked the chef if indeed the sea bass was poached in butter first and he replied no.

I wanted the lamb but fish seemed better that late. It was cooked perfect, covered in an intriguing sauce with just enough heat to be interesting. He side was a collection of chopped up veggies with angel hair pasta. It was even better than the fish. Each bite was a slightly different experience. It all worked well together. \n\nFor desert I had Berries on some flan. It was just as good, not too sweet, and the flan had the right consistency. \n\nWe took our time and let the car charge for about an hour and 20 minutes, more than enough to get home. \n\nI can't wait to come back with the wife and have a full meal.

The entrance is a short walk from the front of the Westin.  You enter through a side door, then go down a candle lit staircase to the hostess stand.  The hostess is as pleasant as can be, and there is an artist working on some pieces, which was interesting to watch for the minute or two we waited for someone to take us to our table.  I also am fascinated by the bar set up around the open kitchen.  I always find it interesting to watch they way high class restaurants prepare food (unless you end you seeing something nasty).  Deseo's set up is very sleek and modern.\n\nWe started with a round of Mojitos.  I had berry, my girlfriend had nectar.  The berry was okay after I made the effort to crush up the fresh fruit and mint with my straw.  I hate to sound lazy, but you'd think that's something the bartender would've done.  The nectar was much better.  For our meals we had the beef tenderloin and lamb.  The beef tenderloin was said to be churrasco style.  That usually means flat and charred with a chimichurri sauce.  This steak was big and fat, and the sauce was barely there.  It was a good Beef tenderloin and cooked perfectly to medium, but it wasn't anything amazing.  There also was a sauce on the plate that was very powerfully vinegary, which was a little odd.  The lamb itself was excellent, but it also had a very oily sauce on the plate that I didn't care for.  For dessert, we had the chocolate cigar.  This was cool just in presentation, alone.  A thin small cake, rolled like a cigar, with a white chocolate and hazelnut filling.  It also had a coffee gelato served along side.  I also want to mention the awesome rolls.  The bread was made from some sort of white corn and served with a garlic butter.  If more were brought to the table I would've eaten all of them.  Although I found it odd that the rolls came just seconds before our meal.  I guess the bread guy was on break.\n\nThe food was good.  But as I've said, none of it had that wow factor I was hoping for.  The bill for this meal came to $115.  Not crazy expensive, but just high enough to leave me desiring more from the kitchen staff.  I used a $60 for $30 gift certificate from localdines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485) which knocked a good portion of that cost off of the check.  overall, Deseo is wonderful place to dine.

It just made more sense to try out this new place in the valley and I was happy for the decision :)\n\nUpon arrival to the restaurant, we took a spot at the self-parking and took a small walk into the resort and it was so worth it, you can feel the quietness and relaxation! The restaurant is at the lower level of the main lobby, we opted to walk down the stairway instead of taking the elevator. Reservation was confirmed with the host and we were taken to our table, very modern and contemporary design, with Latin American music in the air, very romantic if that is the occasion.  And we were not surprised there were only a few tables, I bet everyone else  was in front of their TV watching the super bowl.\n\nNow it's food!\n\nTwo appetizers - we were recommended by the waiter to have a warm dish and a cold dish, and our choices took the Millionaire Taco and the Squash Blossom Tetilla Quesadilla. Both were very tasty as well as nicely presented, especially the tacos! They were so cute at looking and so delicious at taste! Mixed lobster, ahi tuna and hamachi meat with a chipotle mayo-ish sauce scooped into a small crunchy yuca chip, hmmm, can i have some more? The quesadilla was warm and the cheese was just melting, it's not the typical tortilla you would have, not sure what it is called, but this ones were thinner and attracted a bit of more oil...\n\nTwo entrees - \n+Pan seared Mahi Mahi on top of a light broth with some shrimps, shaved calamari and some peas, it also came with a spoonful of freshly grained chili pepper and amarath for some extra spiciness. The dish looked very healthy and pretty with different colors, tasty yet I couldn't say a lot about the freshness of the fish, or the other tastes just stole the fish. \n+'Kobe vaca encebollada' - grilled kobe skirt steak with a strong tomato based sauce on the top, paired with some purple potato with egg and guacamole. The sauce has a mixture flavor of sweet and spicy, and also a little sour? It's definitely not how you eat your typical steak, but be a bit adventurous and see what you think? \n\n-Two desserts - We felt like this was the final show and you see it! The chocolate cigar and the flan (?) with some fresh berries. They even made a couple of little matches with the cigar! and of course they are all edible! The 'cigar' was made of dark chocolate and very rich, paired with some coffee/caramel ice cream was just heavenly!\n\nOverall our dining experience was a joy. Our waiter was nice and attentive, also knowledgeable about what came to our table. All of the food were delicious with nice presentations, we can't say if these are your authentic Latin food as we are no pro.

No real crust and wrapping then in zucchini only made them mushy. However I have to respect the quality of the actual ingredient and they were a pair of meaty and juicy scallops!

Instead, we sopped it up as best we could with the delicious yucca flour rolls.  That was the only \"low-point\" in the service---we asked for extra rolls and the server was disgruntled and almost tossed the rolls on our plates.  And those yucca flour rolls are so exceptionally, incredibly good.  If I knew where to get yucca flour, I swear I would try to make them at home, if I was any sort of baker.  Just beyond delicious!  So don't be stingy!   We started with the Rainbow Ceviche, which I think has Ahi and Calamari and Salmon with a touch of jalapeno and a sprinkle of black and white sesame seeds, so it is as beautiful as it tastes.  DH ordered the Kobe Vaca Encebollada, which was a grilled skirt steak and I ordered the Yuca-Wrapped Dorado al Ajillo.

He said the flavors were so wonderful though, and he thought it was just the nature of the cut of meat, and that next time if he ordered beef he would go with the tenderloin or else try the pork or chicken. The potatoes were so delicious, he wished for a larger portion.  My fish dish was incredibly tasty, beautifully browned to a crisp finish, albeit the tiniest bit overcooked.  And I have had gloriously browned fish that was perfectly moist and tender, so I just think it was a tiny misstep by the kitchen. The amaranth that came with it was so unusual and delicious---I can't even describe it except---yum!  I wanted more than the soup spoon (it literally came on a soup spoon!) quantity they gave you.  There were tiny flaws in execution, but overall flavor and presentation was wonderful, so I have to give it four stars because we are totally fans and totally going to be back.  We didn't order desert but the after-dinner coffee rocked though---wow!  I was bright and bushy-tailed after one cup despite a big meal and several glasses of wine!  We don't care for the South American wines too much, but it is a South American-themed restaurant, so it is what it is, and after a couple of glasses, who cares?  Our server Jason was very good---attentive without stalking. The service at Deseo is top-notch.  If it hadn't been for the bread guy being kind of surly when we asked for a bit more bread---oh, and then when we were trying to get every bit of the delicious ceviche juice (is that what it is called?) he kept trying to take the dish from us, even while we were dunking our bread bits into the sauce!  Go away!  (Actually, it's a good thing he did eventually carry the dish off, or we may ended up just drinking the juice from the plate---yes---that good!)\n\nAll in all, another very lovely experience and we will totally return every month or so, just for the ceviche!  Actually, DH---the man who HATES fish---said he wouldn't mind just coming in for a dinner of ceviche and yucca rolls!  (Who are you and what have you done with my real husband?)  I felt the prices very reasonable---actually, less than an Italian restaurant (disappointing!) we went to last night and a million times better in all aspects---taste, service, and ambiance.

I felt like we received substandard service because they knew we had booked with the Groupon and that they already knew we wouldn't be spending a large amount of money. Our waiter was not very attentive to us and I was really disappointed when I finished my cocktail during appetizers and he never asked if I wanted another, let only did I have a chance to ask as other people cleared our plates and brought our other dishes throughout service.  In fact, they brought my husband the wrong entree and then he had to wait about 5 minutes before they brought the correct one.

Great choice...This gave us the chance to chat up the chef and his team about what they were doing and what they were making long before we had to make the terribly difficult choice of what to order.  In slow moments, they were great company and when they were busy, it was a very artistic demonstration of culinary prowess!\n\nBut I should back up...on arrival it was suggested that we try the muddle bar for a cocktail which turned out to be a great decision, their happy hour selection of mojitos was equal parts affordable and decadent!  We had the nectar and the berry mojitos and on round two the bartender sent us off to dinner with a hybrid champagne and muddled berry mojito that was to die for!\n\nOur three course meal consisted of millionaire tacos...that lived up to the name!  Then we shared our main courses of kobe beef and mahi prepared with contemporary central american flair...awesome.  Then we tried the desserts that rocked equally.  The Mrs. was celebrating a birthday so they subbed in a chocolate cigar with candied matchsticks that was super cute and tasty.  \n\nBig shout out to awesome servers Jeff and Giovanni and to Chef Roberto and his assistant Esteban....these guys made the meal twice as enjoyable as it already was.

Since it was a weekday night, it naturally wasn't too busy, with only a few patrons here for dinner.\n\nWe had a Groupon, and redeemed a 3 course meal. Despite this being an evanescent deal, the restaurant had the choices for the 3 course menu printed out and posted on a one-page, hard-backed menu like it was a regular menu- very nice touch! \n\nWe started with the millionaire tacos and ceviche. The millionaire tacos were superb, filled with fresh seafood, with a variety of textures and flavors running through the appetizer. I especially enjoyed the use of yuca chips as the shell for the tortilla. The ceviche was good as well, with spicy piquant flavors and a masterfully done presentation, but the added textural component of the millionaire tacos made me a bigger fan of this dish.\n\nFor entrees, we had the kobe vaca encebollada (Skirt steak), and yuca-\u00adwrapped  dorado al ajillo (Mahi-mahi and shrimp with garlic sauce). The kobe beef was very tender, and a complex mix of flavors. The blue potatoes that went with it were stunning, both in flavor and in presentation. The seafood dish was excellent as well, from the crispy crusted mahi-mahi to the tender shrimp swimming in a saffron colored citrus-garlic sauce. I particularly enjoyed the use of toasted amaranth to add an extra textural crunch and nutty taste. \n\nTo further gild the lily, we ended our meal with dessert, sharing the crema\n catalana and the chocolate cigar. The crema catalana was an interesting blend of flan and cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e (It is in fact the Catalan version of cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e). The creaminess of the custard meshed well with the berries and whipped cream, and there was a light topping of candied peeled ginger on top. The chocolate cigar was pure indulgence, and I loved the unique presentation. The cigar was wrapped with a \"Deseo\" paper ring, and they even made candy matches and a coffee mousse dessert to go with it.\n\nUnlike other restaurants where Groupon patrons are treated like they are the scum of the earth, service was impeccable and we were treated just like regular paying customers.\n\nIf you have the coin to spend on a good meal, or if you are feeling like splurging and going to somewhere nice, this is definitely a good place to go!

She suggested a place near my office, and I found The Corn Flower using my Yelp mobile app.  It was showing 4.5 stars and a menu that sounded delicious.  We were on our way.  Before I get too far into this review, let me just say that we met both the cashier and the Executive Chef and they were both wonderfully warm and genuinely nice people.  I could tell that the Chef cared very much for her product and was very excited to hear that I would be reviewing her restaurant - in fact, she made sure to ask me to.  So here goes.\n\nThis is a very small dining room located at the end of a strip mall on the corner of Tatum and Greenway.  We had some difficulty finding it.  You walk in and it's like walking in to a retail store, not a restaurant.  There were enough tables and seats for about eight people, all decorated very nicely with paper flowers, and pictures.  One wall contained a huge glass-fronted refrigerator that was filled with various sized packages of their signature item, empanadas.  The menu is written on a chalk board above the cashiers counter.  While it is very clean and well-appointed, it did not give off a restaurant vibe, but rather a store.  The Corn Flower bills itself as \"Fine Casual Mexican Cuisine\" and seems to be more of a catering establishment trying to be a storefront trying to be a restaurant.  Unfortunately, for me it does not succeed at being a sit-down restaurant.\n\nWe ordered from the chalkboard menu, I had three Carnitas street tacos and a ground-beef empanada and the wife had corn-chowder soup with chips.  We both opted out of the canned soda's from the display case and instead asked for Iced Tea.  The cashier/waitress described it as an Arnold Palmer, which was fine with both of us, however, it tasted like instant.  The cashier/waitress grabbed a packaged empanada from the display case and took it back to the kitchen.  After a few minutes my street tacos arrived, arranged nicely on a long narrow tray, garnished with chopped green onion and a salsa.  It was okay.  Next, my empanada arrived, a single empanada on large, round plate, no garnish, no dipping sauce or anything.  It was warm and tasty, but the filling was dry.  Finally, my wife's corn chowder arrived.  It was a large bowl filled with about six ounces of creamy, undistinguished soup.  No garnish.  She asked for chips that should have arrived with it.  The cashier/waitress brought the chips on another large plate.  Wife asked for a spoon.  Meanwhile, we stole napkins from another table.  The soup did taste like corn.  Kind of like creamed corn.  Not bad, but not delicious either, actually kinda bland. And not much of it for $8.  Some add-ins would be nice, like chunks of avocado and diced chiles - especially for the price. \n  \nOverall, the food was not bad, but there was nothing that really wowed me, or made me want to come back for more.  Presentation was lacking and service needs to be honed.  I'm not one to tell a chef how to run her business, but it's prolly not a good idea to grab a diner's meal from a display case in front of them.  Maybe you should have some product in the kitchen.  It wouldn't hurt to serve the Empanada's with some sort of sauce as well - perhaps a fresh guacamole or salsa, and smaller portions dictate smaller serving containers.  Chips can and should be served in a basket, not a plate, and again, should have some sort of dipping sauce to go with.  Same thing for the Taco's.

Delicious!\n\nThe tortilla soup was not good, in my opinion.  It was simply broth, whole tortilla chips (which were hard to eat/cut in a soup) and what seemed to be store-bought guacamole.  The broth was good, but they'd be a lot better off if they skipped the guac, and just added a slice of lime, fresh avocado, and maybe some cilantro.\n\nThe hardest part about the visit was the service.  While the server was super sweet, she was obviously overwhelmed, as she was the only one servicing tables at lunch time.  They were out of a lot of things in their cooler (iced tea, specific kinds of tamales and empanadas), and they made the soup on the spot.  Some might see the soup thing as great service, but soup can be made at the start of each day and be just as good.

They had a nice presentation but I wish they had long, waist high coolers instead, similar to a salad bar.\n\nThe man behind the counter was a bit cold at first. He seemed to warm up and become friendlier by the end of our transaction but I was uncomfortable at first. Also he charged me per empanada instead of by the dozen price listed on the menu. Not that big of a price difference but still kinda ticked me off. I didn't say anything because I had a Groupon and was already getting a good deal but you can bet that if I return I will rectify that situation.\n\nWhen it came to heating the empanadas we were clueless. There weren't any directions that came with them, or on the menu, or on their website. So we heated them in the oven until they seemed warmed through. I think it was a mistake because pastry was a bit tough, dry and not as flaky as I expected it to be.\n\nThe Hawaiian pork was the favorite with my husband and son. My husband wished there was filling in the empanandas. I had vegetarian ones. I wasn't crazy about the spinach one but I did like the potato one.\n\nA little later we heated up our dessert ones. This time we microwaved them. The texture of the pastry was much better this way. We will keep it in mind if we return.\n\nThe chocolate and lemon ones were delicious and melted in our mouth. \n\nMy general feeling is that the empanadas are a bit overpriced for what they are.
