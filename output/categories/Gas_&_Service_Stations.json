This new prototype they is even better than the old awesome locations. This new location has plenty of parking in the front and on the sides with front and side entrances as well so you're always near a door. They split the drinks up on two sides with tea snd coffee on one side and sodas and frozen drinks on the other with fresh prepared foods in the middle. Unlike the old locations, this one also has a smoothie bar where they make fresh drinks or ice cream treats for you as well as pretzels made to order and more pastries and donuts than I've seen before. And of course they have the standard QT quick checkout, never anyone waiting more than a few seconds. Seriously it's amzing to watch on of those guys to ring up three people at once.

Admit that I am addicted to the energy drink, Rooster Booster, that they keep on tap?  \n\nThe thing that really separates QT from other gas stations is their delightful array of slushi drinks. They have more flavors than Circle K and Seven Eleven combined. I like to use a slushi drink in replace of ice...so, white cherry slushi + coke = cherry coke.  You can get crazy with it, add watermelon to Sprite, and pina colada to Rooster Booster.  You can try doing this at Seven Eleven, with their sub-par slushies, but I can guarantee you that the dude behind the register will stare you down until you break into a cold sweat, and three video cameras will zoom in on your every move.  If you want slushy at Seven Eleven, you must pay for slushi!\n\nBut not at Quick Trip...they invite you to mix their slushies with your soda.  Their commercials even encourage it.  THANK YOU QUICK TRIP, for challenging my creativity and ingenuity.\n\nSo now that I provided that crucial background information, it is time to reveal what makes this particular QT so particularly amazing.\n\nAre you ready?\n\nTHEY HAVE 22 FLAVORS OF SLUSHI.\n\nThere are three different blue flavors, eight red/pink flavors and multiple neon flavors.\nThey even have a sugar-free flavor, so if your digestive track can handle sugar-free stuff, you can drink these every day and call it a diet.  WINNING!\n\nAnd if your slushi-soda combination creates a reaction and your cup overflows, do not fear...according to the QT worker today, \"it happens all the time.\"  And that is probably why he appeared out of thin air before I even realized that my cup was combusting.  He came with paper towels, a smile, and a floor cleaning machine. You just have to love a place that never has sticky floors.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 2, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "Somehow in the midst of my excitement over the abnormally high number of slushy flavors, every time I go to this QT gas station, I somehow overlooked the thing in the middle.  IT IS A WHIPPED TOPPING MACHINE.  Who would ever expect a whipped topping machine in the middle of a wall of slushies? I almost thought I was dreaming. \n\nOn the machine it says, \"Add whipped topping to your favorite frozen or hot drink.\"  \n\nI assume that since the machine is smack dab in the middle of the wall of slush, that \"favorite frozen drink\" refers to slushy.  I never thought that I would see the day that putting whipped topping on a slushy would not only be deemed appropriate, but even be encouraged. This QT gas station is clearly one (or 100) steps ahead of the game and I hope that all other QTs (and circle Ks and 7Elevens) follow their lead. \n\nSo, the curious reader is probably wondering, \"how does whipped topping on a slushy taste?\"   Let me just say: why eat a popsicle when you can eat a creamsicle?\nI  now realize that a slushy without whipped topping is like a cake without icing or a raisin without chocolate.  \n\nThe machine is a little loud, do not let this scare you.  It also is a little slow, so you must be patient as you wait for your whipped topping to drop.\n\nAside from the screen that says \"Push Here for Whipped Topping,\" there are no instructions, but do practice caution when mixing the whipped topping on soda.  Yes, you can put it in soda...it's not as weird as it sounds, think of rootbeer floats, or the more obvious, cream soda.  Unfortunately, the whipped topping seems to trigger a volcanic effect when added to soda so make sure you leave a good 2-3 inches in your cup to prepare yourself.  Even if you quickly put a lid on it, the increased carbonation will fizz right through the straw hole.  My husband foolishly waited in the car for me while I ran in to buy (aka \"create\") his fountain drink and unbeknownst to him, I added whipped topping, which continued to fizz through the straw hole for quite some time.   If this does happen to you, just try to not make any sharp turns while you drive.
