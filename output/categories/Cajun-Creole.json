I find most places take on authentic Cajun cooking to be nothing but a stereotype of heat and Raggin Cajun's accents. The true taste of the food is lost in hell peppers and fire sauce. Flavors of Louisiana offers something that is vastly superior to this concept, authenticity. Cajun cooking (like most southern area's) is all about taking your time when you cook and not rushing it like most places. The restaurant is a little small nook that is easy to miss unless you are looking for it. \n\nI decided to order the Shrimp Po-Boy and some fries. While I was waiting, the owner was making her rounds talking to the tables and welcoming them, and asking if they needed anything. My food came up quickly and I was out in a dash.

First off to be fair to other so called Cajun places in the valley while you are quite good, nothing compare to true Louisiana Cajun and boy that's what this is.  \n\nTo start this is literally a mom and daughter joint!  They opened last year and are starting to get quite the following.  The location is a bit tricky but take the ten to dysart road make a right at Rancho Santa Fe and go into the parking lot of LA fitness and Walmart.  The restaurant is located right in front of the LA fitness.  We made the mistake of going to the other side of the road as most people do.  \n\nInside the decor is quite simple chairs tables, condiment table with forks hot sauce and napkins the typical.  One side of the wall is dedicated to Louisiana State football so if your a Louisiana state football fan you are in good company.  \n\nThe food is very good priced.  I started with the gumbo which had all types of seafood as well as rice and an absolutely fabulous broth.  It has to be the best gumbo in town.  They don't put okra in it which kind of takes away the traditional gumbo taste but the cook told me that they do that because a lot of people don't like the okra around here.   I loved it all the same.  Today was the special gumbo and it had fresh oysters in it.  Melt in your mouth Gumbo!\n\nFor my main dish I had the catfish, craw-fish and the red beans and rice.  The catfish and craw-fish were both spicy seasoned not spicy hot.  Which helps with not to take away the flavor of the meat.  I was stunned at how both of these fish had no fishy taste to them at all.  It was as if they were caught on the bayou and served to me minutes after the big catch.   The catfish was specially good.  It had a homade cornmeal crust fried to perfection and not goopy take away the flavor fried but perfectly lightly fried.   The craw fish were fried in an absolutely melt in your mouth buttery salty spicy batter again not to over bearing.  The fried stuff comes with some special tarter that is oh so tasty.  The red beans and rice will make you wanting more.  The texture is right on and the flavor is that southern spicy mouth watering rich red beans and rice like mom used to make.  They are addicting.  My girl got the catfish and dirty rice.  Again if you love dirty rice and I mean in a traditional way this is right on the money.  \n\nOverall I think I found a new eat out place.  It is well worth the money and the staff , flavor, and tradition of eating in a place like this makes me wonder how I can bring my self to eat at a chain.

I generally use both - but the lack of okra didn't detract from the perfect balance this gumbo was!\nA coworker commented to me several weeks ago the gumbo was too \"soupy.\"  Not sure what his gripe was here...every bowl of gumbo I enjoyed in NOLA was just this texture.\nHappily, my sister lives nearby - so now that I have been, I will be back again and again!\n\n(Note to Miss Jennifer - I will be in on Saturday to enjoy a beignet!

They used a great balance of corn meal to flour (slightly more corn meal, making it crispier and trapping the juiciness inside better). They knew what I meant when I said \"make it dressed with hot sauce.\" The bread almost tasted fried, but it is the best French bread this side of the Mississippi River.

I wasn't crazy about their rendition of chicken and sausage gumbo, as it wasn't dark enough, but the seafood gumbo was very good. They diced up the holy trinity (celery, onion, bell pepper) to appropriate sizes.\nA word of warning; the sweet tea is done too sweet for some Southerners and definitely too sweet for most in Phoenix.

Second, the sweet tea was delicious. I love that it was brewed tea not the typical fountain nestea kind filled with artifical flavor. Since Javier and I both dont drink sodas finding a good beverage alternative is always a plus. Ok and now for the bad, and I really hate to do this because I really wanted to like this place alot. Im picky in the kind of seafood I eat, so I asked the cashier what kind of seafood in the gumbo. Given that I was in there on a Friday during Lent this was the only kind available. They had told me only shrimp and crab, perfect since those are two kinds of seafood I actually like. So when we get our order the gumbo smells really fishy, not typical of shell fish. I look through it and it looks as there is crawfish in there as well. I know for sure I do not like crawfish and if they would have told me that was included in the gumbo I for sure would have ordered another side. This isnt even the worse part. In Javier's gumbo there was something green and slimey looking. We had no idea what it was, looked like it could have been octopus tentacles or fish guts. Really it was that wierd looking. I now wish I would have taken a picture of it just to find out what the heck it was. Now I can admit I am a hard person to please with food, Javier on the other hand will eat almost about anything. Now for something to make this man not finish his food has to be really bad. Also the place was kind of pricy, our total bill was $14.00 and that included a buy one get one free meal coupon from the Entertainment book and 2 drinks. Needless to say we will not be returning. Yes I loved the sweet tea and the po boy, this was not enough to return back or to spend our $$$ there.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Dunkin catfish was my fav but everything was good.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "We went thre for lunch,  it was not too busy.

In my opinion, that seems a bit early to close on a Saturday night.  The decor was charming with a wood plank-like floor and Burbon Street meets bayou decor. Upon entering, we stepped up to a window and ordered: fried pickle appetizer, I had the chicken and shrimp dinner and the husband had the crawfish po' boy. We also ordered the peach cobbler for dessert.\n\nNow a $6 appetizer seemed a bit steep, but when we received the food, it was enough for 6 people! They were full strips of pickles -- not little picke chips. And they were delicious! I love fried pickles.\n\nI guess when you get down to it, it's all just deliciously spiced fried food, but this was really good! It was not too spicy which is sometimes a problem with Cajun food.all of the accompanying sauces were very flavorful and added a lot to the food. My husband really liked his po' boy as well. Included with each meal is a delicious fried roll. I mean, really. Who knew that southern food had a doughnut equivalent. OK, so it's not a doughnut. it's a deep fried dinner roll -- crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It's a really great invention.\n\nAfter chowing down on the generous portions, we ended up taking up the peach cobbler and ice cream home. Now maybe it was because we took it home, but I didn't really like the peach cobbler. I expected it to be more peachy and buttery.  My husband ended up eating most of it.\n\nSo my nutritionist will kill me when she finds out about this meal, but for a cheat meal, it totally hit the spot.

Oysters were fried black so the brought him some more and he took one bite and spit it out it tasted so bad. Hush puppies were still gummy inside while well done outside. Should have known that dinner wasn't going to be good when we ordered the fried green tomatoes and they were half ripe and burned but we thought we would try.

I was cookin' with Paul Prudhomme back in the early 80's before he was Chef Paul P! \nFor almost $50 we bought the combo plate with two meats and sides, a shrimp Po' Boy and an order of (3) Beignets with sweet tea. The Po' Boys are very good. The Shrimp was lightly battered and well seasoned, fried golden brown, sweet and crispy with just the right amount of spice. The roll was fresh and crusty. The red beans and rice were very good - lots of meat, beans were toothsome (not mushy) and the rice was done just right and it was spiced perfectly. The french fries were good, fresh, hot and crispy brown and moist on the inside.The sweet tea was just right and freshly made. Unfortunately - The alligator is terrible and the Boudan balls are just plain horrible. Alligator consisted of tiny breaded balls of flavorless chewy meat ranging from the size of a pea to a large blackberry - not one chunk or strip mixed with a lot of debris from the fryer (fried crumbles of batter). They were mostly tough and chewy. This is supposed to be tail meat which is usually pretty tender and there was very little or no seasoning. The Boudan balls were a huge disappointment. The filling was an unidentifiable tasteless gray paste with very little powdered spice, rolled in bread crumbs and fried. I pulled one apart and could see not one piece of meat, vegetable or rice. My best guess is that it consisted of bread crumbs with powdered spices and some binder (don't have a clue what). That they call this a \"meat\" selection is really a joke and for the price, absurd. When I was in NOLA I had Boudan balls at a half dozen different restaurants and they all contained meat, liver, ground with pepper/celery/onion/garlic, spices and rice . I've made my own for years and these resembled nothing like anything I've ever seen. There was no tartar or other sauce for dipping.The beignets are tough and chewy instead of the moist ,airy,  delectable powdered treat they are supposed to be like I had every morning at the Cafe Du Monde in N'Orleans. The combo plate contents and two of the three beignets now resides in my refrigerator, barely touched and will go into the garbage tomorrow....what a waste of money. If I wasn't so far away, I'd bring it back and explain why to the manager. So, if you go - which you should as there IS good food to be had, stick to the Po'Boys (NO ALLIGATOR!!!), gumbos, rice, fries and other selections.

I ordered the red beans and rice with andouille sausage.  The hearty portion of it that I was served was pretty good, but under-salted and perhaps under-seasoned, in general.  The highlight of the meal might have been our appetizer of Bourbon Hot Wings, which were nice and meaty with a good, spicy sauce coating them.\n\nWhat was really more atrocious than the food at The Bayou was the decor and the service.  Michael R. noted that the murals on the inside walls of the restaurant are tacky and touristy.  I'll give him that, but my bigger complaint was the furniture.  The restaurant is entirely indoors, and yet the only table/chair options are metal \"grate\" patio furniture!  Great for an evening outdoors (and necessary, I understand, if you need weather resistant pieces), but uncomfortable and unnecessary indoors. \n\nAnd the service was slow.  It took our server a long time to seat us, and to bring us our drinks.  The appetizer was slow coming out, as was the main course.  The time in between service and the obligatory check-in (\"how is everything?\") was long, as well, which was unfortunate because it meant that we didn't even get salt on our table until we were halfway through our main course.  The slow service also meant that when I was unsatisfied with my drink (I ordered an Old Fashioned.  What they served me was a watery glass of whiskey with seemingly no other flavoring), it took a while to exchange it (for the Nola Cola, which was actually quite good).\n\nTwo stars or one, the bottom line on The Bayou is probably still: don't bother.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Even though my experience at the Bayou was extremely marginal, I did actually think the decor was entertaining and interesting, at least.

My husband had the crawfish etoufee, which was creamy and rich, again with plenty of seasoning and reasonable heat.\n\nI have to take issue with other reviewers who say the food was bland because it wasn't spicy enough. Authentic New Orleans food, like food in most places, is spiced to the tastes of the eaters. Many, many dishes are made with only a hint of pepper or even no pepper. Kids eat in New Orleans too! What makes food authentic to New Orleans is the flavor combination of onions, bell peppers, and celery, plus any number of herbs and/or meats. It's always FLAVORFUL, not always spicy. The two dishes we tried had flavor to burn. I don't mind at all that they didn't burn my tongue.\n\nMy only real issue with the food was dessert. We ordered bread pudding and a mini pecan pie. The pecan pie was mini indeed, maybe four bites, contained two pecans, and tasted stale. The bread pudding was an odd concoction of bread, sweet potato, and chocolate. It was yummy, but in New Orleans you'd find that in an avant garde bistro that's trying to be different - so, not what you're looking for if you miss New Orleans food. Both desserts had clearly been microwaved (tell-tale hot spots).\n\nWe will definitely be back!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "The decor is very unique.

We had the artichoke hearts, crab puffs, and escargots for appetizers.  I didn't get the sense that the seafood was fresh.  Rather it was definitely of the frozen variety.  And everything was made with frozen puff pastry.  Even the escargot were covered with puff pastry. I think it was to cover for the frozen seafood?  Anyway, the appetizers reminded me of Pinterest recipes.  \n\nA big red flag for me is when there are too many components in a dish.  That usually means that the ingredients aren't good enough to stand out on their own or the chef doesn't know how to edit.  I think we experienced a little of both.  \n\nMy husband and I both got the special. It was a blackened pork tenderloin with shrimp accompanied by mushrooms in a sherry sauce with red potatoes.  Each component sounded good.  However, the presentation and preparation was a train wreck.  \n\nThe tenderloin came on skewers.  What?  The shrimp were over cooked.  The meat and shrimp were served in a jumble of quartered red potatoes and mushrooms.  Everything was covered in some sort of Cajun seasoning that was reminiscent of Durkee or McCormick.  Then it was all topped with some sort of cornstarch thickened sherry sauce.  The whole thing tasted like it was straight off the Sysco truck  and reheated. \n\nOne of our companions ordered the filet.  She let us have a taste, and the steak was good.  But it came with a buerre blanc dipping sauce.  I'm not sure what chef would pair buerre blanc with steak to begin with, but just like my meal, it was clear that the buerre blanc was another corn starch imposter.  \n\nDessert was a dark chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  It was dry and pedestrian.  \n\nReally I think this place deserves 2.5 stars, but Yelp doesn't do half stars, so I'll be generous.  Lousiannes clearly has a loyal customer base and is a popular place.  I would definitely go back for the cocktails and even the appetizers because the price point wasn't outrageous for all the puff pastry and I could still enjoy them now that I know what to expect.  \n\nBut I would not return for dinner.

Having never been to Louisianne's in the 5 years that I've lived in Middleton, I suggested we try it out.\n\nI give the atmosphere of this place a solid five stars. Although it has an rather bland looking storefront, the inside of the restaurant is anything but. You walk into Louisianne's and immediately head downstairs. It's all stone and looks like you're walking into a cool cave or something. It's dark, but there's a lot of ambiance. I've been to New Orleans, and it definitely has that sort of vibe to it. It's romantic, fun, and not what you'd expect from the outside. I felt like we were on vacation while we were there. Also, there was a live jazz band playing and they were really rocking. It was awesome!\n\nWe went at about 8pm on a Friday night had to wait about ten minutes for a table, which was fine. While we waited, we ordered drinks at the bar and watched the band. I had red wine, and my husband had Jameson on the rocks. \n\nWe were seated and ordered the Pecan Crab Cakes as an appetizer. They were good, probably just 3 stars though, as they tasted a lot like other Midwestern crab cakes that I've had before. They were heavy on bread and light on crab...with a lot of Old Bay seasoning. Again, they weren't bad at all, but not spectacular.\n\nNext, we ordered some more wine and our entrees (more on those in a minute).  We were given a choice of soup or salad with our entrees and we each ordered soup. They had two soups of the day: a shrimp -corn chowder (which I got), and a tomato-based pulled pork stew that was like chilli (which my husband had). Both soups were fantastic! Definitely 5 stars for the soup. \n\nI'll take a minute here to comment that I enjoy going to traditional restaurants from time to time, places where soup/salad and bread are included with your meal instead of everything being ala-cart. (It reminds me of dining in Wisconsin supper clubs as a child). By the way, the bread basket was delicious and was quickly replenished by the waitress after we ate all of the bread within 30 seconds of sitting down because it was warm and toasty (and served with soft butter) and we were starving! \n\nOnto the entrees! My husband absolutely LOVED his dish. He claims that it was possibly \"the best thing I've ever had in a restaurant\". He chose the Coffee Roasted Chicken, which featured a bed of (homemade) fettuccine topped with a coffee-crusted bone-in grilled chicken breast, in a \"hazelnut, orange, ricotta sauce\". I think there was spinach in it too. The pasta was perfectly al dente, the grilled chicken moist, and the sauce was rich and creamy. It almost reminded me of a Thai peanut sauce, but with hazelnuts instead. Although it sounded like something that could become cloyingly sweet, it was not. It had a nice subtle umami essence in addition to the sweetness. Delicious. 5 stars.\n\nThe reason that Louisianne's is not getting a five star review from me, however, is due to my entree, which I felt was very underwhelming. We don't eat pasta at home for health reasons, so I usually get it when we go somewhere nice as a special treat. I chose the tasso and shrimp fettuccine because it was homemade pasta, and because it featured authentic New Orleans style ingredients (for the unfamiliar, tasso is basically spicy ham). The shrimp and tasso pieces in my pasta were well-cooked, but they were sparse. The dish also featured mushrooms, and they were fabulous...probably the best part. However, the pasta was supposed to have a \"Creole mustard cream sauce\", and it didn't really. The sauce was very light, and had little flavor. It was kind of sad, because I was really hoping to be wowed and I wasn't. I'd say my item was probably 3 stars, and would have been awesome if only the sauce had been a bit more pronounced and flavorful. \n\nThe service was adequate. Nothing remarkable in either a good or a bad way.\n\nSummary: I'd definitely return. I think Lousianne's Etc. is a decently nice restaurant overall, and is great for special occasions. Their primary issue, from both my own experience as well as the reviews on Yelp, seems to be consistency. Some menu items are fabulous, and others are meh. The major problem with this is that Louisianne's  menu is at a price point where people only go occasionally...so the restaurant basically has one shot to impress, and if they fail at that, guests won't return for a second chance.

They claim their rib eye beats Ruth Chris's, I don't know if I would go that far..but it a very nice aged piece of meat that is well seasoned and comes out just as you ordered it and for $16 that is really tough to argue about. The bread your meal starts with is hot, fresh, and made that day. They make their own salad dressings and they make their own desserts, at least the pies. I have to say I really enjoy their dinner menu and if you can get past the patio and look away from the pool table crowd, you will have a great week day meal.

Not since the rigatoni's people owned it. We used to enjoy this place quite a bit as the food was good, patio ambiance was nice, and the service is usually spot on.\n\nOnly one Sunday afternoon tried again with the new ownership and left a bit disappointed. As mentioned above, the Trinity of restaurant experience of ambiance, food and service are necessary for good experience; however, if one is missing, and drastically missing here, experience is just marred.\n\nWe took a seat on the patio and were not greeted for 15 min. yes 15 full minutes sitting alone like hobo Joes. I kind of felt like leaving and going next door to dos gringos. The server finally approached was far from enthusiastic seemed like almost annoyance to her to be waiting tables this afternoon. Almost zombielike, probably just hung over. In fact all the service staff that I viewed seem to have this zombielike hangover.\n\nAnyhow, I asked her about the bloody Mary's and they were good as I assume they should be a roadhouse and she said, \"the other awesome this bartender makes a really good.\" I smiled and happily agreed and waited in anticipation for this bloody Mary of greatness. She left and we see her again for almost 15 min. which is absurd. When she did come back to the table she didn't have my drink she just wanted to take the food order simply said, \"you ready?\" Not much the menu lead huh. She took our food order and didn't offer an appetizer before leaving so I had to call her back to order one. Still no bloody Mary.\n\nWhen the bloody Mary did arrive we have been seated for about 27 min. yes 27 min. to get a drink. What's more disappointing is how awful the drink was. I'm not particularly picky as I felt you can't really mess up a bloody Mary but they sure did. Came out in a small plastic tumbler glass and literally tasted like tomato juice with barely any spice in it and no garnish whatsoever. It looked really sad and tasted sad. What really pissed me off was about 15 feet away there was a couple of guys seating at the bar who have bloody Mary's in glass pint glasses with a salted rim and a bunch of garnishes with some celery stalk and you can see from the color of the drink that it was made like a bloody Mary. REALLY!! It really sucks and I totally felt cheated. Restaurants without consistency drive me crazy. A Big Mac in Boston is the same as a Big Mac in San Diego. Your drinks and food should be the same. \n\nThe food runner or cook came to our table with an appetizer of sliders and said, \"your sliders.\" I told him that we an order that that we ordered shrimp and he said, \"what you mean?\" I found that almost comical statement as it reiterated to him that we had ordered shrimp not sliders. About 5 min. later shrimp came out. This is where I have a hard time deciphering between two and three stars for this place because the food is really good. The Cajun shrimp drunken appetizer was outstanding. I even thought of ordering one to go for later on.\n\nI had a Rubin and my mom had meatloaf. My mom's diabetic and can have a lot of sugar and the meatloaf came out with huge blobs of barbecue sauce on it. I'm not sure that was my mistake and I didn't read the menu correctly but I don't think I would have missed that. Anyhow we scraped off the barbecue sauce and my mom absolutely love smoky flavored meatloaf she commented about three times how good it was. My Reuben sandwich also was very good with an ample stacking of meat which I appreciated. Coleslaw was obviously fresh and had a good flavor but lacked the will of the seasoning and punch. Again food was outstanding. No doubt about that.\n\nAfter the appetizer was served I had seen that they have Corona light on tap so I ordered one. 20 min. to get a beer and I was nearly finished with my meal when it came.

We decided on the jambalaya spring rolls, and the bearded dragon wings. The jambalaya spring rolls came out sliced long-wise, which was pretty unusual, but worked out well since you could taste more of the crispy egg roll skin more in each bite. The filling itself was good, but there was mostly shredded chicken and cheese with a few chunks of Andouille sausage. The shredded chicken and cheese itself didn't add a lot of texture to the appetizer and made it a little mushy tasting on the inside. The dip that went with the spring rolls was decent, but very sweet. We started dipping the rolls in our leftover bearded dragon sauce and they actually ended up tasting better together than with the sweet Ho-chi sauce.\n\nThe bearded dragon wings were very good. The wings had a nice crisp crust, covered in a hot wing type sauce with a hint of sweetness. \n\nWe decided on the freedom dip and pulled pork sandwich lunch specials. The freedom dip had nice, tender slices of beef with melted cheese and crusty French, er, Freedom bread. The dipping sauce was good, not too salty. The pulled pork sandwich was a hefty portion of pork, with smokey slow-roasted flavor. It had just the right amount of bbq sauce and a generous portion of tangy crispy coleslaw. \n\nService was cheerful and friendly. Drinks were refilled as needed. \n\nWe came in with a Groupon, and the only thing to note is that if you order the lunch specials, the $7 deal won't count totally towards the Groupon. If you use it, they will add the drink separately to make it \"un-special\" since daily specials won't count towards your purchase. Still, we got a good deal regardless. Our total without the Groupon was a little over $26 including tax for 2 appetizers, 2 meals, and 2 drinks. \n\nI probably wouldn't have eaten here if it weren't for the Groupon, but now that I've seen that you get a really good deal for the portions and quality of food you get, I'm definitely going to make more visits to Iguana Mack's!

As I looked over their website, I realized, this is the same resto/company that I have had on my Vegas bookmarks for years.  The second I realized that, I bumped up my visit to \"today\".  \n\nGoing on a weekday at 4:30p has its bonuses - parking on Mill is much easier and Mill is not as crowded. So, I park and walk toward the restaurant.  The one thing I want to warn the Yelp community about is that the address says 740 S Mill Ave, the restaurant is actually facing 7th street and is west of Mill Ave (west/around the corner from Mellow Mushroom).  \n\nSo I went alone as this was decided an hour before I arrived.  I am so disappointed that you can't order a combo boil.  So I made up one.  I ordered 1lb of crawfish with the Hot and Juicy sauce served Spicy Hot.  I also ordered a half pound of shrimp (the only thing that can be ordered by the half lb) with the Lousiana Style sauce served Spicy Hot with sausage and a corn.  Each order comes in a plastic bag with enough seasoning to cover, but not drawn your crustaceans.   I couldn't eat it all, so I saved the shrimp order and ate the crawdaddies.  In general, if you like southern food that is spicy and full of flavors, my advice is to completely bypass the any other sauce option and go straight to the Hot and Juicy - trust me on this. (Order a different flavor as a side, thank me later)\n\nSo, I pull my first crawfish tail off and put that head to my mouth and sucked the head and out flowed the the hottest and juiciest crawfish deliciousness I had ever had in my life.  Sucking dem heads and pulling dem tails is how you eat crawfish.  But what I LOVED about these crawfish the most is how juicy they were!  So much seasoning and juice flows into your mouth out of those heads!  And the tails were tender and not overcooked.  So many places muck up crawfish by overcooking them!  They were also so tender and just right because they had not been frozen.  Yes, fresh, ALIVE when they cook them fresh!  Someone help me, I could have slapped someone it was so good!  I have eaten crawfish my entire life and I am pretty sure these were definitely seasoned the best because the Hot and Juicy sauce is so much thicker than the typical crawfish boil juice.  So the flavor just coats your mouth really good.\n\nThats it folks.  Get yo' self on over there and enjoy it.  Get over there, roll up your sleeves,  put on a bib (very important!) and get a beer! For Pete's sake, don't look like an amateur and wear the gloves they offer!  And always  remember to Suck dem Heads and Pull dem tails.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 19, "useful": 18, "cool": 18}}, {"text": "I am so happy that Hot N Juicy came to Phoenix!\n\nI've never been to it in Vegas but while I was at work, one of the trainers came in and told me about it (she was getting lunch for her team.)\nI'm not going to write a lengthy review, I'm just going to touch on the important parts\n\n-We waited for about 10 minutes before we were seated, which isn't bad considering it's a small place.\n-The customer service is wonderful!

We waited over an hour for a party of 5 on FRIDAY NIGHT. Another party waiting for a table even went and got Jack in the Box to snack during their wait, hilarious! So be prepared for a long wait because the place is not very big, plus they haven't even had their grand opening yet. I'm sure it'll get even busier so just know it's going to be a while to get a table. \n\nFood was AWESOME! At our table we got crawfish, shrimp, clams, snow crab, corn, sausage, and fries. All of them HnJ style and a variety of mild, spicy, and extra spicy. Crawfish were nice and juicy as well as the shrimp. They don't serve headless shrimp so be aware if you aren't accustomed to shrimp with heads on them. Snow crab was decent but the clams were a disappointment. Definitely add sausage and corn though and you'll be wanting more. \n\nService was pretty bad but we kept an open mind that they had just opened so I'm sure they're still working out the kinks and trying to keep up with the crowd. The table next to us (that was seated after us) was greeted, waited on, and ordered before anyone even came to take our drink order. When a server finally asked if we'd been helped we put in our drink order and food order altogether. It took forever to get our drinks and all of the food. The food came out staggered so not everyone in our party had their food at the same time. The clams took forever to come out and we had to ask the server about them 5-6 times. Finally we were done eating everything else and I decided to just cancel the clams because we were ready to go... Well that's when the clams magically appeared. The clams were definitely not worth the wait. \n\nOverall it was really tasty and we'll be back for sure. Hopefully the service will be more on point next time.

I can finally say there's a great place in town I can take visitors to if they never had Cajun food or even a seafood boil for that matter.\n\nLet's start off by talking about their crawfish! They are consistently fresh.  They pretty much perfected their secret recipe to a science.  The temperature and sauce is spot on.  I love my seafood HOT and SAUCY.  The garlic and Cajun spices truly pack a punch.  \n\nIf you are new to this, I highly suggest starting off with the crawfish since that is what they are known for.  If you just hate digging your nails into hard shells, then shrimp might be your next best option.  The beauty of eating this type of seafood is to taste the freshness from the sea.\n\nI always, almost order 2lbs worth of crawfish.  Why? You get free corn, potato, and sausages fused with heavenly Cajun flavors. \n\n A trick I love doing is to order a side of rice and making a poor man style gumbo.  As you are peeling your seafood, take the juices, like guts or brains from your seafood and dump it into you rice and let it build.  At the end, tear up some sausages and pour in your left over Cajun juice from your boil onto the rice.  Voila! Enjoy!\n\nSince they just recently opened, now is probably a good time to get your crawfish fix before the word is out.  There is a bit of wait during dinner time.  First come first serve.

Nothing was wrong other than we were asked by THREE other servers if we would like something to drink while our? waiter was getting us drinks.\n\nThen, after looking at the menu, all crab, shrimp, mussels, etc. say \"Market Price\" for the price.  I get it, this is how most local seafood places work.  HOWEVER, the prices aren't posted anywhere in the restaurant.  When we asked one of the servers how we would go about finding this out, he said to just ask.  So you're telling me I need to ask the price of the 15+ items that say market price? What?  A chalkboard would be fine!  The Salt Cellar and Angry Crab seem to be able to handle this.\n\nAlso, god forbid you drink two drops out of your water because you will then be swarmed by three kids with water pitchers.  I get it, the food is spicy, but if my water is more than half full it doesn't need to be refilled.\n\nThen, our server told us he was leaving for the night.  Ok, fine.  But after he left, nobody came and told us who our new server would be.  We had to ask.  Of course the first kid didn't divide up the check like we asked.\n\nLet me be clear.

The crawfish were good in size, not too many dead ones, but I could tell were frozen by the texture and flavor of their tail meat. The potatoes and corn were good dipped in the sauce however. I tried some shrimp which tasted fresh in the Garlic Butter sauce which was good and the calamari was kind of lack luster.\n\nThe service is a bit strange, they do attempt to refill waters almost every 2 minutes and each order comes out one at a time which is awkward for large groups.

Too bad metered parking on Mill Ave sucks butt but oh well!\n\nFor their grand opening, there were balloons, a red carpet, a cheesy Hot N Juicy backdrop, and people giving away swanky Corona Extra t-shirts and necklaces.

We each ordered 2lbs of crawfish [Hot N Juicy seasoning, medium spice] with an extra pound free and 1lb of shrimp [Lemon Pepper, medium spice].  I never felt so full after eating 2lbs of crawfish in my life!  I barely even touch the shrimp and it had to be taken togo with my extra pound of crawfish.  \n\nThe Hot N Juicy seasoning has always been my go-to even after all these years of going to Hot N Juicy.  It's the perfect combination of spices, garlic chunks, and herbs.  I like being able to see it coating my crawfishes.  Lemon Pepper is my second favorite because it's a bright sauce with a nice bite of black pepper.  This stuff coats the shrimp well too.\n\nI'm not sure if it's the gratification of not having to drive five-hours to get to Vegas but the crawfish seemed to be even better in this Arizona location.

We went there on Saturday around 1 pm and the hostess told us eta wait time of 15 minutes. The place was full and there was only one other party waiting before us.  We waited for about 20 minutes and our table was ready. I've been to boiling crab in cali several times,  so I was familiar with the drill but my party wasn't.  Our server Jazzmin right away asked us if this was our first time and kindly explained the drill and thoroughly went over each item on the menu and how much we should order.  We ordered half dozen oysters,  assorted shrimp (half lb Louisiana spicy,  pound hot and juicy mild,  and lemon pepper baby spice), corn,  and a catfish basket in case my girl doesn't like the spices on shrimp.  I'm not a huge fan of crawfish, so we skipped that.  When I visit my family in cali,  we always go to boiling crab and one of my favorite things is to order raw oysters as an appetizer before I start devouring my shrimp, so naturally I was looking forward to getting my Oyster first. I even asked the server if they could bring out the oysters before anything else and after she went to check with the kitchen and told us that it couldn't be done. I could've sworn oysters were on appetizer menu.... Anyway,  The first thing they brought out was the lemon pepper shrimp.  My daughter who can't eat spicy seasoning started digging in. Shortly after,  they started  bringing out other shrimp but still no oysters.  I asked the server if we could have our oysters asap as we ordered them for appetizer and she said she'd go check with the kitchen. She came back and told us oysters were still not ready.  By the time we were almost done with our shrimp,  they brought out the catfish basket.  The fish was hot, fresh,  and juicy and the side of sweet potato fries were also fresh.  My girl really like the lemon pepper shrimp,  so we ordered another pound and it came out reasonably quickly.  We were getting too full to finish the extra order of shrimp,  so we asked for a box.  By the time our server brought the box,  we were totally stuffed.  By this time, STILL no oysters.  It's not like our server forgot to put in my order,  she kept on checking with the kitchen every 5 minutes and I don't even know what the hold up was.  We ended up canceling our oysters but of course by the time another server brought our check,  we were still charged for the oysters. So additional 10 minutes or so spent unnecessarily to have the oysters taken out of my check.  \n\nAnyway overall everyone in my party was satisfied with the flavor and the amount of food ordered. I was bummed out about not getting my oysters and that's why I give 4 stars but by the time we were done,  I was so satisfactorily full,  it didn't bother me that much that I didn't get my appetizer.\n\nPeople started pouring in by the time we were leaving  (around 2:30 pm on Saturday) so I think we made it just in time.  Shrimp was plump, seasoning was flavorful (except the Louisiana one.

The price is fair, that other big fancy place (angry review forthcoming) charges $20, Cajun Seafood Corner charges $9.99. I understand the value crawfish tails have, but I was looking forward to more of them in my etouffe. Overall though, a pleasing price for such a dish and it was VERY edible! I cleaned my plate.\nThe jambalaya was kinda plain but still delicious. The andouille sausage was spot on. They do have boiled crawfish by the boatload, and also have some good appetizers, but they're all battered and fried.\nI think the best way to experience the alligator and catfish is to have them in the sandwiches which look pretty packed. The fried alligator is succulent and delicious especially with the chipotle mayo, but the batter is overwhelming. As with any battered and fried app, take away the batter and the pieces are small - the batter contributes a deceiving amount of volume and detracts from the perceived value.\nThey do have wings, but they're by the HALF dozen, which is disappointing from a volume and value perspective since I'm a wings freak and picky about my wings. I didn't order them and never will until a dozen is offered at a decent happy hour price. I think a lot of people will expect this too.\nThe frog legs were totally yummy! Sure wish there were more on the plate.

I'm glad he did, because my friend is a pretty hard-core vegan and she wanted to know all of the details.  Stinky's Vegan Gumbo is not automatically vegan.  The veggie chicken isn't but the veggie sausage is, and the side of potato salad isn't, but they can substitute black-eyed peas which are. So she ordered the Stinky Gumbo without chicken, and substituted black-eyed peas for the side, which normally costs $1 extra, but the chef said we could do it, so the waitress waived the extra fee.\n\nWhew!  It was a bit of work, but my friend was very happy to get exactly what she was expecting, and the chef was incredibly knowledgeable and courteous about her questions.  Apparently he was vegan for a bunch of years, vegetarian for a bunch more, and now just has the occasional meat to check out the quality in the restaurant. Perfect!  He even mentioned that he was trying to find a source for vegan chicken so that eventually there would be no substitutions necessary.\n\nIn our group we additionally ordered the seafood gumbo, chicken and sausage gumbo, chicken fricasee and hush puppies.

My husbands fricasee was a chicken and potato stew with rice and had a slower, but equally significant amount of heat.  \n\nThere was a poker tournament going on, so we were really the only diners at the time.

The two brews that my cohort ordered, TurboDog and Purple Haze are both made in Louisiana.  TurboDog is frighteningly dark-looking, without the heavy dark beer taste, think Amberbock if it was actually a good beer.

Yes I've read the other reviews but I've been and lived in New Orleans and I have to say I don't think this should be called Cajun.  The flavors are so bland I couldn't taste any spice at all on anything.

I ordered a Shrimp Po'boy, and my husband ordered the Jambalaya.  My shrimp Po'boy had old bread and was cut in half with 4 medium size shrimps on each half., sorry not enough shrimp for a sandwich that cost nearly 11 bucks at lunch.  The Remoulade sauce only had one flavor... Horseraddish, it was super strong and was awful.  So eh on the Po'boy, it came with a side of burnt homemade potato chips, ate like one and decided to pass on the plate of them.\nI felt really bad though looking at my husbands plate.  It was a stacked high rice dish with these shriveled up sausages thrown on the side of the dish.  I had a taste of his, first the rice... really dry.. Then I took a little bit of this beef jerky sausage, it was so dry and had no taste at all.  I told him he must dump hot sauce all over that dish because there is nothing going on there.  \nSo yeah.. not sure if it's what we ordered or what, but Flavors of Louisiana is way better if your craving Cajun food in the valley.\nP.S.

We were greatly disappointed.  Our order included 2 turkeys, gravy, cole slaw, dressing, cranberries and dirty rice.  The difference between this year and last year was so great that we couldn't believe this was the same restaurant. Let me explain. \n\nThe turkeys were good. They tasted the same. The dressing was okay but not as filled with nuts and flavor as last year. We had to add a lot of butter, chicken stock and nuts to make it tasty or even close to last year's savory decadence.  The cranberries lived up to last year's order. They were delicious. The cole slaw was a mason jar ($20) of mayo filled with 1/4 cabbage and 10 green olives minced. It should have been more like a salad and less like a mayo spread.  The dirty rice - last year was sticky long rain rice with many pieces of delicious nuggets of crumbly meat. This year it was white rice, similar to Uncle Ben's, loose and with barely any meat. Last but not least, the gravy. It was so burnt that we called the restaurant and returned it. Imagine eating burnt popcorn with flour, butter and Lawry's gravy seasoning and you'll understand. The second batch was only 40% burnt rather than 75% like the first order.   \n \nFrom the minute thanksgiving ended last year, our family was talking about the amazing meal. This continued to be the topic of conversation over the course of the year.  We were so excited to enjoy the flavorful, mouthwatering food again.

The service was good. Unlike other places, if a server was walking by and saw that you needed something, they took care of you even if it wasn't their table. Top notch.\n\nThe food was mediocre. I've spent a lot of time in New Orleans and am very familiar with Creole cooking. I spent a week there in 2011 and had the opportunity to spend some time cooking with several of the local chefs. Baby Kay's red beans and rice is made with a common dark red kidney bean. While this bean has its uses, it is not the correct bean for red beans and rice. The correct bean is less common, smaller, lighter in color and makes a much creamier dish. It would be like tying to make RB&R with a pinto bean, It's just not the correct flavor or texture. The bean used in Creole country is Camellia brand. While even the Camellia brand calls itself a \"red kidney bean\" it is the correct bean and very different from a dark kidney bean. I know that's a lot about beans, but this is an important distinction. Baby Kay's RB&R were too thick and not the right texture. Also, the rice was overcooked and mushy. It seemed like they were trying to hide it under the beans. \n\nThe seafood gumbo was just meh. It didn't have the richness you expect in a gumbo. It seems like they don't start their gumbo with a roux leading to a creole sauce. It was just a thin soup. Not the correct texture or flavor. Other than three shrimp which were properly cooked, but had no flavor, there were crayfish. Regarding the shrimp you really have to salt them heavily. These shrimp lacked seasoning. The crayfish were previously frozen and had a mushy texture. All in all not great. If a Cajun place can't get RB&R and gumbo right, there is no reason to try any of their other dishes.\n\nOne last thing, if you want to taste proper RB&R, as strange as it sounds, head to Popeye's chicken.

The first time was probably about eight years ago, and I honestly can't remember what I ate or any details so it can essentially be ignored.

The red beans and \"rice\" dish, w/andouille for an extra $1, is essentially a plate of beans with about two tablespoons' worth of white rice, plus about an ounce of their green olive coleslaw. Ok, it -was- reasonably spicy but should have been no more than about six bucks because what it really equated to was an appetizer as far as I'm concerned, and the amount of beans grossly outweighed the amount of rice. Their special today was 8 fried shrimp with dirty rice crawfish etouffee and one side. I got the coleslaw again. The amount of food, for $14, was pitiful - a half serving, essentially. And this time the flavor was just totally lacking. The full crawfish etouffee dish price is $19 which is murderously expensive and as I discovered today it just doesn't have much flavour. The dirty rice had what appeared to be minced beef in it and was light on the pepper.

And they fry them in cottonseed oil, just like Cafe du Monde. Do you need to know anything else? If you do, read on, but that's more than enough for me. The fact that their food is great too is just a bonus. ;)\n\nWe just got back from New Orleans. Two weeks ago today, in fact. We spent a week there just eating our way through the city. Of course, we Yelped our way through there, hitting all the hot spots for cajun, creole, and Louisiana cuisine. (And of course, we ate an inordinate quantity of beignets.) We had a good time.\n\nSo, when the beignet craving hit yesterday, we were out the door and on our way to Beauregard.\n\nWe were a little surprised when we found it was in front of the Harkins theater, and the interior is a unique hybrid of sit-down restaurant, Chipotle, and Starbucks. Cool. I like a restaurant that can do it all.\n\nWe went in late on a Wednesday evening, and while there were definitely other patrons there, it was pretty quiet. It was too cold to sit on the porch without a jacket, so we ordered and sat inside.\n\nI got the fried catfish. Husband got the fried chicken. We both got the sweet potato fries as our side.\n\nBest. Catfish. EVER. Catfish has an obnoxious tendency of either being gummy and non-cohesive, or tasting too strongly of mud. My catfish was the victim of neither. The fish fillets were large, firm, and fresh, with a nice flake and a perfect cornmeal crust. Tender, moist, and flaky on the inside. Flavorful and crispy on the outside. Perfectly golden. Outstanding. Their house tartar sauce is amazing, too--I don't usually like tartar sauce, and I could have eaten this with a spoon. So amazing. Lightly lemony, the right balance of thin and thick, with the nice addition of scallions. Bingo.\n\nHusband had the fried chicken tenders. The batter was similarly perfectly crisp and golden, and it was lightly seasoned, probably with a house cajun blend. The spiced aioli dipping sauce was good but a cajun aioli probably would have been the real ticket. The dip had a hint of cinnamon in it that wasn't our favorite. Sorry I don't have more to say. I was totally absorbed in my incredible catfish.\n\nThe sweet potato fries had us distracted, too, though. Soft and fluffy inside, and crisp and seasoned outside, my husband--the sweet potato connoisseur, who orders them everywhere we go that they are available--proclaimed them the best he'd ever had. And he usually prefers them with cinnamon sugar. The cajun seasoning on these fries is a SLAM. FREAKING. DUNK. Perfect balance between the sweetness of the tuber and the salt and spices of the seasoning. They go so well together. I'd go back just to down a basket of those fries. (But I'd order beignets and catfish, too...)\n\nIn short, the food was better than anything we ever had in New Orleans. Can't wait to try the jambalaya, the po boys, and other local favorites.\n\nSpeaking of beignets, we were so tickled to see a whole shelf full of Cafe du Monde beignet mix boxes in the kitchen. When we ordered them, the chef mixed the dough up, rolled it out, and fried it to order. Cafe du Monde was still fresh on our palates--we probably ate their beignets half a dozen times or more while we were in NOLA earlier this month--and so we were anxious to see how these would be.\n\nThey were fabulous. In fact, they might have been better--the dough at Cafe du Monde is slightly overworked. I'm sure they have to make it in huge mixers, which always risks overworking a delicate dough like beignets have. Because ours were freshly made to order, we enjoyed a more delicate beignet than we ever got to enjoy in NOLA, but the distinct Cafe du Monde taste--which comes from the addition of barley flour and buttermilk to the dough--was unmistakably there. Plus, the piles of powdered sugar on our beignets had been sifted at Beauregard, where it was just lumped on at Cafe du Monde.\n\nI asked about the waffles they serve, because Southern butter waffles are one of our favorite dishes, and their waffle is just a traditional, non-butter-enriched Belgian waffle. Toss some butter into that batter, guys, and we'll be in for breakfast, too!\n\nWHO DAT? Dat's Beauregard Food Co., and they's good.

Don't forget hot sauce.\n\nShrimp Po' Boy: There's a reason these things are so popular; because they're freaking tasty. Get one and thank me later.\n\nOyster Po' Boy: Perfect balance of flavorful batter and oyster goodness.\n\nFried Catfish: Catfish heaven (in Madison, at the very least). Po' Boy of this was surprisingly not nearly as impressive.\n\nSeafood Combo w/Sweet Potato Fries: If you're feeling luxurious, get yourself a medley of savory cod, juicy oysters and fresh shrimp. Go for sweet potato fries; the normal ones are average at best.\n\nShrimp \u00c9touff\u00e9e: Spicy and probably quite fattening, but a definite flavor bomb in your mouth.\n\nHot Sauce: Sort of a joke, but seriously put hot sauce on anything that makes remote sense. Especially the fried foods.\n\n---Stuff I wasn't AS impressed with:\n\nFried Chicken Breast Po' Boy: Just tasted like a slightly upgraded version of a generic fast-food sandwich. I got it for the relatively low price. But it was still somewhat tasty.\n\nCatfish Po' Boy: Surprisingly I thought the Po' Boy overpowered the natural tastiness of the catfish. I might have to give this another try, though, because I do love catfish and po' boys.\n\nBBQ Beef Po' Boy: Probably my least favorite entree on the menu... just tough cubed beef drenched in barbecue sauce on bread. Okay.\n\nJambalaya: Peppery and tasty to an extent, but not as flavorful as I would have hoped.\n\nRed Rice and Beans (w/o Sausage): A bit overhyped without double sausage, although still good. Hot sauce is a must for these.\n\nShrimp Creole: Good and spicy but not incredible.\n\nMardi Gras Combo: (the above 3 in one dish) Actually the 3 together are a decent balance: if you're going to get one of them you might as well get this and get all 3.\n\n---Everything else I've tried that doesn't fit into either of those two categories\n\nDeb's BBQ Shrimp: Great potential, good flavors, but seems a bit one-sided in terms of just lemon and butter. I can't really explain it; wouldn't recommend it nor discourage it.\n\nFried Gulf Shrimp: Above average if you're a fan of fried shrimp (and decent portion) but then again it's... fried shrimp. I'm a bigger fan of the Po' Boy.\n\nDirty Rice: I'm still trying to figure out what I think of this in comparison with the other dishes. It just seems like rice with salt and cayenne plus trace amounts of other spices that somehow augment the taste a little bit.\n\nThat turned out a lot longer than it should have but honestly there isn't a single thing that I've had here that I was \"disappointed\" with (or for anything that was I disappointed with, it was because I had set the bar so high from previous trips here).

All the garlicky goodness of that red shabang sauce was just how I remembered it.  Note: The shabang was really limey in flavor, but I actually enjoyed that better because I didn't have to waste my time squeezing all those tiny limes onto my shrimp.  so nice that the lime essence was magically incorporated in already.  The consistency of the shabang sauce was not as grainy and pasty as I'm used to, but all the right flavors were still there.\n\nShrimp -- One of my friend's bag was overcooked, but the other friend and I had no complaints about our's.  The medium could have been a bit spicier (since I remember medium being really really spicy), but it was still yummy as ever.\n\nClams -- Sooo good.  Most of the clam meat fell out of the shells, but that made it taste even better since direct contact with shabang is always best.\n\nFries -- perfectly cooked; not too spicy.  And not oily at all.\n\nCatfish -- HOLY MOLY.  Flaky and fresh.  It tastes best when you dip it in both ketchup and the tartar sauce.\n\nGumbo -- Perfectly seasoned AND they had more okra than the Alhambra locations.

The whole sha-bang would definitely be my suggestion.\n     - Spice Level - The options are Non Spicy, Mild, Medium, and XXX. If it's your first time and you don't like spicy, I'd go mild or at most medium.\n     - Flavor - Your seafood, spices, and extras are cooked in one bag to lock in all that flavor. I personally like to peel my shrimp and then dip it back into the sauce.\n     - Ordering - You order your seafood and what seasoning/spice level you want. I'd recommend the shrimp  with \"The Whole Sha-Bang\" Mild or Medium. Also, you can add sausage and corn to it too. The corn soaks up a lot of the sauce, making it extra flavorful and spicy.\n     - Warning - If you order shrimp, crawfish, or crabs, you're eating with your hands so that gets kinda messy, but they give you bibs. Also, because of the intense flavor of the sauce, you'll probably be sweating garlic for a while.\n     - Red Herrings - Water is 25 cents (They say it's filtered), there's no hand towels in the bathroom (only blow dryers. I guess to save money?), and extra condiments including ranch are 50 cents each for a half filled condiment cup. It doesn't seem to be a problem yet, but these actions seem to give the impression the restaurant is pretty stingy.\n**Ordered**\n     - $5.99 per lb. Crawfish (Frozen) - It was $9.99 for the fresh crawfish, but since it wasn't in season, the waiter said they'd be smaller. The frozen are a great deal, but you can taste the difference.\n     - $8.99 per lb. Shrimp\n     - $9.99 per lb. Clams - If you like clams, clams with The Whole Sha-Bang adds a delicious twist to them.\n**Comparison with Hot & Juicy**\n     - Prices on Extras - Corn is the same. Half a pound of sausage from BC is about a dozen and a half sausage from Hot & Juicy, so you're getting a little more at BC. Potato is 10 cents cheaper.\n     - Flavor on Extras - The corn is the same anywhere but the sausage from Hot n Juicy's seems tastier.\n     - Prices on Shrimp/Crawfish - Shrimp is $2 cheaper. Fresh crawfish is the same, however, they also have the choice for a cheaper frozen crawfish.\n     - Seasoning - Comparing the \"works\" seasoning at both, BC's seasoning seems a little oilier and Hot n Juicy's has more garlic/spices. Personally, I prefer Hot n Juicy's but only by a little.\n     - Conclusion - My two favorite items are shrimp and corn. The shrimp is cheaper. However, I like the seasoning at Hot n Juicy's. But then again, the last time I went to Hot n Juicy the seasoning seemed watered down. I'd give it to BC until they raise their shrimp prices or start skimping on their quality.\n**Recommendations**\n     - I'd recommend this place for a good experience and a delicious meal.

I'm at a 50/50 decision here where one seafood joint outruns one trait and another for something different.\n\nHere are the pros and cons: While the 1 pound shrimp may feel like you're being swindled in quantity, I think the quality of shrimp cancels it out. The shrimp SIZE is big. Which I am thankful for since it requires less work in peeling shrimp, and the taste of wonderful shrimp does suffice at every bite. It gets discouraging sometimes peeling small shrimp, and feeling like you didn't pop enough shrimp in your mouth to enjoy it. The SHABANG SAUCE tastes different from HOT AND JUICY's house sauce. Shabang is a bit more tangy, salty, and less spicy. Which I actually love. If you're an indecisive person when pick a good sauce, pick the Shabang since it compiles all the sauces together. I went for mild tonight to be safe, and thankfully it wasn't as spicy as I would have assumed.\n\n25 cents for a cup of water.

As I liked spicy the most at the table, I ended up eating most of these - everyone tried one, and enjoyed the flavor, but most didn't want to deal with that much heat.\n\nI'm not a huge catfish person, but the fried catfish was decent. The sweet potato fries didn't have any extra seasoning, but I preferred them to the cajun fries.\n\nAlso, as this type of place serves the food in the bag of sauce, it's messy as all hell. Your hands will smell like seafood for hours afterward, no matter how much you wash.

But after experiencing both, I prefer Boiling Crab over Hot & Juicy for a number of different reasons. \n\nLOCATION: Close to my house! at Flamingo & Decatur in the Food4Less shopping center. The restaurant is HUGE. 2-3 times the size of H&J with much higher ceilings. Unlike H&J, you can smell the food but there's enough fresh breathing air at BC for everyone. \n\nSEAFOOD: You have the option of choosing fresh or frozen crawfish. The fresh is supposed to taste a little better at double the cost but the frozen is much larger. We got the frozen and I didn't think anything bad of it except one or two of the buggers had an awful ocean taste (the bad kind). Shrimp can be ordered in half-lb increments (the ones we got were overcooked). 1 lb of Snow Crab is 5 legs and some body. Definitely need at least 1 lb / person if your doing crab.\n\nSAUCE: We tried a variety of the sauces. Lemon Pepper, Cajun, and the whole sha-bang. We went with all Mild heat. H&J has a tendency to be ridiculously spicy (as in heat) even when you order Mild. The Medium over there killed me! The sauce at BC was wonderful. The Sha-Bang was definitely my favorite. Full of flavor and spice, heavy on the garlic, but not to hot. I'll probably go Medium the next time I come. \n\nSIDES: Freshest fresh oysters in Vegas! They were tasty, meaty, and had a healthy gloss to them. I could've eaten a whole dozen myself! The ones I've received at H&J in the past were subpar quality and not that great. And what's not to like about sweet potato fries? \n\nSERVICE: We had a few different people serving us. Luckily, there were no mistakes on our order and everyone was pretty friendly.

The wings and fries came out first, it was covered in their \"cajun\" powder and I wasn't impressed as there wasn't tons of flavor for being \"cajun.\" \n\nThe shrimp and crab came out at the same time. The sauces were red which wasn't what I expected (should have looked through pics first) not necessairly a bad thing. It had sort of a tomato based texture with chunks of their \"cajun spice\" and garlic. The sauces were alright, I just felt that the sauce didn't penetrate through the shrimp and crab. I know that's part of the food experience when you end up dunking them before putting them in your mouth, but it was that bland that you HAD to redunk them in the sauce. Luckily it was just the 2 of us so we could double dip. The shrimp was way over cooked to the point where the shell was so hard to take off. Crab meat was pretty meaty, but without the awesome flavors of the sauce it was just regular crab. I ordered a side of rice and the rice was dry and old...not very appealing. We didn't end up finishing our meal which is surprising seeing as we didn't eat all day. \n\nOverall, I'm disappointed that I had a not so good experience at this place when everyone hyped it up and said it was better than any other place! Service was good, bathrooms have no paper towels which saves tress, but kind of a hassel. One of my friends recommended that I go back again to give it a second chance, but I won't be for awhile.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Went to boiling crab after reading the reviews and hearing all the rant from friends.

The walls are are tattoo with writing from the restaurants patrons which is kinda cool.  Each booth has a small LCD screen that has some sort of sports game on.  Also, there is big shark hanging from the ceiling!  The waitress line the table with just wax paper for you to eat off of and they serve your food from a bucket!  Very much in the theme of sea food.\n\nHere's what we ordered between 2 people:\n- 1 lb of boiled shrimp spiced with, \"the whole sha-bang\" $9.99\n- 2 pieces for corn on the cob $0.75 each\n- 1 Steamed rice $2.00\n\nThe shrimp came in bags and were seasoned perfectly.  For me it goes perfectly with the steamed rice because the rice just soaks up the flavors.  For the faint of heart keep in mind that the shrimp is boiled and it is not devained.  Over all the food was abundant, delicious, and affordable.  A lot of the people there were getting the deep fried catfish.  I think I'll try that next time.  One thing is, the place doesn't have a liquor license yet....so they suggest to bring your own beer.  There is a Food 4 Less in the same business park for you to pick up some brewskis.\n\nWhat brought this review down 1 star is the service.  The servers are young and seem to be social with people other than the patrons of the restaurant.  You'll notice it as soon as you are greeted from the hostes.  My wife was with out a drink for majority of our meal....and with spiced shrimp it would help having some water.  You don't have one dedicated server either.  You're seated and you're order is taken by one person.  But, then the rest of the meal your server is who ever you can flag down.  \n\nOverall you gotta check this place out!

They have the Cajun style seafood with your shrimps, your crawfish, lobster, crab legs, cajun fries and they tailor to your tolerance of spicy!

No! Will I ever test how hot their spices are? Probably not! If you know the movie starring Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, Along Came Polly, you'll know exactly what spicy food does to me! LOL!\n\nBut the reason I give BC a 4-star rating is for the other items on their menu! The fried catfish and cajun fries are TO... DIE... FOR! I ask for extra tartar sauce for extra dipping, limes to drench it in it's juice, and if a friend is kind enough to let u dip some catfish in their Whole Shebang sauce, give them a big hug and be sure to have a few mints on deck cuz the smell of your burps and breath will kick like a mule! More like a pack of mules! They give 4 or 5 HUGE catfish filets along with a medium sized basket of fries (regular and sweet potato fries are also available!).

We went on a Thursday and were seated right away.  We ordered a couple punds of crawfish 1 with the cajun spice 1 med and 1 mild some boiled shrimp and some fried shrimp and fries for our young son (2.5yrs).  \nThe boiled food all came out together and was prompt and tasted good to great no complaints here.  \n\nNow the bad.

Then we immediately ordered some additional boiled crawfish. After 15 to 20 minutes of no food and no server we sought someone out to figure it out. Another 10 minutes and our server shows up saying they must of sent our order to another table. She rushed our order and offered 25% discount. A nice gesture but sadly the poor service continued, as our toddler continued his downward spiral we tried to get our check and waited another 10 minutes.   Over all the service was lacking and inattentive.  \nThe food was good but I found the crawfish to be a tad overcooked and hard to peel. I probably wouldn't have noticed that if I wasn't already upset by the poor service.

The corn made the meal even better. I consider myself a corn connoisseur. I hate when I get corn that has been soaking in a water bath for so long it is flavorless and soggy.

The basket comes with large pieces of fried catfish.  They taste amazing, tender, and extremely moist ^_^ The fries are crisp on the outside and soft on the inside (my fave way to eat it!).  The Med seasoning is a dry season and was pretty good as it had a teeny tiny kick but you can still taste the food.\n\n2) Gumbo with rice $6: Dont get this item.  Totally not worth it!! The gumbo was pretty bland that I had to put in a ton of Tabasco to make it taste like anything.  They barely give you any rice (please see the Service note below). \n\n3) 2 lb. Crawfish (She-Bang seasoning and Med heat) $10/pound:  When the bag was first placed on the table, all you see are super large crawfish soaking in a bath of liquid yumminess.  Then you grab one and is let down that there isn't even a small kick to the Med heat.  And the more you dig in, the more you notice the crawfish are smaller and smaller.  Yes i understand that it is still by weight so its not like you're getting cheated... but I want big ones and that's that!!\n\nFOOD (2nd round of orders): \n1) Chicken Tender with Fries (XXX heat) $7:  The chicken tenders aren't anything special and the pieces are not large (but at least they weren't small lol).  Same fries except the XXX seasoning was all heat and no taste.  \n\n2) 2 lb. Crawfish (She-Bang seasoning and XXX heat) $10/pound: So i should have explain their heat level earlier - the XXX is suppose to be the hottest one as its stated on the menu \"Cant feel my mouth\" and the level right above that is the Med... They need to figure out something to go in between the Med and XXX.  The XXX was indeed spicier then the Med but if you're a restaurant you should know that a hot level should still mean you maintain the taste of your food! \n\nThere was so much cayenne/chili pepper in the dry XXX heat that you couldn't taste any of the food.  All you get is a coating of dry power that overwhelm your taste buds.  \n\nI would like to make a point that is probably not that important but for me I feel like its something worth noting... They only give you one corn when you purchase at least 2lb. bag of crawfish. Which is fine... but where is the potato!?!? Yes I know this isnt Hot n' Juicy... but where is it!?!?!\n\nSERVICE:\nWhere should I start... So our server didnt introduce himself so i'm only assuming his name is Spencer since it was on our check which may not be correct since half way through another waiter assisted us. \n\nHe wasnt really friendly as we had to ask about pricing for everything.  I'm sorry, if I'm inquiring about pricing, wouldn't you assume i would like to be inform and you should be nice to let me know instead of me having to pull teeth????\n\nOur waiter talked my fiance out of ordering the XXX the first time around, which is \nfine and we took it as friendly advice.  However, when we got our Med heat orders we wanted something spicier, we asked if we can get a small side of the dry XXX seasoning so we can get more kick.  We were told he cant do that but if we wanted to order something else such a side order of corn, I can get the corn in a big soaked with liquid XXX sauce... great so if I want to season my food to my liking, you're going to make me buy more... right... This annoys me the most since he was the one convincing us not to order the XXX in the first place.  \n\nAnyway moving on... I ordered the Gumbo with Rice and I didnt get gumbo with rice.  The whole reason for going to Boiling Crab was cause I was craving rice with lots of sauce!  And what could satisfy my craving for saucey rice?? Gumbo! but nope, didnt even hit the stop.  I had to stop another waiter and tell her that I didnt get my correct order.  Instead of just bringing me a cup of rice, she takes my whole cup back to the kitchen and comes back with it...when i get my cup back, it looked like someone took 1 spoonful of rice and dumped it in.  I didnt realize rice was such an expensive item that I cant even get more than 1 spoonful.  \n\nSo after all this interaction, our waiter comes by and ask us how we were doing.  My fiance being the nice guy that he is says everything is great where I said things werent so good.  I'm pretty sure our waiter thought I was being sarcastic since my comment came after my fiance and it assume it was though \"oh its awful but i'm still stuffing my face that's its obviously amazing food\"... nope, I didnt say it like that or mean it like that.  He just walks off like nothing happened.  \n\nSo i'm writing this review a few hours after my visit to Boiling Crab... and in our group only three of us had their \"fresh\" crawfish... and now all three of us arent feel so well.  \n\nThat sums up my extremely delight experience and will never stop back in that place and any of their other locations.

We got a booth and they put down a large sheet of butcher paper to protect the table during the meal. \n\nI didn't want to overeat like I always do, so we ordered a pound of shrimp - with the \"all of the above\" seasoning with mild spice - along with an order of corn and 2 orders of red potatoes. Since we were starving, I broke tradition and got an appetizer of the gumbo with rice. \n\nGumbo was good, nothing that blew me away. Definitely get it with the rice because it's pretty soupy even with it. Good flavors, a decent amount of shrimp and sausage, but I wouldn't necessarily order it again. \n\nThe shrimp came out with all the goodies in the bag. Corn tastes amazing after it's been soaking in there for a while. Our shrimp were hot & tasty. I think I like Hot & Juicy's seasoning mix a little more - I recall it being a bit more flavorful and savory, but this is just as good. \n\nI like to cut my potatoes open at the art of the meal so they can cool off a bit, then I dunk the halves into the juices at the bottom of the bag. This is extremely delicious and I recommend you do the same. \n\nOur server was great, made sure we were well tended to since once you start eating your hands will likely be covered in tasty juices.

No I don't work there or own any stock in the company.***\n\nAfter all of the rave reviews that I've read & heard about from friends, I decided to give the Boiling Crab a try. My first visit to Hot & Juicy was literally 2 weeks ago, so despite my typical high alcohol intake, the experience was still fresh in my mind.\n\nLike Hot & Juicy, a friend & I also visited Boiling Crab on a Friday night. The place is pretty big, with TVs all around. STRIKE 1: It wasn't crowded (or @ full capacity) and the wait was minimal (7-10 mins). That shoulda been a sign to get in our cars & drive up the street to Hot & Juicy, but it wouldn't have been fair to leave without even walking inside, right? \n\nSTRIKE 2: The server was ok, but he definitely wasn't as fun or friendly as any other servers I had recently encountered. I ordered shrimp & crabs @ XXX spice level, with the whole shabang (Cajun, lemon pepper, & garlic sauce). My friend ordered fried calamari & crawfish @ medium spice level w/the whole shabang. \n\nAnyone who knows me (or has read any of my reviews) knows that alcohol is always an important part of my meals. As usual, I had already indulged in some vino before we arrived and was hoping to keep the party going by keeping the liquor flowing. STRIKE 3: This place only sells beer. No wine! I asked if we could bring in a bottle & have them uncork it for us, but that wasn't an option either.  I'm not a big beer drinker so I think I opted for raspberry ice tea instead. I was obviously already tipsy cuz I hate iced tea! What the heck was I thinking? The goal is to continue the buzz, not kill it! Why was I even still there after 3 strikes? 3 strikes & you're out, right? Blame it on the al-al-al-al-co-alcohol! \n\nAnyway, food finally comes out & in my opinion, it was just ok. The shrimp didn't seem as fresh (one should not have to fight w/the fishies @ the table) as those @ Hot & Juicy and the seasoning is nowhere near as savory! My friend said the calamari was dry & the crawfish was also just ok. Don't remember what kind of crab we got, so it was obviously forgettable.\n\nNeedless to say, I was pretty disappointed and haven't decided if I would even visit any of the other locations to make a comparison. Granted, I had an amazing time @ Hot & Juicy during my initial visit, so it would be difficult for any other place to add up in comparison.\n\nMy advice is to run like the wind to Hot & Juicy Crawfish where you can get fantastic food, fabulous service, & vino to go with your meal!", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I have been to Hot n Juicy so many times that I wanted to expand my horizons and finally tried Boiling Crab.\n\nI first thought this would be a rip off HnJ type of joint.

You can also go with other item like oysters which are raw, snow or blue crab which are boiled, fried shrimp which BC won't soak in sauce for you, etc and they're all at market priced I believe.

I thought it was really cool they let you write on the walls too!\n\nWith places like this, I come generally for two things only...crawfish and shrimp. I was glad to see that Boiling Crab clearly differentiates between frozen and live crawfish. There's a huge difference and for those complaining about the work to reward ratio, you just ain't doing it right! :P \n\nI ended up ordering 1lb of each and loved every bite of it. The crawfish were perfectly cooked and I was in body cracking, head sucking heaven. Even the shrimp were cooked as close to perfect as you can get. They have a couple seasoning choices and if you can't decide what you want, they'll throw it all together for what they call the \"Whole Shaw-bang\". I opted for that on the crawfish and although I didn't taste much of the lemon pepper, it was delicious. For the shrimp, I ordered it with the \"Cajun\" seasoning, which is spectacular! Both were super flavorful and with the medium spice, it's the perfect heat level.\n\nIf you're not into shrimp or crawfish, they have several other options from oysters to lobster. My little man had some crab legs which they happily made plain for him and he devoured them. For those who don't eat seafood, about the only thing they offer is chicken wings, but the wifey ordered those and said they were pretty decent.\n\nWhen it comes to the service, I had no complaints. Our waitress was great and made sure we were taken care of from start to finish. The prices are good too! And while I'm always wanting to check out new joints with crawfish, I'll definitely be back to The Boiling Crab when I want an amazing, messy meal!", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 4, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Went here for lunch based on a friend recommendation.

After experiencing the crawfish craze in the Westminster area of Southern California, imagine my delight when I saw the sign for \"Hot N Juicy Crawfish\" in Las Vegas.\n\nThe BF and I anxiously awaited the opening of this first of its kind restaurant in Sin City and finally got to sit down to dinner the past Sunday.  Inviting a couple of newbies made the dining experience that much more enjoyable.\n\nWe started off with a pound each of the crawfish in every flavor - Juicy Cajun, Garlic Butter, Lemon Pepper, and Hot n Juicy Combo.  At $8.99/lb, it was a dollar more than SoCal prices but we were okay with it.  For every two pounds you order, you get one corn and one potato.  So, we made sure we got our corn pieces and potatoes and were able to choose what flavor we wanted it in.  (In the end, we ordered additional corn and potato on the side, corn runs about 50 cents each.)  We also threw an order of sausage ($2.50 for half a dozen or $4.00 for a dozen).  Depending on the season, they should be offering Dungeness crab, Blue crab, and shrimp.  You can also order oysters, fried shrimp or oyster baskets, Catfish Po-Boy Sandwich, or a Basket of fries.\n\nThey didn't ask us how spicy we wanted our crawfish, later on telling us they automatically make it spicy unless otherwise stated.  The heat was a good amount, not too hot that it was unbearable and enough where we reached for our beverages.  Of the four, I would say the Juicy Cajun had the least flavor while the Hot n Juicy Combo had the most.  We ordered four more pounds of the Hot n Juicy Combo in this sitting.  The sausage was actually spicier than the crawfish!  We also found the crawfish to be pretty clean overall.  We're ones to suck up all the juices from the heads too, so they gotta be clean.  And I gotta admit, the last two pounds we had were especially good.  They do a good job on having cleaner crawfish than other places I've experienced.\n\nBe sure to get the salt and pepper mixture too.  You get a bowl of cut up limes and you squeeze all the lime juice into the little plastic cup and mix it all together.  This is usually meant for you to dip your crawfish in, but I found myself not needing it that much.\n\nService was better too.  Upon entering, they line your table up with the white plastic covering and lay out a roll of paper towels.  They also provide bibs too.  You can ask for plastic gloves, but they just get in the way.  They asked us often if we needed refills on our beverages and how we were doing overall.  (I would say this is probably because they are a new restaurant, I only hope they continue with this service in the future.)\n\nThey had a steady flow of customers this holiday weekend night.  It didn't get too busy, but they were never empty either.\n\nIn conclusion, the four of us were pleased with our experience at Hot N Juicy Crawfish.  It looks like we'll be coming back here a lot!

I ordered the Hot n Juicy Special, which is probably all the others mixed together and was satisfied with my shrimp.  However, I ordered medium and it wasn't spicy at all.  I ordered half a dozen sausages with my shrimp and they were big pieces.  I also ordered a side of corn on the cob but they forgot it so I had to remind them.  When it came out, I took a bite and made the ugliest face ever.  I threw the rest away because it was bitter and drenched in too much seasoning (but I can't really complain about the second part).  I tried my friend's order of Cajun Fries (medium) and THOSE were spicy!  The fries came out crunchy and fat (skinny fat, not fat fat, if you know what I mean lol), which were yummy-o!\n\nI also tried my friend's deep fried soft shell crab and I don't think I'm a big fan of soft shell crab (I don't even love it in sushi rolls).  However, he enjoyed it.\n\nThe decor is much like any other crawfish restaurant, it was spacious and the setting was comfortable.  The service is mediocre; no smiling faces but they refilled my drink before I realized I even needed a refill!\n\nOverall, I like you Hot n Juicy.  You didn't disappoint me (but that may have been because I already knew nothing would ever beat Boiling Crab!)  I love that everything was BIG and that the seasoning didn't suck.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to try crawfish in every city you visit, you won't be disappointed but you won't come out thinking it's the best place in the world either.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Try rolling their chicken wings in their sauce that ends up at the bottom of the shrimp/crawfish/seafood bags!  =D", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 0, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "This place is awesome.  \n\nThe best crawdads I have eaten since I left Louisiana 13 yrs ago.

Wonderful stuff. This time it was the service that sucked and eating out is and should always be an enjoyable experience..entertaining. Food was great. Service killed the experience. If you enjoy seafood and are willing to risk some REALLY unpredictable quality of service..then yes go enjoy yourself. Sometimes you can let a bad server roll off of your back and eat on because the food is worth it but this time I couldn't even do that because we half of our requests and orders were misplaced or forgotten. Great....\n\nI have to drive from lake las vegas to get to the middle of town where this is located. So..number one, the first thing that I ask afterwards is..was it worth the gas money and the time driving. No it wasn't. It's been awhile so the details and the names of my servers are fuzzy but in general what happened was this...\n\n1) I ordered rice with my crawdads and shrimp because I like to catch the juice in the steamed rice and eat it after I've done with the seafood. My order of seafood came but I was never told they ran out of rice. What irritates me MOST is I ordered long before the table next to me arrived to the restaurant but they got the last of the rice. Huh? So I ask about my rice and the waitress tells me they've run out. I ask if they are going to make more and she says no. So I shrug and ask for some bread and a bowl so I could spoon some seasoning into for dipping. She says..we don't have bread but we have rolls. Again...Huh? Okay..so I say that's fine and order a roll. My bread didn't come for a long time so I ask if I may have a roll from another server. He brings the roll finally. No bowl still. I just figure..alright..this is a bad night and drop asking for a bowl.\n\n2) We arrived more than an hour until they were ready to close but were told their kitchen was closing in 5 minutes...so we would be unable to order. I think..strange..but you're open for just over another hour. Later she tells other people the kitchen is closing as well but we hear them arguing a bit about ordering and she learns that the kitchen IS still open for new and later hours and she comes back to tell me we have more time to eat and order other things. I ask...hint hint hint...are you going to be making more rice? Because if so, I would still love to have a bowl. Yep! So I put in another order of rice. Yay...rice. It just isn't the same without it.\n\n3) Finally the rice gets there. The attention to our table is dismal, and there were only 8 tables in total with 2 servers waiting the entire room. We should have had decent service. I cannot comment on if this is abnormal service because in my first review we got there right when they had opened and it was wonderful. It wasn't a matter of flagging anyone down..it was a matter of getting our waiters to remember our orders or requests. My god...if remembering isn't working for you..how about this? A pen and paper.\n\nTo gloss over it all we ordered a refill on the iced tea. Never got it. We ordered more rolls..never got that. Asked for a bowl. Never got it. We decided to order something new and asked for an order of calimari. NEVER got that. I'm batting 0 out of 4 here. It wasn't just bad service it was some of the worst I've had in a long time. The sort of bad service that you talk about all the way home because it feels like you just got dropped into The Twilight Zone and wonder if it were really real.\n\nWe got up and paid for the bill. Asked them to cancel our calimari order. They said \"What order?\" Just par for the course! LOL\nThen we asked for a container and extra bag to put the extra shrimp in to eat later at home because as much as I disliked the service the food was REALLY WONDERFUL. Didn't get that. Should I have expected any better that night. Geez was there some kind of karmic payback at work here??? LOL\n\nWe asked again..finally on the 3rd request we got a bag and a container. I finally just broke down and asked if it were an unusually bad day...short one person on staff or something ..anything to explain the really bad experience..the missed orders, the forgetting requests, not knowing their own business hours. Etc etc etc\nNope, he said. Great....\n\nAnyways..I think the thing that finally topped it off for us was having to pay for the stupid bowl of rice after that fiasco...when I think would normally have been comped when a bad experience is actually brought up to staff. What's a bowl of rice cost versus having lost 2 customers and telling everyone how bad the experience was? Ah well....as an after thought I have to tell you something I discovered that was really awesome.\n\nIf you go to the big asian seafood market like manilla seafood or ranch 99 you can pretty often find a really incredible thing. 5 pound bags of frozen crawdads in cajun seasoning ready to cook and eat for only 10.99 or so.

You order some type of shellfish (crawfish, shrimp, crab), a type of sauce (I go with the hot & juicy special), and tell them what else you want thrown in... potatoes, corn, sausage (I recommend all three).  A few minutes later they bring out a big plastic bag filled with the goodies and they plop it on your table.  No plate, no utensils: just rip in and enjoy.  You're going to get messy, but they provide a bib and there's paper towel rolls at each table.  Make sure you do not neglect to get the sauce all over everything you put in your mouth.\n\nI recommend washing it down with an ice cold Blue Moon.\n\nThey do also have fish & chips, and some pretty great chicken wings, so you don't have to get messy to enjoy a meal here.

I reserve one open star for the future if service can be improved. The food is ALWAYS 5 star however. \n\nThis update is to raise a rating that was lowered due to poor service and dining experience as detailed in a previous review.\n\nThe owners addressed all of my issues, and  was professional in his communication with me. Any negative issues I did have were dealt with in outstanding manner.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIf you read my previous reviews you'll notice a negative experience I had reviewed as my first update. It was based strictly on poor service. The food has always been outstanding. What I would like to say in this newest updated review is that, more business ownersshould take up similar customer service. Kudos to the owner of Hot N Juicy Crawfish.\n\nI gave this place another chance because the food has always been a delight. (still love the shrimp over the crawfish) If you go, always add a pound of shrimp.\n\nIf you decide to eat at this establishment, you can be assured of excellent food. If you have a negative experience, and bring it to the owners attention, you can be assured of excellent customer service. I've learned that there is a difference between bringing it to an employees attention versus the owner when it's really negative. My experience with the owner here proves he cares for his business and the experience of his customers.\n\nWhen I went back, prices on the crayfish were the same as before. Stable market pricing probably because he has stable distributors. The crawfish is fresh. The shrimp was sweet and meaty. I had almost the same meal as before but included the calamari that we were not able to order before. That was tender and the coating was light and non greasy.\n\nI think what struck me most was the owner had read my single negative experience and took my negative points and made changes in his operation. When I had said they ran out of rice, he told me he purchased a larger rice cooker. Amazing responses. There were a few other things that showed how he cares for his business.\n\nIn the few months I've been watching this place it's grown in popularity. There was the man vs food show taping on food network for example and the following viewing party. Sometimes one wonders if popularity like that can falsely lift up the appeal of a place but I have to tell you, behind the scenes it's simple, excellent food, and acceptable service that makes this place a gem. \n\nI think what I had experienced was scaling issues. As a place becomes more popular they have to adapt with new ways of coping so there are less nights they run out of what ever ingredients...servers learning how to deal with busier tables..etc etc. They are adapting quickly and solving issues that crop up and maintaining an excellent standard of food.\n\nIf you go, do not expect a 5 star quality of service. BUT....it's not bad. It's average and acceptable if you go with the right frame of mind. What shines here is the FOOD. Not quite sure what people are complaining about when they talk about the quality of their crawfish. Perhaps my tune would change if I were from the deep south but I am not. My reality is what is around me, and for this area, they have the best crawfish and shrimp. Do not compare a place to somewhere across the country. Make comparisons with local places to help people that are looking for the -best in that local area-. It makes it easier for people that are just visiting. They don't care about what is better in some other part of the country.\n\nConcerning the bathrooms. Objectively, I have never seen a line. Perhaps on busier weekend nights you may have to wait your turn, but it's hardly a reason not to go. There is one woman's bathroom and one for the men.\n\nAmazingly good, comfort food. Nothing is as satisfying than a big pile of seafood you eat with your fingers. They get it right, and the food out of this kitchen is always top level. I've tried numerous sauces now, numerous seafoods. Different times of day and different days of the week. I find it better than Joe's Crab Shack because it's authentic here.

The spices left me out of commission the next morning but  was worth it at the time.\n\nWe also ordered the King Crab which tasted OK but it definietly wasnt fresh. You can tell it was frozen stored because the shell was soft and stale when it came to our table.  When you peeled the shell off, a lot of water came gushing out.\n\nFor $20 something a pound, we expected fresh.  \n\nAll in all, it was a fun experience we thank Adam Richman for telling us about.\n\nBTW, they need to move that dumpster full of rotting crawfish leftovers away from the part of the building thats visible.

We never had crawfish before this night, at least not a properly prepared crawfish meal. We manage to finish all 2 lbs of it because the spices was just that good. On the other hand, the shrimp was so good, the large amount of garlic in that buttery sauce made the shrimp so sweet and tasty. We just can not stop eating the shrimp!!! And the soft shell? nothing worth mentioning, except for the Cajun fries we dipped and ate with the sauce in the crawfish/shrimp bags.\n\nThe whole experience was pretty good, the whole meal cost us $57 which I thought was a little high.

So i patiently waited only to see people come in behind me and walk up to him and he wrote their names down.  I figured he was smart and courteous enough to realize that i've been standing their waiting especially since we were blocking the aisle and he had to constantly excuse himself from walking past us.  Of course he sits other's before me and i have to go up to him and ask him about my table.  Expectantly, he tells me i'm next and to just be patient.

It's right off the strip you'll need to take the cab there. It's never busy in the day time ( not sure about at night). My 1st time eating crawfish was at this place few years ago but never gotten a chance to write a review about it. Ate  there like 2 times while was in vegas.  I still hear good reviews from family members and friends who just got back from there recently this year. This place is the reason I became obsessed with those little critters. There were pics of celebrities on the wall who also ate here. NICE!  The environment is decent looking and the service was good and acceptable. There's always plenty of paper towels around and bathrooms are clean. Anyone who hasn't tried it should give it a try. It's worth every penny. Come on now... it has to be that good to make it on the food channel and travel channel. I think man vs food made the right choice. Boiling crab just isn't buttery and hot enough for a  challenge. \n\nBelow is a little  review comparison between Hot n Juicy special sauce vs boiling crab whole sha-bang sauce. I've been to boiling crab about 8 times now in SJ and 1 time in anaheim and it is so far  the best in CA. I usually order 6 lbs.  I read some reviews here from others who had tried Hot N Juicy crawfish and I have to completely disagree with them calling this place a duplicate or copy cat of boiling crab. They should go get their taste buds checked. Hot N Juicy is 5x buttery/stickier and a bit sweeter but they do have xtra spicy as an option. Their sauce will leave your fingers smelling for days that's how good it is.  Boiling crab on the other hand has that smokey taste and their spice is acceptable. I normally order xtra spice.  What happens in vegas stays in vegas except for the smell it follows you home. Hot n juicy crawfish still remains #1 as my favorite place. 5+ stars from me for their awesome delicious foods.Boiling crab is right behind it unless Red Crawfish in SF can knock it to 3rd place.

The skin and heads of the shrimp were falling off, and some pieces of shrimp were definitely too soft for my liking. We were probably only able to get through a pound-if that, of our order.

In the past few years, virtually every place she thought I would like turned out to me... just Average, at best... And she heard from my youngest kids, that Dad doesn't like to touch his food - which is mandatory at Hot 'n Juicy.\n\nWhen your Pound of either Blue Crab, Shrimp, or Crawfish is brought out in it's plastic bag... the Plastic Bib and the Paper Towels are definitely not enough \"protection\" to prevent yourself from getting MESSY! In fact, I'm proud to admit after the four of us finished the 2 pounds of combos - we had the largest remnants of \"stuff\" by far of anyone dining that evening.\n\nYou'll receive a free Cob of Corn and a small Potato with every 2 Pounds of stuff ordered. But, I recommend more - just for the fact that you'll have something pretty neutral to offset the HEAT from the Crawfish.\n\nHot 'n Juicy's recommendation of how to eat Crawfish is:\n 1) Gently twist the head apart from the tail.\n 2) Take the head and SUCK the juice from inside.\n 3) Peel away 2 to 3 segments of shell from the tail to expose more meat.\n 4) Pinch the bottom end of the tail while carefully pulling the meat out of the shell.\n\nI have a few modifications to this procedure... Why would I suck on a Crawfish head when I don't do it to it's bigger cousin Lobster? That just.... SUCKS! I break off the tail from the head section and only retrieve the meat from the tail section.\n\nThe absolute best value is the Shrimp...\nI treat the Shrimp at Hot 'n Juicy like the Salt & Pepper Shrimp that is prepared at Chinese restaurants. I consume the tail section, shell and all - it's just too much work trying to de-skin the Shrimp! When Robyn heard that --- Eww!\n\nRobyn's recommendation: Order a pound of Blue Crab Legs and a pound of Shrimp.\n\nKevin and Kathy's (my daughter) suggestion: Crawfish and Shrimp.\n\nMy suggestion: After a Crawfish & Shrimp combo... I'd go for a Shrimp and Shrimp...\n\nSuggestions for sides - Bread Rolls, Potatoes, Sausages are OK. Corn on the Cob, which is boiled along with the Crawfish literally turns into Cream of Corn - way too soft.\n\nAnd... don't Breathe and Eat at the same time! Took me a few minutes to recover from the HEAT going down! Kevin tried some of my Spicy Crawfish and subsequently devloped a heat reaction - blotches of red all over his face and neck. I think for most - Spicy is hot enough.\n\nRobyn was totally shocked when I gave Hot 'n Juicy a Yelper rating of 5-Stars - despite that fact that you can't avoid getting Messy here and despite scrubbing down with virtually all the Soap in the restroom afterwards and returning home probably needing a Bath / Shower... you can't help but have a pretty good time!\n\nI can't think of a more enjoyable time to spend a couple of hours people watching - customers or your dinner companions getting down n' dirty with the Crawfish, or just to lower your own clean-freak inhibitions.\n\nI was wondering why this restaurant was located in the un-officially designated Chinatown along Spring Mountain... So far as I could see that evening, there was only one waitress of Asian descent... I queried our waitress whether Hot 'n Juicy was Asian-owned - she replied that the owner was Thai and resided in Texas and was the second Crawfish place he owned.\n\nHighly recommended by one who abhors using his dainty fingers....\n\n\nI do have one last thought though....

What can I say, I was fiending. While I was a little skeptical reading some of the reviews from loyal Boiling Crab fans (because honestly, who doesn't love BC), I decided to give it a shot. So, let me reiterate that I have been to both Boiling Crab and Hot n Juicy, and each has their pros and cons. I personally think they stack up pretty well (and I have reviewed both).\n\nPros for Hot n Juicy:\n\n1. Wait time was less than 10 minutes for a table for 2. It was a \"slow\" night for them (Monday) around 8ish but there was enough space to sit while waiting. While we were waiting, C and I searched their wall of Polaroids for Adam Richman's...of course, he had his own frame.\n\n2. Wait staff was friendly. Our server Amanda was excellent. She checked in with us frequently and let us know that the kitchen was closing and asked if we wanted any more food before then. After it was kind of cooled down a little (we were one of the last to leave) she came over and talked to us and we bonded over our dogs. I think that their wait staff is WAY nicer than BC's. They say hi as soon as you walk in the door...and they smile. Who'd have thought.\n\n3. Price is pretty good. After reading previous reviews, we decided to skip the crawfish, and we got 2 pounds of shrimp (with their version of BC's \"whole shabang\" sauce) with sausage (which are bigger), sweet potato fries, and 2 beers a piece and the total was less than $45. I saw complaints about the shrimp being overcooked, but ours was done perfectly.\n\n4. They have a full bar.\n\n\nCons for Hot N Juicy:\n\n1. Their parking lot is tiny...fits maybe 20 cars. We had to park in the lot across the side street and walk over.\n\n2. Restaurant is a lot smaller than BC. If you go on a super busy night, it might take you a bit longer to get seated. That's the main reason that we went tonight instead of on a Saturday.\n\n3. You walk out of there smelling like crap. But...you would at BC too. So I guess that's not much of a con.\n\nIn terms of the food...the level was about the same, although I will say this (and I hope it makes sense): while H&J was a little bit spicier, BC had more flavor to it. My friend and I both liked the sweet potato fries here better than at BC. The size of the sausage (har, har, har) was bigger at H&J. Beer prices were the same, which is a huge plus. You really can't beat $3 for a Corona. Both places have TVs, which at the time were playing the Lakers game.\n\nIf I was in town again, I would probably end up going back.

Nothing like the first time we were there. Not only that our friend had ordered 2 lbs of king crab legs. 1 with their special sauce and 1 just steamed (plain.)

So we ask for the manager and the jerk in charge said with a smile \"there's no manager available right now\" and walked away.

Hot n' Juicy is definitely the messiest eatery in town, and all the more fun because of it. Sometimes when I give that description people don't want to try it, but it would be a shame not to. Besides the fun of eating here, the food is great. How can you really go wrong with fresh seafood, butter, and Cajun seasonings?\n\nToday I ordered one pound of the crawfish ($9.99) and my husband ordered one pound of the snow crab ($13.99). We both asked for the Hot n' Juicy special seasoning, extra spicy! You are free to choose your heat level as well as the style of seasoning you prefer - Louisiana Style, Juice Cajun, Garlic Butter, or Lemon Pepper. Besides crawfish and snow crab, you can also order dungeness crab, blue crab, king crab, or shrimp.\n\nThe first time I had a crawfish boil was at my brother's graduation from University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee. I remember them dumping huge buckets of steamed crawfish onto the tables and everyone would just have at them, discarding the shells and heads onto neighboring tables. At Hot n' Juicy it's a little different, but not much. You are given bibs and your table is covered in white plastic that is accessorized with your own roll of paper towels. They bring your crawfish in plastic bags that are tied at the top to capture the heat. When you open the bag you get an aromatic burst of spicy steam that gets you really excited for what you are about to enjoy. This is where the fun starts. Crawfish are peel and eat little buggers that require somewhat of an experienced eater to navigate through them in order to get to the savory bits. First you must detach the tail, which you peel just as you would the tail of a shrimp. Then, and this is most flavorful part, you must suck the head by gently squeezing it into your mouth so you can get all the juices and inner goodness out of it. If this sounds totally disgusting to you, go for the crab. They supply you with crab crackers, but Ian and I agree they should probably pre-crack them for you to make the experience easier and allow all the seasoned butter to seep into the meat. Whatever you decide to get, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.\n\nIf you order two pounds of crawfish you get a hunk of corn on the cob and a red potato in your bag, but since we ordered one pound each of different items we opted for the Cajun fries ($2.99). These came out hot n' spicy with a side of cooling ketchup. We managed to reserve some of the fries to dip in the juices at the bottom of our bags, and this was way better than the ordinary condiment.

A mild is more like a medium so keep that in mind if you cant do the spice. It was nicely flavored and GARLICKY so plan to have time to shower a few times before seeing other people! MMmm garlic. Other sauces can be had with zero spice for those who can't do heat (garlic butter, cajun, etc).\n\nThe shellfish was very fresh. I rarely eat crawfish since the last few places I've gotten it at  it tasted like mud. It was fresh, juicy and \"clean\" (no mud) aftertaste. Shrimps were a good size and not overcooked- still succulent and had \"the snap\". We also put half a dozen andouille  sausages in with our shrimp (meaning half a dozen slices- not individuals sausages) which were great in the sauce. Ask for some lime/lemons and salt and pepper. I find when it gets a bit too spicy, dipping the meats in lemon helps balance the HNJ sauce out.\n\nFor sides I needed my rice! Hahaha I swear, a Filipino girl can't have shrimpies with no white rice. It was $2 for a small bowl and I can easily devastate a few bowls when I'm eating spicy...so in that sense- they are making a killing off this per scoop thing.

I guess I'm spoiled coming from TX and New Orleans where crawfish over $5 a lb is considered highway robbery!! My mom died when I told her I spent $9.99 on crawfish.

Blanche ordered the Fried Catfish basket that comes with fries for $9 and change.\nThe fried shrimp was delicious. Cooked perfectly and nice size pieces of shrimp.

A bit overpriced at nearly $5 for a medium size basket of fries but oh well.\nBeer was $2.50 for domestics and $3 for imports. Not bad.

The flavoring was great; we ordered medium & it was just enough for me. My nose was running a little & my eyes got watery, but I enjoyed it. I think next time I'll stick with crab legs cause I definitely have that down to a science ;) The cajun fries were straaight up cajun! I'd have to stop myself after a while because it would get a little spicy. Soft shell crab was good, just wanted marinara sauce from the calamari instead of the tartar that the soft shell came with :) The calamari was house made, but it wasn't anything fancy for me.

We walk in 5 minutes before they close and was promptly greated by our server who ended up later giving us a really bad attitude.  But before I get ahead of myself, she initially tells us that we have 2 minutes to put in our order.  Because we come there very often we knew what we wanted and did not hesitate to waste time and gave her our order.  We ordered 4lbs of shrimp, Louisiana Style, plain with extra spicy Hot N Juicy Sauce on the side along with some lemons and salt and pepper.  The same way we order it every time.  We had also ordered  1/2 a dozen of chicken wings.  \n \nNot more than five minutes later we get our order, but not how we had ordered specifically.  The extra spicy hot and juicy sauce had come all mixed in with the 4lbs of shrimp that we ordered making it very spicy, painful to the mouth, and unenjoyable.  But because we walked in prior to closing, we did not want to hassle the kitchen and waiter to remake our food.  Instead we asked our waiter  for some extra hot butter to help balance out the spiciness in our food. Our waiter stated that the kitchen was closed and that there was nothing that she could do.  So I had asked politely to speak to a manager.  But our waiter told me that there was no manager available.  We then asked her if there anything that she can do to make our food less spicy and more enjoyable but she still persisted that there was nothing that she could do and that the kitchen was closed.  Regretfully, I was upset and had belittled her in front of my friends using inappropriate language.    \n\nAfter getting no response or help from our waiter, we began to remove ourselves from the table and left the mostly untouched food on the table and headed towards the door.  We had barely eaten any food because of how spicy it was.  We were then greeted and cussed out by a  who claimed to be a manager.  He threatened that he would remember us and told us to \"fuck off\".  And I'm sorry to say that he received the same treatment back.  Shortly after another guy who also claimed to be the manager tried to listen to the situation and made us believe that he had understood what went wrong.  He stated that he would have this issue taken care of with another manager the following day and we gave him our contact information for them to contact us.  He shortly after sent us on our way.  \n\nSince we were still oh so hungry we went across the street to eat some Pho.  Five minutes into eating, Las Vegas Metro Police walks in stating that the Hot N Juicy staff claimed that we dined in and ran off with our tab unpaid.

Ever since then, I became an instant fan.  I've located cajun seafood restaurants closer to my place of residence, hence Crawdaddy's and Boiling Crab.  Anyhow, by far, Hot n Juicy blows the other two out the water, HANDS DOWN!!  I just went to Hot n Juicy over the July 15th weekend and the ish was BOMB DIGGITY!!!  Their crawfish was huge.  Usually I think you get about 13-15 critters per lb, this time the crawfish were so big, we got about 8-9 per lb. But so worth it, I mean they were so big, I even ate the critters' claws...OMG! - tell me the last time you had a crawfish so big, you could eat their claws?\n\n** As some of you may be aware, I'm allergic to shell fish but DAMN, I make sure to bring my benadryl so I can grub out without having to break out in itchy hives.

The garlic flavor can get pretty strong as it leaves it's mark on your breathe, and infiltrates every article of clothing you're currently wearing.

What a great concept: Bags of boiled seafood, paper on the tables, no plates, just finger lickin!  I love it when places make it fun to eat your food.  You never have to give me any excuses to eat with your hands, I will always be there for that party.  \n\nThis being said, I was not extremely impressed with the food at Hot n Juicy Crawfish.  The crawfish were frozen the nights I've been here, but they always say they usually get in fresh when they can.  The flavors were all pretty good, although I preferred the Hot-n-Juicy flavor and the cajun one was also very good.  The food came by the pound, and when we asked how much to order she told us about a pound per person.  This was way too much!  But I can never be mad at someone for suggesting a lot of food, it will all get eaten at some point, right?  \n\nThe food was relatively cheap, at around $10 per pound of each type of seafood.  We got the shrimp and the crawfish, and wish I would have tried the Dungeness crab, it sounded really good.  \n\nIf you're looking for a fun meal to grab with friends, definitely try out Hot n Juicy Crawfish.

The service is consistent and commendable.\n\nHowever, what they improved in service, they still lack in taste.  Let me digress for a second: the spine of any seafood-in-a-bag formula is the sauce, something that resulted from Vietnamese people living in New Orleans, loving crawfish, Cajun spice, butter, garlic, and more garlic.  The Viet crawfish craze started in Houston, jumped to Westminster, and spread nationwide.  Hot N Juicy is the Las Vegas response to a community that contains a sizable Vietnamese population.  They caught their lucky break from appearing on the Travel Channel.  But they cannot be the representative for the Vietnamese Cajun crawfish subculture.  Which brings me back to sauce: Hot N Juicy's most popular sauce for any seafood in a bag is far behind.  Besides being too watery, it also contains too much garlic (yes, it's possible).  There is having enough garlic to highlight the flavor of the seafood (something Boiling Crab & Claws in Orange County do well) and there is suffocating the flavor with too much garlic.\n\nThere is one thing I love here, which are the sweet potato fries, fried to perfection with the right crisp.\n\nI'll go to Hot N Juicy if my Vegas friends crave it; but if it was up to me, I'd ask them to work on improving the sauce, like they have with the service.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "Maybe I never come when it's packed but people in LV are sleeping on this place.

Spicy, it was especially my request of Louisiana Hot and Spicy Special was definitely the spiciness it supposed to be, just like in the South! Small chunks of garlic and ginger were visible as part of the seasoning. Besides the crawfish, the oysters on their half-ed oyster shells (my favorite!) were large and fresh. With sprinkling of lemon juice and butter sauce gave it the \"to-die-for\" yumminess. Also, the crab legs (presented steaming in a plastic bag) was remarkably meaty. A side order of corn was drenched with garlic and butter with a little spiciness of Creole seasoning. Oh, corn-soft-ness!\n\nAlas, this is a place for hands-on eating for juicy seafood! My Mom and I was delightfully full and messy. Yes, there were splashes of red on our bibs and table cover from the Creole-Cajun-Louisiana sauce but no cares.

In Vegas, your greatest weakness or vice becomes the source of all your pleasures. We were ready to give into our carnal desires and get down and dirty, indulging our voracious, gluttonous appetites. We wanted to get stuffed with something Hot N Juicy. \n\nHot N Juicy is known for their seafood: crab (Dungeness, blue, snow), shrimp, and of course, crawfish. You pick the type of seasoning (Juicy Cajun, garlic butter, lemon pepper or the Hot n Juicy Special) and the level of spiciness (mild, medium, spicy or extra spicy). \n\nWe ordered 2 lbs of snow crab legs and 2 lbs of crawfish with Juicy Cajun at medium, 2 pieces of corn, 2 red potatoes, etouffee (a Cajun seafood stew, similar to gumbo), and a side of sweet potato fries. Eating at Hot N Juicy is not an elegant refine affair. It's messy work because they dump a plastic bag of whatever seafood you ordered and you're only protection is the plastic table covering and a plastic bib. You open the bag and dig in.\n\nThe crab meat was very sweet and juicy. It was perfectly cooked. I found that the spiciness of the food depended on the type of seafood because the seasoning is on the outside of the shell. The meat isn't spicy unless you soak it in the sauce first. I found the level of spiciness in the crawfish much higher because the tail meat was much smaller and there was more shell around it, unlike the crab meat where I could pull out large pieces of meat out of the shell. Also I got more spicy sauce from the crawfish because I sucked crawfish heads. After a while my lips got tingly and numb from the Cajun spices. \n\nI've never had crawfish whole before. I only had them de-shelled. While I love crawfish and the meat was great, I'll never have them whole like that again. The tail meat is rather tiny (I like 'em big -- size matters when it comes to these things). At the end, we looked at the mountain of shell and agreed that it was more work than it was worth. Crawfish is mostly shell and I'd rather pay someone to shell them for me.\n\nEtouffee was a spicy rice seafood stew. I liked the flavor and the level of spice was just perfect for me. I thought the rice was a tad overcooked and mushy from just sitting in a pot all day, but in general it was enjoyable.\n\nThe boiled red potatoes were much needed as a break from the relentless Cajun spice. They were nice and sweet. The corn is out of season, so not as sweet and juicy as in the summer, but still tasty. The sweet potato fries were crispy and tasty.\n\nThe final price for all of us was $30/person for three people. We gorged ourselves on great seafood and left utterly satiated. Happy ending for us indeed.\n\nWhat happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.

Had to wait 30 minutes.  \n\nWhen they sat me down, the menu looked identical to what it was 2 years ago.  They told me because of the new opening of a 2nd Hot 'N Juicy in Washington (D.C. or state?) the shrimp was buy one and get one free.  Sure, why not?  So I ordered 1 lb of crawdad, 1 lb of crab legs and 1 lb of shrimp which turned into 2 lbs of shrimp.  \n\nGot the Hot 'N Juicy flavor which is a combination of all their flavors together.  You get four different flavors to choose from (check the website's menu) or you can just combine them all.  So I did this and asked for extra garlic.  And I emphasized a lot of garlic.  And I chose medium as to how spicy.  I remember the 1st time I went I ordered either the spicey or extra spicey and after 2 lbs of crawdad my mouth and innards were burning.  So I decided on medium this time.\n\nThe tables you sit down at are covered with a plastic sheet.  You get a bib to eat all your food with also.  The food comes out in a plastic bag that holds your food and the juice of whatever flavor you chose.  While eating your food, you crack and open whatever it is you're eating directly on the table.  After you're down, the waiters just come and wrap up the entire thing with that plastic sheet and voila!  A brand new clean table is ready.  I thought this was so cool the 1st time I came here so I made a complete mess of myself and the table.\n\nFood came out and I started to chow down.  There was a ton of garlic in my bags, it was outstanding.  They forgot my bib and half-way through my 1st bag I asked for my bib.  One of the waitresses actually tied it around my neck for me 'cause my hands were already all messy.  I laughed as she tied it for me!  That's service!\n\nFood was even better than I last remembered.  Shrimp was completely on point being moderate to big sized.  Choose snow crab for my legs and they were great.  And of course the crawdad was excellent.  After 4 lbs of food the spices got to me again.  Will have to go with mild sauce next time-sigh, I'm just getting old and can't quite handle my spicy foods like I use to.\n\nSo overall Hot 'N Juicy actually improved since I last came here-amazing.

Unfortunately, being located in the Tri State area, there is a lack of crawfish which saddens me. Since I was in town for work I jumped at the opportunity to eat one of my favorite shellfish friends...crawfish!\n\nAfter leaving the CES convention center, my colleagues and I hailed a taxi* and requested to go to Hot N Juicy located in Chinatown. A split second later, we realized Hot N Juicy sounded like a strip club so we joked around with the taxi driver and insisted it wasn't a peep show. We were going to that AFTER we ate.\n\nMy colleagues didn't know it but I was giggling like a little school girl when we arrived. Unfortunately for them, they aren't as adventurous when it comes to food so they ordered calamari, chicken wings and fries which they enjoyed.\n\nOur waiter was extremely informative, briefly describing to us (mostly me) how to order the seafood (per pound), by seasoning and spiciness. Since I've been to Boiling Crab I already knew what I wanted...2 lbs of garlic butter crawfish with medium heat. The garlic butter seasoning is SO mouth wateringly good that I could drink it as a side (not recommended though). They serve the seafood in plastic bags with bibs and paper towels. This is the messiest meal you will ever eat but so worth it. I was in business attire but was able to leave without any stains!\n\nAs I twisted and separated the head and tail, sucked the head and pushed out the meat from the tail...my colleagues looked at me in complete disgust like I was a monster. Did I feel bad? Not at all. I easily finished the 2 lbs of crawfish like a true fatty. I ordered medium heat but my mouth was on fire pretty much the entire time I was eating so to counteract the heat, I took big swigs of beer which helped. \n\nThe seafood pricing on the menu says market price so be sure to ask the waiter beforehand. The crawfish was about $10 per pound. Currently, they're having a BOGO shrimp special because they opened up another Hot N Juicy location in Washington, DC.

Tip from my boyfriend: instead of using just a sprinkling, ask for a ton of limes/lemons, and fill one of the little containers with the juice. Then, load it with the salt and pepper. It gives you a flavor option besides the spicy, buttery sauce, and kinda cuts through the grease.

You can choose to not wear gloves, but your hands will stink (especially if you order it hot and juicy, which is all the sauces mixed into one)\n\nEven on a wed night, there was about a 30 minute wait.  The waitstaff is all really cool.  Atmosphere is relaxed.  But eating the food is not as relaxing as the rest of the place.  We were sweating, the food can be very spicy if you want it to be, be careful!  I wouldn't come here on a first date either.  Ripping off shrimp heads awkwardly wearing gloves (or not) may be too much to handle for some people.  \n\nI would def come back, it's great place to have a bunch of food and get your seafood craving satisfied.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 5, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Solid 4.5 stars.

I had heard that it was casual, not too expensive for seafood and had an interesting approach to service.\nWe went there Monday night for dinner with our boy, Sean, who was visiting from So. Cal. We found the restaurant on the sleazy edge of Chinatown in a small strip center next to a Chinese massage parlor and a karaoke bar. Didn't look to special on the outside but even out in the parking lot, we could smell the garlic in the air.\n\nWe went in and it was equally unimpressive inside but we were greeted pleasantly and seated quickly by the window under the neon light....ah, ambiance. The table was covered with a thin plastic tablecloth and contained only a roll of paper towels. The slender menu listed a variety of shellfish, crab, shrimp and, of course, crayfish, all of which are ordered by the pound. Side orders were limited and included mostly corn on the cob, rice and french fries or potato.\nWe ordered the crayfish with Cajun sauce, shrimp with lemon-pepper sauce and blue crab with the garlic sauce. You can order any sauce from mild to paralyzing spicy. We went with mild which turned out to be pretty spicy on its own accord.\n\nThe food comes out piping hot, almost too hot to touch; dropped unceremoniously on the table all tied up in a plastic bags with all that sauce. You open the bag and dig in with your hands...no tableware of any kind except for a cracker for the crab.\n\nAs to the quality of the food...delicious...hot and juicy. All the sauces were fabulous. The crayfish is something we'd not order again, although it was fun to eat. You have to be a real 'crayfishianado' to suck the juice out of the heads like some do (we won't). So that leaves you with the tail which contains about a  \" piece of meat that took more work than it was worth to get to. The shrimp (head, shell and tail intact) were fabulous. Twist the head off, peel the shell and eat to your hearts content. We also tried a fried dish...breaded soft shell crab which was served with french fries...also delicious.\n\nIf you are looking to take people out to an impressive 'Vegas-style' food event, this is definitely not your place. But, if you want an inexpensive place with wonderful seafood, and don't mind getting your hands a little dirty, then I highly recommend it.

Probably more along the lines of Megan Fox, Denise Richards, or Megan Good. Crawfish has always been a tough food for me to try. It looks like a ghetto version of a lobster crossed with shrimp and for the longest time I have given it the nickname of \"Little Cockroach\". I always felt why would you eat a crawfish on purpose? It's like choosing ground beef when you can have steak. Shrimp has always been my favorite weapon of choose for any of these cajun \"Boiling Crab\" type places, because of the efficient flavor to value ratio. A Crawfish is usually about 9 to 10 bucks a pound and is about 60% shell and 40% meat (I will later find out 90% shell or greater and less than 10% meat). Trust me for a pound of crawfish. You will pay a handsome penny and will not have enough meat to make a crab salad or even an appetizer with crackers. \n\nHow did you find out about Hot N Juicy Crawfish? How does it taste though?? How's the quality? Stop being negative! You might say.\n\nI am guilty of watching Man Vs Food like the majority of all the yelp reviews for this restaurant. Normally, MVF's track record has been fairly poor, but this is different! Who doesn't like Asian flavors crossed with Cajun style? That's like saying you don't like Amerie (so hot!) or Hines Ward (not as hot). I ordered 1 lb Shrimp and 1lb of Crawfish to give Crawfish a try and have my shrimp as a back up, both Hot n Juicy style. \n\nThe shrimp was great of course, although it was slightly under cooked. I think that's because maybe no one ever orders shrimp. It was a nice big size almost Jumbo shrimp sized and it tasted pretty good with the Hot N Juicy sauce, but nothing to jump out of your seat over. Shrimp is a dollar more than crawfish, but its worth it, because it is 95% meat and 5% shell. Time for my first taste of crawfish! At first, I honestly did not know how to eat it. I tried using my shrimp peeling skills, but I looked like a squirrel trying to get a nut. I finally swallowed my pride and asked one of the pretty waitress to help show me how to suck head. Get your mind out the gutter!!! Ha ha.. but that's how you are suppose to eat crawfish. You first suck the head, that's what she said (that's what she said) then you eat the meat. Hmmm.. Good thing this review is PG. The flavor of the juicy coming from the crawfish was a lot better than the shrimp! The taste is very delicious. It's like sipping a hot bowl of pho and some zesty tomato based Italian dish. Maybe that's a bad analogy. Let's say the restaurant smelled and tasted like a cross between a Vietnamese/Chinese restaurant and a Cajun grill. \n\nIf you look around the restaurant you will see nothing, but people with smiles on their faces. This is unusually, because most restaurants I go to most people look impatient or serious. This is definitely a plus! My rating might be a tad bit harsh, but I feel it is truly honest. I do recommend that you give Hot N Juicy a try, only if you get there early and don't mind driving in to \"Chinatown\" (didn't see many Chinese places mostly Vietnamese restaurants, but all Asians look a like right? Don't answer that). If you are from Orange County and are spoiled by the Boiling Crab and other restaurants like it, be warned you may not like this place. There is less spicy and a little less flavor. If you are a Asian Cajun newbie, this will be a great start for you.

I politely asked the server if I could have another bag just to place the one I already had inside because I didn't want to lose all the sauce to my table, and he replied with a horrible attitude, telling me I wouldn't need one because it would be messy anyway. I then replied with, \"Can you just get me a bag like I asked for please?\" And he proceeded to throw his hands in the air, say \"Fine,\" in a very sarcastic tone, and just threw the bag on the table.

Unlike other places similar to this one, the sauces they used for both types we tried were kind of thin in terms of thickness (?), but VERY, VERY, VERY FLAVORFUL. We've been to places that the sauce is almost sandy or chalky, but here, it is like a nice shrimp stock, and we easily and most enjoyably poured it all over our steamed rice, which made it that much better! \n\nCATFISH- \n\nThe catfish basket comes with fries. Fries, who can F those up? Not these guys! Crisp, crunchy, and salty. Perfect the way a fry should be. The catfish, perfectly cooked, comes in a nice cornmeal type of coating that adds a little extra crunch. Only problem is, they only give you about a fillet and a half, if that. I've been to places where they give you almost 3 fillets and that would have to be my only bitch about the fish. \n\nSIDES- \n\nCorn on the cob was awesome. Boiled, Buttery, sweet, and not overcooked. Simplicity at its finest. \n\nSteamed Rice- ditto. Simple, yet delicious. \n\nOVERALL EXPERIENCE- \n\nThe wait was expected.

I was not feeling the Hot N Juicy sauce - it tasted weird with the garlic butter, lemon pepper and whatever else was in there, it was just too much. The garlic butter that was on the shrimp was really good though, we got medium spice and there were some nice chunks of garlic which is my favorite part :) Both the shrimp and crawfish were big - no tiny suckers here which I did appreciate because when you get a tiny crawfish it's quite annoying - all that work for nothing. My favorite part is always the corn because they sit it in the bag with the shrimp and it soaks up all the juice and every bite you get the sweet corn with the spicy garlic buttery taste - ABSOLUTELY AMAZING I'll tell ya!

So this is what everyone's been raving about. \"I mean, how good can buttered-up crustaceans really be for people to wait in line for long periods of time?\" I wondered to myself as I waited in line, albeit I expected a wait for a party of 14 or so. For people who like to get their hands dirty and have an affinity for head on crustaceans, Hot N Juicy is 5 stars for sure. \n\nFor me, however, I don't like to get my hands dirty (especially under my fingernails), and I prefer my crustacean to be deveined and decapitated before I devour them. Nevertheless, I must say I enjoyed Hot N Juicy. I ordered a pound of shrimp in the signature Hot N Juicy special sauce, medium-level spicy. If you order two pounds or more, you get corn and potatoes thrown in the bag. I wish they would include corn and potatoes with one pound orders though...\n\nWith plastic gloves on and paper towels laid out in front of me, I opened the bag of shrimp and spicy steam, and grabbed a shrimp. The worst part about this experience (other than the mess) is cleaning the shrimp before eating. It takes a long time. But I guess it's good to eat slow. The best part about this Hot N Juicy experience is the sauce. The sauce is so tasty- savory, buttery, spicy, garlicky, etc. Make sure to generously dip the meat in the sauce. The sauce is 5 stars, but the shrimp are probably worthy of 3. While some of the shrimp were plump and firm (a sign of freshness), some others were kind of mushy (a sign of age). I detest mushy shrimp!\n\nWhat would make Hot N Juicy perfect is if they offered complimentary bread to sop up the delicious sauce that comes with your seafood order.

This place is WAY over priced, and they do NOT stand behind their food.  We live in a neighborhood of friends, and often get together on a Friday night and order something fun.  Many times it has been Hot and Juicy.  This week we ordered hot and juicy for pickup.  We ordered 13 lbs... 11 lbs of shrimp, and 2 lbs. of crawfish.  The shrimp were inedibly mushy when we got them home.  Luckily, I had defrosted a bunch of king crab legs an lobster tails from Costco.  This higher quality seafood saved the day, and the party.  We called hot and juicy the next day to see if they would refund the money for the shrimp, and that we would gladly bring back the mushy shrimp.  It took 4-5 calls and many hilarious conversations dealing with several of the 20-something children who seem to run the place. One girl said \"for the future, I would ask them to put no more than a lb. per bag.  The shrimp are fickle\"  Really, young child??  As if we are the ones who packed all of the shrimp in one bag!  I'm not at all convinced the amount per bad has any bearing, but she shed all responsibility, saying she doesn't have the authority to give a refund. After a few more calls with other little girls who had no authority, we finally got a hold of a manager, since the owner is apparently too important to deal with his customers.  He offered a 5% discount on our next order.  when we promised to write the story on Yelp, he upped it to 10%.  The problem is, I don't want disgusting mushy shrimp paste nastiness at any price.  The manager said \"I checked with the 'chef' (I'd call him a cook at best) and he said that they were cooked perfectly\".  Did he?  Hahaha!  Of course he said that. I have 10 people, one a sous chef at a restaurant in the Bellagio, who beg to differ.  The manager also practically accused us of lying when we told him we order from there often saying \"well, I don't see an order history on your card\". This, after we had already mentioned that a different person in our group of 10 picks up the food each time. Some of us pay cash.  This place is damned sure not worth the wait, and certainly not worth the exorbitant prices they charge.

The sauce was good but a bit watery. The shrimp was perfect and not over cooked. The service was alright with the waiter coming to check on his here and there. As I was eating one of the remaining shrimp that was left in the bag I noticed a thick black hair on the head of the shrimp. Normally I would think it was just the whiskers or whatever you want to call it from the shrimp but NO it was straight up a pubic hair with the little white thing on bottom tip of it from wherever the hair was from. My friend decided to take the piece of shrimp with pube still on it up to the front and complain. The asshole Caucasian male waiter gave her attitude and claimed it wasn't hair and that it was one of the whiskers from the shrimp. He said that the hair wasn't purely black and that there was a redish color to it which was bull shit.

The host that was talking to us before we got seated walked by and we showed him the hair and even he himself knew it was a piece of hair.

I've eaten at B and C retaurants before...not often..but I have and it was no big deal. But yeah...actually being shut down? Nah. Not for me, because it's seafood. It's up to YOU to make that decision. Most of you may not care, but people like me would want to know if they're going to chow down on shrimp and crawdads.\n\nYou would be surprised how many seafood places get downgraded but I don't often read about closures. Anyways...if you want to still eat here I have an idea that may solve things. Watch the restaurant reports and go after the reinspections because they would have fixed all of the problems. I think that's the best one can do with these cases, if you want to eat there but you're still worried.\n\n==================================================\n\nOriginal update:\n\nI loved the food when I ate there but it's kinda ruined it for ME, because of an old news alert put on Channel 13 action news back in 2009. I just discovered this today as I was researching the art festival First Friday.\n\nI was conflicted about  updating my rating, because it's such old news, but I knew I would have wanted to know anyways, if I were perusing Yelp, so that others could make an informed decision of their own.\n\nI downgraded my rating to A-OK, which is 3 stars. It's not bad, it's not good. I'm more interested in being neutral about this place and letting you decide for yourself.\n\nI had my bad experience in July. The owner addressed the problems in August, to my satisfaction. Then in November they got a C rating with the Health Department.\n\nIf you google the Vegas channel 13 news website for their segment called \"Dirty Dining\", you will find they had run an article on Hot N Juicy  Crawfish about many health district violations from about the time I wrote my reviews.  \n\nThe News channel aquired the records of the health inspection which were archived as PUBLIC records. They publish them as a community service. \n\n-----------\n\nI think it's commendable he fixed the problems listed on the report. Just like he fixed the problems I experienced when I had a bad time there. I admit I'm a little freaked out these problems were there when I was eating there but oh well. I never got sick!\n\nSo the final verdict is this:\n\n1) The food tasted great!\n\n2) They've kept their A rating since the 1 time downgrade to C in Nov 2009 by the health department. That's GOOD! They're most likely safe to eat at and you'll have a wonderful time! It's never happened again, and I believe people and habits can change.\n\n3) After reading their reviews, service still seems to be inconsistent, as the norm.\n\nIt's just my PERSONAL decision to not eat there any more because I can't get their past violations out of my head after reading the report, but that's just ME.\n\nI'm on the lookout for a new place to try when I have cravings for messy seafood.

I grew up in so cal where Boiling Crab reigns supreme, and after moving to Vegas I've had an empty void that needed filling.  I saw the Man vs Food episode and I've read the reviews before stepping in, So I came in excited, hungry and craving crawfish.   \n\nBetween the 3 of us this is what we ordered. dozen raw oysters, catfish basket, 2# shrimp hot n juicy special very spicy with corn and sausage, and 1# crawfish hot n juicy special medium spicy.\n\nThe only complaint about the service was that our raw oysters, which should have been the first thing to come out, showed up on the table last.\n\nRaw Oysters- accompanied by cocktail sauce, lemons, horse radish and tabasco.  I'm a big fan of oysters and these were decent in size (comparable to hama hama), but without any accompaniments they were very bland.  Oysters are suppose to taste like the sea, but these were washed so much they tasted watery and flavorless.  \n\nCatfish basket- breaded in a cornmeal crust served over a bed of french fries and accompanied by ketchup and tartar sauce.  Personally I'm not a big fan of cornmeal breading, but I can't really hold that against the establishment and their recipe.  Catfish was moist and flaky and had a hint of cayenne which perfected the \"Southern\" flavor.  I actually enjoyed this the most.  \n\nShrimp hot n juicy special very spicy-  We ordered this with corn and sausage, both of which were awesome.  the corn was sweet and complimented the spice well. the sausage was spicy and tender and added a bold meaty flavor to the sauce for the shrimp.  the \"hot n juicy special\" sauce isn't as flavorful as I expected, and the \"very spicy\" here is comparable to  \"medium spicy\" at Boiling Crab.  But the flavor was decent and the shrimp themselves were \"okay\".  Not the freshest shrimp I've ever had but they weren't rotten or anything, but what can you really expect in the middle of the desert? \n\nCrawfish hot n juicy special medium spicy-  I'm debating whether or not I should even review this item just because I should have known better than to order this when I already know that crawfish is out of season at this time.  Needless to say we received a previously frozen, bland, rubbery product.  So I'm just going to comment on the sauce, which was the same on the shrimp, but this had significantly less flavor.  Perhaps, more spicy=more flavor, or it could be that there wasn't sausage and corn in this bag to add to the flavor.  \n\nMaybe I'm being a bit unfair because I'm comparing this establishment to Boiling Crab.  However the food was decent and a better alternative to a lot of other restaurants I've been to in Vegas.  If I was asked to come here again, I would, but I don't see myself CRAVING Hot and Juicy Crawfish like I do for Boiling Crab.

You just have to know how to use the little plastic claw tool.  Use one side to make a crack then the other to slice through like scissors through paper.  Ask your server if you need help.  Don't be afraid of the price these are well worth it, trust me you wont be sorry.  \n\nShrimp - If your not going big with the crab legs then these are the best bang for your buck.  Best meat to price ratio and easy to eat.\n\nCorn - Soaks up the sauce like a sponge.  Make room in your gut for this.  Don't Sleep! \n\nFries - Regular or Sweet Potato are both tasty and good sharing choices to break up all the buttery spice from the seafood.\n\nSauce - I prefer the everything mix or whatever they call it here.  I also prefer extra spicy which I wouldn't suggest for most people.  Even spicy has a kick to it.\n\nThey can handle large groups and there is a second one down the street if this one is full.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I came here bc of ADAM RICHMAN.\n\nAdam's been pretty spot on on some of his food tasting adventures.

I had never tried crawfish, but I'm a big seafood lover, so I was excited to try it from what is supposedly the best. You order your seafood of choice by the pound and can find the daily market prices on a board by the kitchen. You choose your choice of seasoning and heat level. I went with the Hot N Juicy special and \"less than mild.\" Even at less than mild, the spice level was making my nose run a little bit (I'll admit, I'm a wimp). Service was okay. We had to ask the waitress for a refill after she passed our empty cups several times. I promise, I'm not a snob, but as a waiter myself, if a customer has to remind me for a refill, I'm not exactly doing my job. Anyways, on to the food:\n\nSnow crab w/ lemon pepper: Absolutely amazing. I don't know how, but their crab was some of the most moist I've had. Huge chunks were easy to pull out since the meat hadn't dried out. Don't forget to dip your crab meat in whatever seasoning you have. It takes it to the next level.\n\nCrawfish w/ Hot N Juicy: Great, but very small. The little bits of meat that you get from each crawfish wasn't very much. As a crawfish newbie, I was surprised, but now I know what I'm in for. If you're here for just crawfish, I'd get at least 2 pounds.\n\nMussels: WOW. Some of the best I've had. I never knew mussels could be so tender! I'm so used to having them dried out/rubbery as they're generally - and unfortunately - cooked.\n\nSides: CORN! Get lots of corn with your seafood of choice. Shake it in the bag, so it gets coated with the seasoning and save it for whenever you're done with your seafood. It will be all sorts of juicy goodness. My only regret: not getting more. The fries and sweet potato fries were perfectly cooked, but beyond that, weren't anything special. Especially if you're trying to eat on a budget, I'd load up on some sides with your seafood, otherwise you'll easily be spending $25+ per person to fill up.\n\nChicken nuggets: As we had a non seafood eater, he got some chicken nuggets which were pretty bad.

Here's my recap:  Parking could be better.  Not a lot of spaces.  Available spaces were a little tight.  Seated immediately upon entering.  The place was pretty busy.  Many tables with chairs, some with booths.  Some booth seating was not accessible because the neighboring table was too close.  Servers were friendly, fast, and knowledgeable.  Menu offered crawfish, shrimp, oysters, clam, lobster, blue crab, dungeness crab, King crab, and snow crab.  All market prices.  Seasoning choices were Louisiana style, juicy Cajun, garlic butter, lemon pepper, and Hot N Juicy special.  Choice of mild, medium, spicy, or extra spicy.  Sides: corn, potato, sweet potato fries, cajun fries, rice, rolls, and sausage.  Also, appetizers were etoufee and a large variety of fried items: calamari, hot wings, soft shell crab, catfish, shrimp, and chicken nuggets.  We ordered two pounds of boiled shrimp: one Louisiana style medium and the other juicy Cajun medium.  Bibs were served first.  The bottom of the bib folds over to make a pocket to catch debris you drop.  We also ordered a side of white rice.  The cook time seemed about right, not real fast, but not too slow either.  Constant line for men's restroom.  Only one person at a time.  Many people waiting to get in to wash their hands after eating.  The food comes out as it is ready, not served at the same time.  I prefer this method.  The shrimp is served in a clear plastic bag and the shells are left on the table.  Plastic table cloth makes for quick and easy clean up.  The shrimp was good sized, hot, and flavorful.  There was a little extra juice in the bottom of the bag which we used to dip our shrimp once peeled.  Also, we ladled some on the rice for a bit of flavor.  The shrimp was head and shell on.  This requires a little work, but is the traditional way to serve, saves the kitchen a bit of time, and leads one to believe the shrimp were alive when cooked.  I lived in Louisiana for many years so I know there is a difference between Louisiana style and Cajun style, but I don't know why they made the distinction here.  Most patrons in Vegas won't know the difference.  The difference here is that Louisiana had more butter and Cajun was more traditional with more spices and less brother allowing the sweet flavor of the shrimp to come through better.  The difference is almost not noticeable, but I prefer their Louisiana style.  The rice was okay.  All in all the food was pretty good.  We really enjoyed it.  On a side note, they did not purge the shrimp.  That is, the gastrointestinal track and the poop were still in the shrimp.  Vegas patrons don't know any better.  Its kind of gross, but I ate anyways knowing that it won't hurt you (otherwise, the place would have been shut down a long time ago).  There were plenty of paper napkins at each table and wet wipes served at the counter and with the bill, but I would have preferred a washing station, similar to those at Cravin Cajun.  You get really, really messy eating boiled shrimp and that stuff is super painful if you get it in your eyes.  They do serve alcohol, but we had tap water, which was served in styrofoam cups.  The server did not ask if we wanted lemon, but she brought out a styrofoam bowl with almost two whole lemons (kind of a waste).  Shrimp was $8.99 per pound and the side of rice was $2.  We really enjoyed this experience and will be coming back.  I tried the crawfish on a previous visit here.  It was the best crawfish in Vegas.  Flavor was right, but a bit small for Louisiana standards.  I love crawfish, but think the shrimp is a better deal because there is much more meat.

But honestly, your opinion on which is better will be based entirely on your own specific tastes and what you're used to. (Ex: I was a big fan of Boiling Crab until I started going to Red Claw a few times and the garlicky taste grew on me. Now I love Red Claw and think Boiling Crab is a bit too salty. Some may think Red Claw is too garlicky.  So it all depends. Red Claw not ever having a wait is the biggest influence in my decision to always go to Red Claw now anyway.)  \n\nMy husband and I were in Vegas and were looking for a place to get good, inexpensive seafood.  Most buffets on the strip definitely don't cut it for me (since seafood is my favorite food), and their seafood is usually not fresh.\n\nSince I love Boiling Crab and Red Claw, I was very excited to find this place on Yelp and we made our way to the original location - as it's a bit more tucked away from the second location, which is a bit more touristy.  I found out later from our server that this location is generally more of a local's spot than the newer location.\n\nSo when we arrived at about 7:30 pm on a Thursday night, we were a bit sad there was no parking in the small lot. But thankfully a group of people left shortly after we circled the lot and nearby neighborhood for parking. We got in and were quickly greeted and told that the wait would be about 20 - 30 mins, though maybe quicker because they were cleaning up some tables.\n\nOkay, so while I was waiting, I noticed a few things. \n1. The mixture of people in the restaurant was extremely diverse.  I'm sure there were at least 10 different ethnicities there!  The age range was also very wide - from young to old.  This was a great sign, as I noticed EVERYONE in the restaurant seemed to be enjoying their food - the food fit, apparently, for varying taste buds.\n2. It was pretty busy in there, but the servers were extremely friendly and were all helping each other throughout the restaurant. No server was strictly confined to only one section or certain tables or customers.  If you stopped any server, they happily got you what you needed. This was honestly rare to see, and I was impressed at how the servers all seemed to interact together as a team rather than stressed out, competitive individuals.\n\nAs far as the food, we got our shrimp, sausage, and corn in the hot and spicy sauce at spicy level. The clams, we got in the spicy garlic sauce.\n\nShrimp - Mostly fresh, juicy, plump, easy to peel and crunchy (sings of freshness).\n\nClams - Were good, though the actual clams were a bit smaller than I hoped they would be. I guess maybe they just use different clams than what I'm used to at Red Claw.\n\nSausage - Were not polska kielbasa sausages as we hoped. :( My husband was very disappointed and didn't like them at all, and he normally loves sausages.  Don't get these. Even though I ate them, I didn't enjoy them.  They were pretty oily and fatty tasting in a bad way.\n\nHot N Juicy sauce - This is similar to Boiling Crab's sauce.  I would say the spicy is pretty spicy, and a little spicier would make it so that you couldn't taste your food very well.  My husband and I have a pretty high tolerance for spicy food, and the spicy here is in between the medium and spicy spiciness at Boiling Crab.\n\nGarlic sauce - We got this sauce spicy, and it tasted fairly similar to the Cajun garlic sauce at Red Claw (though Red Claw uses tons of real chopped garlic and is much better, in my opinion).  My husband liked this sauce over the Hot N Juicy sauce, which is ironic since I'm usually more of the garlic lover.\n\nCajun fries - Fries sprinkled with Cajun seasoning.  The fries were good and crispy and moist on the inside.  The Cajun seasoning is pretty spicy, so be mindful of that if you don't like things too spicy.  They were good fries. :)\n\nOverall, this was definitely a great place for good Cajun-style seafood.   The service was great, and the food really good.  Overall, I'd definitely go here again the next time I'm in Vegas and craving seafood.\n\nBe warned though that your hair, skin, and clothes will smell like your food.

We had to ask for gloves, we had to ask again for our pepper and  limes on the side, which our server never brought, and we even had to ask the next table to please get their server's attention for us after she was done giving them their food orders, just so we could... Ask. Even our tools to crack open our crabs were not the right tools, but after trying to get a server's attention. It was more tiring to wave down a server than tear apart our meals. From the frustration on the service here, I tore the crab legs with my own bare hands and ate like an animal. Tearing it with my own straight teeth!!! Grrr!!! I ended up doing the.. break the shell with my fingers and gently wiggle wiggle the meat out. Several times I showed my great company that I conquered a looooong piece of crab meat Ha haaaa! But then she shows off her piece, which was thicker and longer than mine!!! Oh yeah?!??!!!! I had that Ooo impressed face and nodded my head. We entertained each other... But never once were we checked back upon to see how we were doing or we needed anything. It was literally the worst service for a fun-filled environment. \n\nI heard their other new location has better service, but this experience makes me think twice to even want to give them my business.\n\nThe food was the only thing that made me want to give Any stars to this establishment. The sweet potato fries was excellent in texture and taste. The shrimp, crab, and side of sausage we ordered were full of spice and with the combination of asking limes on the side to make your own sauce.. it tasted refreshing, sweet, spicy, peppery, bitter, and ended with a great bite from the acidity of the limes. Don't forget to ask for those pepper and limes on the side.. makes a great impact with the flavors of the spices that were cooked in with the crab and shrimp. Even if you have to hunt someone down that worked there to get it! I will note that the food deserves high remarks. However, due to the lack of service we received here, it's unfortunate to give it such a low rating. But I must speak the truth and the service here was... non-existence. Damn, DAMN shame if you ask me. It ruined a good meal experience and for us to constantly try to get a server's attention is just bad news. We couldn't enjoy our food and it shouldn't be that way.\n\nAnd for that reason alone... first and last time dining here.

It's better than the shrimp at BC because the shrimp here are more plump and drenched more in sauce! Sometimes at BC it's either you get small shrimp or not enough sauce.

Verdict?\n\nPro: The hot n juicy sauce has a nice kick to it & pretty flavorful and it was nicely smothered over the shrimp. The two half corn on the cob was nearly drenched into the sauce which made the corn sweet from its own juices yet hot/juicy from the sauce. I also got to try my friend's corn fritters because I was curious to see how it tasted and to my liking it was awesome. I like the creamy yet sweet texture that happens when the corn ball is dipped into the batter and then fried. \n\nEh: the \"cajun fries\" ... about them fries, it clearly wasn't cajun fries but merely fries with a splash of cajun seasoning over it. It was not the same... not what I imagined and had experienced at The Boiling Crab. Slightly disappointed, but at least the fries were not bad. \n\nCon: From the outside the crust appears to be crunchy but when I bit into the crust of the fried catfish I was in awe. It doesn't appear to be crunchy but semi chewy or had an interesting texture to it. The catfish was okay not as fresh. \n\nOverall, I didn't come here for the crawfish because I'm not really a big fan of that but I did enjoy some parts of my meal if not all.

The etouffee is yummy, it actually tastes like the one I had in New Orleans. The fries are good, not really spicy though.  We never had the lobster there, just figured crab was their thing.  My only issue is the explanation of the spice level is sort of off. I can eat very spicy food, but for some reason, maybe due to the messiness, I get cuts all over my mouth from the peppers. On my second visit, I even downgraded the spice level, but yet again the same occurrence. I tend to now stay close to mild. Maybe I have sensitive skin, I don't know.

Every time I go I have to ask for ketchup like 6 times and every single time (with exception of that awesome guy server we had) they bring 1 tiny, tiny ramekin.

There was also a large number of people who placed to-go orders, so this place was jumping with business!

I was joking with the guy who gave us the wine before we even had a chance to sit down.

All of the fun, goofy interaction with the staff was the 2nd indicator that we were in a good location.\n\nFinally, the food. You select your seasoning, pick a spice level, & select your items. We opted for the Hot N Juicy Special (combo of Louisiana style, cajun, garlic butter, & lemon pepper), Extra Spicy (Hot Hot Hot!!!), & ordered crawfish, shrimp, lobster, & crab (hooray 4 seafood!). The crawfish comes with 1 head of corn on the cob & a red potato, so you can add additional corn & potatoes to your order as needed. All of the food comes marinated in clear plastic bags, so you literally open up the bags and dig in! Everything was seasoned & marinated to perfection! It was hot, spicy, juicy, & delicious as advertised. The service was also impeccable from the moment we stepped into the place! It was one of the server's last night there so we ended up taking silly pics in her memory since she was working instead of enjoying a moving away party. I think I ended up taking pictures with the entire staff by the time the night was done. Silly me!

We ordered 1lb of crawfish and 2lbs of dungeness crab. I love traveling west to get my dungeness fix!  We ordered both in the mild hot n juicy sauce.  Our waitress, Robin, told us the mild level wasn't spicy and only had a little kick.  For my newbie taste buds, it was quite the slap! The crawfish soaked up a lot more flavor and spices.  I'm not complaining, but for anyone REALLY averse to spiciness, you're in for a surprise! The dungeness on the other hand was perfection.

Coming from Hawaii, we don't get to visit as often as we would like, plus there are so many other eateries in LV that we like to try.  We last ate at this location maybe two years ago - they didn't have fresh dunganess crab or crawfish at that time, so we hadn't gone back since, but after trying the fare at other 'crab' restaurants and not being 'thrilled', we decided it was time to go back to HnJ (we've only been to this location on two previous visits and have never tried the other location down the road in central C-Town).\nI guess you can say that my wife and I are crab people - we love to eat good shellfish and don't mind getting 'up to our elbows' while digging-in, shelling, peeling and devouring good/fresh crab or lobster and now fresh crawfish.  We lucked out on this visit - they had fresh live dunganess crab and crawfish.  So in our excitement with this good news, we ordered one dunganess crab (approx. 1.5#); one pound of snow crab (legs cluster); one pound of crawfish; and one pound of clams - all this prepared in their own 'Hot n Juicy' sauce, medium hot.  Add to that two potatoes and two corn and one bowl of rice.  Talk about plenty of food for two people!?  Our server was Joie - all the servers carry some type of 'walkie-talkie' equipment and can call the kitchen to weigh the individual dunganess crab and let you know right there how heavy your crab is, because everything is sold by the pound.  Joie was super helpful; not only in answering our questions and taking our order, but throughout the entire meal - she would continuously come by our table to see how we were doing and if we needed any more drinks or whatever.\nWife ordered a coke and I ordered a beer - they were at our table in a jiff which was great since the outside temp was in the high nineties.  In good time, they brought each order out in double plastic bags - steaming and super hot.  This was my first experience at eating fresh crawfish and after this, I don't think that I can go back to any of that frozen stuff - totally different in texture and taste.  I would definitely order that again.  My wife kept on commenting how everything was so fresh, meaty and tasty, even the snow crab was solid and sweet.  As you probably have read in earlier reviews, there are no dishes or eating utensils, other than those plier-type crab-crackers and plastic shuckers.  Also, they provide plastic bibs and gloves, but if you don't like eating with your hands and getting crab juice on your arms and face, this may not be for you.  Definitely not a 'prom date' restaurant, but they provide plenty of paper towels and handi-wipes to address this messy, barbaric and fun experience. For us on this visit the food was definitely five stars.\nBut I must add, what made the experience here even more super was the positive atmosphere and overall vibe in this restaurant.  There was another female server and one male server - and I can't help but observe people when I'm out dining.  They both were like our server Joie - super polite (not condescending), always cheery, helping out each other and trying their best to make your HnJ meal a great experience - great food and great service.

Charbroiled Oysters - \"Fresh Oysters charbroiled the Cresent City way, with lots of garlic, lemon and a blend of cheeses.\"  Usually I shy away from any cooked type of half shell oysters suspicious that it is the stuff that they're trying to hide the unfreshness of with cooking it.

My husband and I and I eagerly anticipated dining at this restaurant long before it opened since it is close to home and we were regulars at the restaurants of the two previous occupants, The Grill (miss those salads) and Bistro Divino (miss those pine nut cookies). I hope the third time is a charm for this location since Vegas is missing good Southern cuisine and because the owner, Lola (AKA Beth), is as sweet as the splendid sugary yams you may have the privilege of enjoying if she happens to have some on hand or if you specially order them.\n\nI think this was our 8th or 9th time dining here since it opened last year, and although everything is pretty good, we tend to stick with our favorites. To start we had the craw puppies ($5.99), deep fried morsels of crawfish and cornmeal batter served with an addictively spicy aoli. These are a wonderful way to start the meal and a unique creation of this particular restaurant. For my entree I ordered the shrimp remoulade salad ($8.99), which is the simplest and healthiest dish on the menu, but perhaps also the most underrated. It consists of plenty of perfectly poached shrimp served on a bed of romaine lettuce, accompanied by tomatoes, quartered hard-boiled egg, and lemon wedges (be sure to squeeze them over the shrimp for the proper acidic component). The remoulade dressing made with whole grain mustard and mayonnaise really makes the dish stand out, and the salad is a refreshing antidote to the heavier items that pervade the menu. Ian got the bronzed catfish with grits ($14.99), that he always opts to have blackened rather than the aforementioned bronzed preparation. It is wonderful when you can have catfish that actually tastes good, and Lola's does an excellent job. Ian tends to douse it in the Louisiana Gold hot sauce (the real deal), but it is certainly delicious on its own. The plate hits on all cylinders, and the only change that could be made would be the addition of a bit more cheese in the grits to add some saltiness.\n\nEven though I didn't get it this time, I would also suggest the rich and flavorful gumbo, properly prepared with a dark roux and plenty of sausage and seafood. It's a cup of Southern goodness, though you might want to ask for it extra hot since sometimes is doesn't come out the way I personally prefer which is best described as \"burn the roof of your mouth off hot.\" The baked oyster appetizer is another hit, and please don't forget to ask about those caramelized and gooey yams to round out the meal. The Purple Haze Abita beer ($4.25) is also a must to complete the experience. On the downside, I haven't been too impressed with the po-boys as they are heavy on the bread and the steak wasn't too well-received by Ian's best friend and fellow chef Jason. Boiled crawfish are now temporarily offered on the menu, however, which I anticipate will be terrific and look forward to trying next time so I can compare them to Hot n' Juicy Crawish.\n\nIt is evident from your first visit that Lola's serves up authentic Louisiana fare prepared with love and a genuine desire to make bellies happy. Although the food is not as refined as that of the late Commander's Palace where Ian used to work, you can certainly imagine it coming out of your grandmother's fragrant kitchen, should she happen to be from New Orleans.

They were not drenched in oil and/or butter like the competition.  No need for any condiment.  Lola made it right.  We then quickly flagged our waiter down and politely asked if we may take advantage of the 5lbs deal by adding another 4lbs to the order.

The decor had a new Orleans theme going on but the one thing that caught my eye were the vibrant paintings. You can certainly tell that the owner shows a lot pride and passion form where she is from through the decor.\n\nSo let's get to the nitty gritty \"THE FOOD\". I was disappointed at their beer selection. They had the typical Budwiser, millers, etc. But they only had two Abita beer selections and for those beer lovers Abita is brewed in Louisiana. Although they had only two, much props for having the SOS (save our shore) which was brewed as a charitable beer for the most recent oil spill in the gulf. This again reflected the owners passion to her home town. We went there for the crawfish so we ordered the 5 lb special and after seeing it come out it was well worth the 41.99 price. There were only two of us and the 5 lbs would be good for 4 people. It was time to get in \"caveman\" mode, took the first crawfish ripped off the head and sucked it's delicious juices. The seasoning was perfect, there was a little kick to it but not too spicy where it overwhelms your palette. The tail meat was sweet, with the taste of shrimp and the texture of lobster. \"Crawfish the poor mans lobster\". I didn't care much for the claws so I kindly shared them with my friend who had more patience cracking them open. I skipped on the potatoes and corn that came with the boil because I just couldn't stop eating the crawfish.\n\nOverall my first crawfish boil experience was a very good one and plan to come back to try Lola's other dishes.

Catfish is cooked to perfection; it is some flaky moist goodness. The mussels we heavenly. Easily the best thing on my plate. Crab cakes were good, but nothing to write home about. My friend ordered the shrimp & grits and it was creamy goodness. If you've ever wanted to try it or you're already a fan order it. Now on to dessert. I saw bananas foster on the menu and that is what made me drag everyone here with me.

He is not from Louisiana, but he has eaten at Brennan's in New Orleans. The smells had my mouth watering while we were deciding what to order. My girlfriend and I ordered a large bowl of gumbo and a large bowl of Shrimp \u00e9touff\u00e9e. Presentation was pleasant. Gumbo had okra. I prefer filet gumbo. After discussing the differences with Brennan, he brought out some filet powder for me. Nice touch. I added a little for taste hoping not to make it too thick. It smelled like sassafras.  Both dishes were really good. The gumbo had some odd taste that I could not place. Perhaps it was the sausage. I don't think they use andouille. \u00c9touff\u00e9e is not my favorite but this \u00e9touff\u00e9e tasted like the gumbo I was hoping for, and it had five huge shrimp. Between these two dishes I would recommend the \u00e9touff\u00e9e. Forget the name and imagine it is gumbo. We watched other people's food. Next time we will try the shrimp and grits and the jambalaya. The jambalaya was red like New Orleans style (not like momma makes it). We were full but ordered banana foster for dessert anyway. It came with vanilla bean ice cream. It was light and airy. I was hoping more for thick and rich, but it was pretty good. Even had some small vanilla flakes. The bananas were just right. The brown sugar butter was runny and alcohol was overpowering. I enjoyed it, but will probably try the bread pudding instead next time. Two big bowls and a dessert came to just shy of $40.

The place is tiny, cozy, and adorable; a true hole in the wall. Here is the low-down on the meal:\n\nCrab cake - I am VERY picky about my crab cakes and these were delicious! Lots of crab and not a lot of filler. A beautiful sear on both sides and the lemon aioli was fantastic. The crab cakes were second only to my own.\n\nCraw-puppies - hush-puppies with Crawfish mixed in the batter, very inventive!

The catfish was cooked perfectly, but not exactly what I expected. They even gave me some crispy bread to soak everything up. \n\nMy dining companions had Po-boys and raved about the bread.

My husband had the trout, it wasn't bad but it was a little on the fishy side for me. \n\nSweet Potato Pecan Pie - I wish there was more sweet potato and less pecan, but paired with the chantilly cream it was delicious and I found myself constantly going back for just one more bite.\n\nLola's Famous Bread Pudding - I am not a fan of bread pudding, but my friends forced me to take a bite and it really wasn't bad.\n\nBanana's Foster - The highlight of dessert, we were literally watching each spoonful and silently hating each other for having good taste! It was the best banana's foster I have ever had.

It's on a very weird intersection on Charleston and in the middle of an awkward strip mall-ish building.  I didn't really get it.  Also, thank goodness we made reservations...there were two tables in the entire restaurant (I'm being fecitious).  All in all, the place offers a very cozy, intimate and homely setting.  We were even greeted by Lola Beth herself.  What a treat!  I must add though that it was hard to say that she was completely welcoming.  Our first impression was that she was a nice lady, however, when talking with her at our table later in the evening, her facial expressions really wasn't as welcoming as we thought.\n\nWe decided to order a bunch of items on the menu so that we could put the accolades to the test.  Here's what I tasted:\n\nCrab Cakes- Loved these cakes.  A lot of lump crab meat and not a lot of filler.  The way a crab cake should be.  I loved fact that it sat on a bed of greens and was accompanied with a lemon aioli.  Fantastic combination.  My only criticism is that it was about 6 dollars and included only one cake.  For four people, we ended up getting two orders.  I little pricy in my opinion, but I would pay for that again.\n\nCraw Puppies- To me, I didn't think this appetizer was memorable.  Not something I would choose to order again.  I'm a huge fan of crawfish, but not a fan of hush puppies, so the combination of the two did work for me.  The remoulade did help bring the dish together in the end.\n\nCatfish Po Boy-  I thought this was an excellent choice.  For dinner, I wasn't looking to eat or spend a lot.  Great choice.  For about 11 dollars, I enjoyed a great sandwich.  The bread was grilled nicely.  It wasn't hard or soft where it would become soggy with the lettuce, tomatoes and mayo.  It was perfect.  What sealed the dish for me was the side of fries I had.  Super crispy and super homeade, which made it that much more better.\n\nSweet Potato Pecan Pie- We did decide to add chantilly cream and that was what made this dessert good. I'm not a fan of pecans. Because of that, I didn't really find myself going back for more.  My hope was that the chantilly cream would help mask the taste of the pecans, but unfortunately, it did not.\n\nLola's Famous Bread Pudding- Now with bread pudding, I am a HUGE fan. This dessert did NOT disappoint.  SOOOO delicious.  I found myself fighting for the last bit of bread pudding with my friends.  The run praline sauce was superb and although it wasn't offered on the menu, our server was nice enough to suggest also adding the chantilly cream on this dessert.  Such a fantastic combination!\n\nBananas Foster- Although I didn't admit this to my friends at the time, I had never tried bananas foster before.  This was an \"AH-MAZE-ING\" first experience.  C'mon!  Brown sugar coated bananas with vanilla bean ice cream.  How could you go wrong!  Each spoonful presented a new pleasant feeling that just ended the evening with a positive experience.  What a great dessert!\n\nAll in all, I'd say I had a great time.  I was accompanied with three wonderful friends and discovered a \"dive-type\" restaurant that offered, for the most part, wonderful Cajun Connections, as their website states.

I have to say , I am not a huge purveyor of Southern cooking, however, after reading yelper Michelle W review of the place, figured we had to give it a shot.  Had clients in town from Italy and France and one of my colleagues wanted to try Rhythm Kitchen and so I suggested Lola's.\n\n1.  Quaint - When you are traipsing around the Charleston area, me thinks the last thing you are going to think about is quaint, cute, cool.  This place is all that and has character. Small, few tables, small bar, and it has just enough of whatever it is to make it just right.\n\n2.  Service - Dominic was there when we entered waiting for our guests. Very nice, knowledgeable, gave us the scoop on the wine he preferred and also on the food.  They set up our table nicely and when we had to add one more, they were very accommodating. We had a party of 9 in here and they took care of us.  I think the place serves 20-25 total?\n\n3.  Food - I was looking to give our out of towners a unique experience to try something uniquely American.  So this is the place we chose.  \n\nCrab Cakes and Craw Puppies - The crab cakes were very substantial, flaky, moist and tender. I enjoyed it.  It was one per order, however, as they are decent size, we asked for each to be cut in two pieces and we ordered enough to share. Ordered craw puppies for the table, never having this before.  Deep fried seafood is the best I can describe this.  Not greasy and bite size tasty bits of seafood. Nice.  Each is the size of a small meatball, 5 per order, so we split two orders.  \n\nJambalaya - to me, the right blend of spice, rice, seafood. I also ordered the shrimp as an addition and it was just right. Juicy and hits the spot.\n\nSalmon and Sweet potato fries - I think this was the only let down.  The fries had such great flavor yet the salmon was very dry  Dry fish is not too bueno, so this was  of a downer.\n\nGumbo -Seafood soup like bouillabaisse or cioppino.  I did not have it but one of our friends did. It looked really, really good.\n\nEtoufee - I thought this was something a bald buy wore as he got older?  Perhaps I will need one soon.  Naw, this is a dish similar to the gumbo, just that it is thicker and more like a stew. Whereas the gumbo has seafood, this one here has either shrimp or something else, was the choice, but it was not  mixed like the gumbo.  Now I did not order this, but man did my friend enjoy it. Very nice.\n\nSweet Potato Pecan Pie a la mode with ice cream - YOu have to come for the desserts.  This is what the wifey and I ordered, and it was really great. I am going to go back for their Banana Foster Bread Pudding.  Don't be shy, order the dessert!!!\n\nGK says, check this place out for sure! I enjoyed it as a unique dining place.

SHE LITERALLY ROLLED HER EYES...and said \"IT'S A LITTLE WINDY, BUT IF YOU LIKE THAT THEN..\" ummm ma'am take us outside please!\n\n2.This was our first time there and my bf was having trouble deciding so we took a little longer to order. Her coming EVERY 5 seconds didn't help. If I were her, I would've maybe suggested an item on the menu or even ask if she could help in any way..NOPE.\n\n3.I ordered the crawfish hush puppies to start and jambalaya with added shrimp. My bf ordered the fried shrimp with the fried oyster, and crab cake. He asked for gritz and greens on the side. The crawfish puppies were interesting.I don't eat crawfish much so I'm not exactly sure how they supposed to taste so I'll just describe what it tasted like.Tart.The jambalaya came and LOOKED very promising.That jambalaya HURT MY FEELINGS. It was the mushiest, no flavor having jambalaya I have EVER TASTED. This jambalaya was the WORST ever. It taste like tomato and mushy rice. The chicken was very small and the shrimp just had no taste to it. My bf's food was COOKED perfectly.His fish was crunchy on the outside, flaky on the inside. He took his first bite and said \"It needs A LOT of hot sauce\" I tasted that fish and AGAIN no flavor! I mean..NONE I was soooooooo confused because Cajun food usually has SO MUCH FLAVOR..He used half their bottle of hot sauce to give that fish flavor.He taste the grits and actually sent them back because they were so bad. Just so you know my bf isn't the type to send food back. He rather just pour a lot of salt and pepper on it and \"make it work\" Needless to say, after that HORRIBLE meal and the $70 bill we were done.\n\nOn the car ride home, I was sad.

Notice, I said Creole, NOT cajun.  There is a difference between the two.  Cajun food tends to be HOT and spicy.  Creole food is just seasoned to perfection and does not burn your mouth.  It just gives you a really nice feeling and it is hard to quit eating it is so delicious.  Lola's has this down.  The Gumbo is tasty, seasoned well, not overseasoned and not spicy hot.  Just right.

You just can't get french bread like that anywhere else.  I only wish they had a \"seafood gumbo\" with crab and shrimp.  That would be really good.  I will definetly be back again.  Remember, if you are looking for Cajun food, this is not the place, but if want Creole, get to Lola's.  Also, Have desert!  The bread pudding is amazing.  We shared it.  Next time I might get my own.  Will definitely go back and have told all my friends about it too.  Remember. of you are looking for HOT and SPICY cajun food, go somewhere else.

I look forward to savory dishes and bourbon-based cocktails. But Lola's bananas foster bread pudding is one of those desserts I would publicly humiliate myself for. So let's start with dessert and backtrack.\n\nI'm not a fan of bread pudding-I guess I've just never had a good one. Lola's was a game changer. Game. Changer. It was rich without being heavy with a distinct banana flavor that wasn't overpowering. Why wasn't banana the main player in a dessert with the word \"banana\" in the title? Oh because it was swimming in the most delightful brown sugar/butter sauce concoction that you've ever had. The first taste was one of those I-can't-believe-I'm-going-to-cry-in-a-restaurant moments. THAT good. The bread pudding was topped with a quality vanilla bean ice cream that just melted into the bread pudding in the most satisfying way. Best dessert in town- I really dare you to find something better.\n\nThis was our second visit to Lola's and unlike our first visit, we had reservations (which I recommend). The restaurant is tiny with a nice sized patio which can of course only be utilized when the sidewalk isn't smoking from the summer (see March-November) heat. The staff is friendly and passionate about the food. They don't just give recommendations, they tell you what they like and why they like it.\n\nThe house salad is incredible! Romaine, candied pecans, mandarin oranges and a tangy-sweet vinaigrette all topped with a sprinkle of pepper and cayenne pepper-I did not know salad could taste like that. It can be ordered with chicken, salmon or shrimp, I believe, which would make for a good lunch or dinner salad, but it's a five star salad without the protein. I had etouffe on my first visit which is basically a gravy/stew with seafood. I'd never had it before, so have nothing to compare it to, but if you like the sting of spice, go for the etouffe. The heat didn't detract from the deep concentrated flavors and they didn't skimp on the shrimp! Second time around I ordered the shrimp and grits and I'll never look at grits the same again. It was more like a custard than grits and they used gruyere cheese-FLAVOR TOWN! Again, no skimping on the shrimp here and they were a good size and perfectly cooked. The portions here are proportionate with price because you're not getting some chain restaurant slop cooked by someone who knows nothing about the cuisine.  When food is made with love, it doesn't need to  be served in offensively large portions.\n\nLike I said, reservations are a must. This is a solid local's spot with a lot of regulars and it fills up quick. Our waiter on our first visit said that the lunch time traffic is always heavy as they get a lot of people from the downtown area so reserve, reserve, reserve! \n\nLola's serves up down home favorites (and a KILLER salad) in a cozy setting.

I'm not here to present one today, as Lola's didn't provide me anything worthy. I've really enjoyed all of the dishes I have tried over the past couple years, but never even considered getting a burger there until someone suggested it months ago. And as the rule typically goes for me, if only one person in this city has suggested the burger there, it's probably for a reason.\n\nLola's is a really tight space in the Holsum Lofts building on Charleston at the 15 next to a now-abandoned antiques store. The restaurant has a bunch of two and four seat tables, 6 seats at the bar plus another little 2 seat high top, and a bunch of seating outside during the warm months. It can get very packed very quickly during lunch and dinner so either get there early or prepare for a bit of a wait if you choose to come during peak times, I think they may also take reservations. The parking lot sucks and also fills up quickly so keep that in mind if you're running late. Their menu features everything you can expect from a restaurant with the title \"A Louisiana Kitchen\"; crab cakes, catfish and grits, po'boys, bread pudding, etc. Everything I've had here has always been rich and tasty, so when someone suggested the burger I got a bit excited. How can a place that does nearly everything right screw up a burger?\n\nLola's burger is a never frozen, lean beef patty with lettuce, tomato, mayo and mustard. Knowing what typically gets served here, I was shocked to see a puny burger show up in front of me. The meat had ok flavor, but no char and totally overcooked beyond the medium rare I ordered. The bun was thin, small and way too generic. The tomatoes were not very red and fairly weak, the mayo and mustard were barely present. Overall there was nothing juicy about this as their online menu claims, and I really questioned whether I need to try a burger at every single place in town just in case they have that one secret amazing burger. I'm starting to think the answer is no. Everyone can put a burger on their menu to satisfy that one odd person in the group that doesn't want to eat the amazing Louisiana food that's served there, or the pizza that everyone else is getting, but if it's nothing great then what's the point? There are certainly exceptions to the rule, but I need to start limiting myself to restaurants that I know for sure provide something at least somewhat worthy of reviewing.\n\nThe fries on the other hand were actually pretty good. Not sure if they were entirely fresh but cooked really well; skin on with a decent amount of seasoning. There were lots of little crunchy bits, but I wish there was a bit more of the larger pieces as there weren't too many actual fries to chow down on with my burger. My meal came to $12.42 with an iced tea and an extra dollar for my not completely melted swiss cheese, basically far too much for a burger meal of this caliber. I don't think I need to reiterate that you shouldn't come here for the burger; there is plenty of great Louisiana style food here that you can't go wrong with, so just stick with that.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "The gumbo was GREAT!

Very very good!! This was the highlight of the night for me!  The top of the ice cream had a slight creme brulee like crisp on it too!\n\nSmall complaint.  When we saw that we received the wrong intended dessert, we told the server and she ordered us the right one.  We had a bite or two of the wrong dessert thinking there might be some bread pudding hiding in there, but we quickly realized it was the wrong order.  They never took the wrong dessert off the table, so we ended up picking at it a bit, but still left at least 70% of the dessert on the table.  When the tab came through, we got charged for both.  I didn't complain or say anything, but the server asked us if we ate any of the wrong item, and I said we picked at it, but left most of it on the table.  She then offered to pay half of the plate costs $4 of the $8...\n\nIf this was almost at any other restaurant in town, the wrong order would have been comped.  If I would have raised a fuss, it would have been comped.

The wings (level 10 is like a level 5 of Thai spice) for sure made with a homemade Louisiana style sauce. \nCrab cake- yum. \nFettuccine Alfredo with blackened chicken was for sure from scratch and had a hit of Cajun flare. \nShrimp Charlotte, angel hair with light sauce, mushrooms and shrimp. Spicy and a tad dry but the flavor & a squeeze of a lemon made up for it. \nSecondly- their effort. Scatterbrained or not, everyone there was truly busting their butts! I can't wait to return for some gumbo and catfish. \nOh and also make a reservation- this place is packed for a reason.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Terrible service!

I grew up in New Orleans and still love the NOLA food, but it is hard to find good stuff out west.  I found out about this place from Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives on TV.  It looked good so I added it to my list.  It only took me a year to get down to Lola's, but I did finally get there!\n\nWe went for lunch and were pleased by the menu.  It offered a lot of yummy NOLA specialities and things I remembered from home, especially the Po Boys.  Let me tell you, nothing beats a good shrimp Po Boy in my book, so you know I ordered that!  We also got a catfish Po Boy, because that is the second best sandwich in the world, if I do say so.\n\nWell the food came out and it was good, a little better than average, but didn't blow my socks off.  We ate everything on the plate, meaning our entire sandwich each and all of our fries, but were still a little hungry.  We didn't have time for dessert because we had a crazy 18 month old with us, so we didn't get to sample any of the desserts, which did look good, but not enough to deal with our crazy monkey.\n\nIt seems that for the price we paid for the sandwiches ($12 each) that we would have been full after eating every single scrap of food on them.  I know that Lola's imports their bread and seafood from NOLA, so I am sure that is why the prices are a little higher than I would expect, especially for Downtown.  I think it would be worth it if you got an extra piece of fish on each sandwich and maybe an extra piece of yummy Gulf shrimp to make the price a little more reasonable.  We actually were talking to a neighboring table a lot and they had the same comment about the price that we had and they had order entrees like red beans and rice and gumbo.  So the food was good, but a little high for what you actually get, in my opinion.\n\nI would have given Lola's a 4 star easily, but our service was rather lackluster.  We were seated for 10 minutes before our server came over to us.  We had actually had more interaction from a server in the next section because my daughter, the crazy 18 month old mentioned above, was flirting with him and blowing him kisses.  I never get any attention from anyone unless she is around!  Anyway, if we had had him for a waiter, I think we would have had a better time, but our server was just swamped or something.  We hardly saw her and when we did, she seemed not to really care about us and just bothered with us.  I am not sure why because we are super nice and great tippers, oh well, her loss.\n\nSo we will probably give Lola's another shot next time we are Downtown and hopefully we get a better server.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 5, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "Crawfish and seafood gumbo...order it.

I'm rounding up by giving them 2 stars.  Let's review this by separating the kitchen from the waitstaff.  Note to Lola:  You were at a wine tasting, and your staff does a horrible job when you are not there.  I'm sorry for the detailed review, but I'm hoping that Lola actually sees this and responds.  \n\nFood:\nDrinks:  Interesting beers in bottles.  Nothing on tap.  \nApps:  Crab/artichoke dip was good.  Crawfish puppies (hush puppy knock off) was not worth the money or the calories.  The salad is unimaginative and tasteless, but at least it wasn't brown lettuce.  \nEntree:  a pound of crawfish, ordered medium, came out with the appetizers and was cold when we wanted to eat them.  They remade them for us, but it was so spicy and salty that it was impossible to enjoy.  The crawfish are pre-cooked, instead of being cooked to order, as told to us by our server.  They had blackened salmon on the menu and tons of po' boys, so I asked if they could make me a salmon po' boy...no dice.  Apparently, no one in the restaurant was willing to \"take the risk\" of changing the menu while Lola was out of the restaurant.  Anyway, the blackened salmon was well-cooked, but over-seasoned.  I like spicy, but you lose the flavor with this amount of blackening spice.  I asked for a side of sweet potato fries, but I can't tell you if they taste good or not (see the service comments).  Debris po' boy was all hype, and not up to DDD (curse you Guy Fieri).  The meat was good, but the gravy was cold.  The catfish po' boy was solid.  The soft shell crab po' boy was a nice sized chunk of crab, breaded and deep-fried.  Too much breading, too much bread, too much mayo.  \n\nTotal bill $150, and I'm going to make some food now that I'm home.  I'm hungry and irritated.  \n\nService:  \nAmbiance:  We sat outside, so some things are harder to control, but the entire patio was blinded by the setting sun, but no employees did anything about it, even after we asked.  I had to go take one of the restaurant umbrellas from the side of the patio and position it to block the sun.  This helped enough tables that I received a large round of applause.  (We weren't the only table suffering.)  Flies all around our table too.  \nServers:  Our server had little knowledge of the menu, since she was a vegetarian.  Our water glasses were never filled until the end of the meal when someone asked for some...and she only filled that one glass.  The crawfish entree for one of our group came out with appetizers, with no response from the server.  She acknowledged that they shouldn't have come out so soon, but left them there and walked off.  They took my silverware away with my salad, so I had none for my piece of salmon.  I waved politely to get someone's attention, but one waitress in particular (Beth - blonde curly hair) looked right at me on three separate occasions and walked away.  (note:  Beth was not our waitress.)  They brought me the wrong side dish (no big deal) and made me sweet potato french fries (which the waitress had recommended).  And I had asked for a side of BBQ sauce, because it is the greatest condiment in the world...The waitress asked if I wanted the house-made signature BBQ sauce or the stuff they get from a bottle...duh.  5 minutes later, the fries were still pretty hot, and I reminded the waitress for the BBQ sauce.  So 15 minutes later the fries were warm, I asked a 3rd time for the BBQ sauce.  After 35 minutes, my fries were cold and I had given up on them entirely.  My GF asked the waitress \"what happened to the BBQ sauce?\" and she brought me out a tiny cup of it, and told me it was \"the junk from the bottle\" since it takes too long to make the house-made sauce.  Oddly enough, I didn't feel like eating it.  When it was time for our check, we gave them our credit cards and waited for 15 minutes.  When no one picked up the cards to process them, I walked them in and gave them to a waiter (again, not our own).  10 minutes later, as I came back from the restroom (filthy), I saw our check and walked over and asked a waiter (again, not ours) if anyone could please run the cards so we could leave.

Well, maybe not THE New Orleans.  We went to Lola's to celebrate over lunch.  I was excited to try it.  I have wanted to for quite some time but haven't really had the chance until now.  I tried a while back and was met with disappointment as on that particular day the parking lot had absolutely zero parking spots available.  Today was another story though.  There was parking and there were many seating options outside.  So the four of us were seated under the canopy just close enough to the entrance to barely hear the music playing over the sound of traffic on nearby Charleston Boulevard.  We were asked if we had a reservation but we did not.  It did not matter on this day as we were seated right away.  It took a few minutes for each of us to decide on our lunch for the day but once we did the waitress was right there and took our orders.  I chose the Mama's Red Beans and Rice.  I was asked if I wanted extra sausage but I turned that down.  In hindsight I perhaps should have considered the extra.  My very wide but somewhat shallow bowl of food showed up with only one piece of sausage resting on the scoop of rice.  The menu says it containes andouill and smoked sausage.  Something was missing from this equation.  Regardless, it was actually very good.  The beans were tender as could be.  The soupy sauce was well seasoned with just the slightest hint of spicey heat.  The bowl of coleslaw on the side was good with the cabbage and bell pepper liberally dressed creamy style.  But the stand out for me was the French bread served on the side.  It was buttered and grilled to the point I could see the marks from the grill grates.  This gave the bread a subtle smokiness not unlike a fresh grilled burger.  No doubt it was picking up the flavors of grilled meats past.  A small scoop of beans with the lovely ham hock meat on a bite of bread was just the way to go.  Overall I am happy with my first experience.  I wish I had been given more than one slice of sausage but as a co-worker pointed out to me, I ordered red beans and rice and that is what I received.  I acn say with relative certainty that I will be back at some time to try perhaps the sausage and chicken jambalaya.  Also, the desserts sound insane.  They have bread pudding.

It needs experience, patience and LOTS AND LOTS of love.  Lola's has this in spades so I ordered the Etouffee.\n\nThere are a few dishes I NEVER order out, like Moussaka, Lasagna and Etouffee.  These are dishes that personify their prospective ethinicities and are rarely worth eating in a commercial setting.  Well Lola's Etouffee is as good as it gets.  As soon as I took that first spoonful in my mouth I was transported back to New Orleans and their amazing cuisine.  The crawfish perfectly prepared, the sauce was spicy and the vegetables were chunky and fresh.  It is served with rice and a basket of freshly grilled bread.  The bread dipped into the sauce is amazing.  I skipped the rice and just used the bread because it tasted to wonderful together.\n\nHubby loved his BBQ Shrimp dish and devoured the entire dish before I was even halfway finished with mine.  He said the shrimp was also cooked perfectly and the sauce was fabulous.  He loved dipping the bread in his sauce too.  We also had crab cakes and crawfish puppies to start with, both were EXCELLENT.  I would go back for those crawfish puppies any day of the week.\n\nUnfortunately we were stuffed and avoiding the sugars, so we did not indulge in the desserts, but I think we will have to make an exception next time and have some.\n\nSide note for my doggy lovers, they do accept dogs on the patio as long as they are leashed and well behaved.  Also rumor has it they are opening a second location in Summerlin at the end of the summer.

Most of the seafood are sold at market price, but they tend to stay between $10-$12. Corn are .75, potatoes are .60, and the half portion of sausage was $2.75. The fried shrimp were not a favorite. The cornmeal batter is great for crispiness, but I could barely spot any shrimp. It end up feeling like I was eating friend bread. Beers are cheap for a restaurant. $2.75 for Bud, Bud Light, and Miller Light. $3 for Heineken, Heineken Light, Corona, Corona Light, Sapporo, and Blue Moon.

What a way to spend a Saturday.  \n\nOMG!!  Ultimately, although I wanted to eat more, I refrained from pigging out.  I stopped eating after I ate three pounds of crawfish...and yes I'm consoling myself with the fact that three pounds included the shells...yes, that's it!  And...no I didn't eat the shells.  So I really only ate maybe a pound or so of actual crawfish meat.  Anyway, the first two pounds were in the medium Cajun boil served with a corn cobbette and a potato.  The boil was flavorful with a light heat and the crawfish were of good size.  When I was done, I ordered another pound of crawfish in the spicy hot and juicy boil.  Great flavor, particularly with the garlic touch.  And those mudworms were large!  They looked like mini- lobsters.  I actually ate the claw meat, something I generally don't do given their small size.  After all, there is a limit to just how much work I want to do for a meal. Now, I know to just order the spicy boil flavors since I generally like foods with a high heat.  Before I forget, the sweet potato fries were good too.  I liked that our food server kept the coke cups full and the staff checked in often. \n\nMy companion ate the fried shrimp and the chicken wings with potato fries.  While he ate everything because he was hungry, he didn't particularly care for it.  I'm thinking that figures since the house specialty is the crawfish.

I didn't mind that because I felt like I got my money's worth food wise, but wouldn't hold it against them if they added some steamed broccoli or something to the menu.\n\nAlso, it's very, very messy eating.

Ladies, bring a hair tie because there's nothing more distracting than tossing your hair out of your face every few minutes! I would even suggest wearing clothes that you may not care about because while they give you a generously large bib and gloves, there's no guarantee that some of those delicious sauces and juice won't go flying on your clothes in an eating frenzy. The attire is very casual though-so much so that I didn't feel bad about wearing pocketed sweatpants.\n\nI did think the lack of continuity in service did warrant knocking off two stars. I watched as people came in and were left unattended for extended periods of time and it was incredibly awkward. Seriously-hire a hostess for busy nights!

We asked the taxi driver to take us to the original location but he didn't.  I was a bit disappointed. As soon as we were seated, that disappointment disappeared.. The table is covered in a big piece of plastic, roll of paper towels, and menus. Makes for easy cleanup. Trust me on that...Catlin was our server and she was the sweetest, nicest person ever! I had never had Crawfish before, she explained the menu, the process, and how to eat them to us. They serve most of the seafood by the pound with the exception of the shrimp, you can get them in half pound. You pick the seasoning (Louisiana Style , Juicy Cajun , Garlic Butter, Lemon Pepper , Hot N Juicy Special(which is a combo of all of the seasonings)), then you order a spice level (I am a total spice whore, the hotter the better). They offered mild, medium, spicy and extra spicy. They serve it in a steaming bag that is opened on the table for you to enjoy. Catlin suggested that we go with the medium as it was hot and it builds as you eat. She said to try it and if we wanted it hotter we could order something else. We started out by ordering a pound of Crawfish cooked in the HNJ special seasoning with medium spice. OMG I cannot begin to tell you how good this was. The flavor makes my mouth water as I am typing this. The medium spice was perfect and was hotter than most mediums you have probably eaten. It was so good we ordered rolls to dip into the leftover sauce. And then the debauchery began.. Once we were about half way thru we decided to order the snow crab legs in the same flavor and spice level. Chunks of garlic on the crablegs....it was heaven.\nOh no, I am not finished...we then ordered 10 fried shrimp. These shrimp were butterflied, cooked in a catfish type batter. We also ordered the Cajun fries (which we couldn't even finish) but all of it was the best seafood I think I have ever had. Needless to say our table was strewn with shells, bags and lots of paper towels (yes us girls got our chow on, somethin fierce!) the whole bill came to under 60 dollars (including beers with dinner).

It was probably the worst waste of $30 I've ever spent and just thinking about it upsets me. You get a huge crab with big legs and you crack it open and the meat is mealy.

They had a large banner out front advertising the fact that the restaurant was featured on Man vs. Food.\n\nI really wanted to like this place because come on, we're in VEGAS, there are so many good restaurants we could have had our farewell Vegas meal at...so I did not want to be disappointed.\n\nThere was a bunch of random broken parts in our bag....Hot N Juicy needs to toss those pieces out!

They did deliver a fresh dungeness crab; although, at a price. A price you wouldn't know if you didn't think to ask up front.\n\nNow, apparently according to some folks, if you see a price for crab or lobster on a board you assume it's per pound. Sure, maybe I've been living under a rock but if I see a price next to dungeness crab and there isn't \"/lb\" or \"per pound\" next to it, I'm going to think it's the price of the crab.  If you look at the menu it says \"market price\" but I've never read anything in economics advising that the unit of measure is always by pound. \n\nI've ordered seafood at many places, fish markets, casual and fine dining, from across the country and I have never been uncertain about what I was going to pay at the end. For example, at R & D in Newport Beach, they list fish as \"market price\" but the server will tell you exactly what the whole plate will cost.\n\nNow, I can't say what would've happened if I had known it was per pound and asked the server how much it's going to weigh, but it's a nasty surprise to somebody who didn't know how \"these places\" work. Nobody should have to make this mistake just to find out. Would it be that difficult to add per pound to the board or menu?

One lb in medium and 1 lb in mild. My friend ordered 2 lb of crawfish in medium as well.

I had to slow myself down and savor the moment. I didn't want it to end. I also ordered corn, which was marinating in the sauce. So tasty!  The corn itself was boiled to perfection, then sitting in the sauce was even better! Medium is hot if you dip the meat in it like I did. The waterworks began because it was a bit hot, but good.

Finally, a restaurant that KNOWS spicy. Be ready to get down and dirty! They provide you with bibs, plenty of paper towels, and wet naps because you will be splashing sauce everywhere and using a lot of your hands.\n\nI recommend the shrimp and lobster. Of course the lobster is the most expensive; however, once in a while it's SOOO worth the money. The clams are fantastic as well. My regular order is a pound of shrimp and a pound of snow crab legs EXTRA EXTRA spicy with 2 corn on the cob, a bowl of rice, and occasionally the order of lobster but that's rare because I don't want to spend a fortune every time I'm there $$$. The Hot n Juicy special sauce is by far my favorite, but the cajun is fantastic as well. I usually do one of each. They also have fresh oysters for appetizers, and you can also choose from blue crab, king crab, mussels, and of course, crawfish for your main course ;). \n\nThe service is always great because the staff works as a team, so there is almost always somebody to refill your water, grab you more plastic gloves, etc.. \n\n\n**HERE'S AN IMPORTANT TIP!**: you WILL stink of garlic after this meal. Possibly for over a day! The food is worth it, but don't go here before your work shift, the gym, or a night out with friends because nobody will appreciate your stench! A thorough shower afterwards is crucial!\n\nOverall, I love visiting Hot N Juicy for the fun environment, quick and attentive service, the killer spicy cajun flavors, and to get full off of a ton of seafood!

It was about 9pm and I understand it is a loud and fun place, at least for other patrons.  It wasn't just noisy in there, many people were yelling, hurting my ears.  This was probably because many were partying and partially drunk from what I observed.  That's all fine, not my cup of tea but probably lots of fun.\n\nI ordered the shrimp, clams, and lobster, all Hot N Juicy style.  I also added rice and corn.  The corn was actually very tender and the tastiest corn on the cob I have ever had - yummy.  The shrimp were whole, tasted good, but were quite difficult to peel.  I had to use a tool which I normally never have to.  That was probably just my bad?\n\nThe clams were large and tasty but I kept getting a little sand and even more tiny pieces of broken shell in the bites..  It is such a turn off to chomp down on a clam and bite on something so hard you are afraid you chipped a tooth.  I had to bite down very carefully because it kept happening.\n\nThe lobster was a live and whole specimen.  It was nice and large.  But it had to be the worst lobster I have ever tried to chew.  I've had my share of tough, overcooked lobster but the tail was like a piece of rubber.  Claw meat was just the opposite, it seemed to be missing texture or had one a little like clay.  Live lobster cooked properly is usually quite tender, softer than frozen.  I usually fight through such difficulties but I swear I simply could not chew this beast.  I only took a small bite of the tail but had to leave almost all of it because I just couldn't chew it apart in my mouth.  I've never even had really hard rubbery scallops this bad.  It honestly reminded me of trying to chew whale blubber (Alaska Native dish) or maybe a hard rubbery piece of Abalone.  Even though it was obvious almost the entire tail was still on the table (eat out of bags, off the table, no dishes style) they just offered me 10% discount.

I did enjoy the corn and rice. Come on, I had to have some rice with the proteins!\n2nd experience:\n\"Dude, I think the guy at the front is hitting on you.\" Our waiter proceeds to act awfully friendly to my co-worker. We picked on him for the rest of the evening. It was cute!\nI was in town for a convention for work. My boss treated us to dinner here. I was so excited since I already knew what to expect. We all ordered our own crab and shared shrimp and sides. The Hot N Juicy special sauce all the way! I learned the ways of H&J.\nLast notes:  If you're in it to win it, go for the H&J special sauce mild. Medium to me seems too spicy, but that's just me.

The hostess was super cheerful and friendly and gave us bibs and a fresh roll of paper towels as she sat us. Our server came shortly after and asked for our drink orders and asked if we had ever been there before and we said no so they could explain how it works to my friend. Our server was very thorough she took the time to explain the different shellfish and the different seasonings. We decided on 1lb of shrimp each with the hot n juicy seasoning but hers extra spicy and mine just mild. I like spicy things but that mild gets my nose running! We also ordered corn sauasage and potato in our bags. And we got an order of cajun fries.

The answer is, \"Finger licking good!\" And let me tell you, Hot n Juicy is the definition of finger licking good cause I will always be licking my fingers afterwards! \n\nThis place is delicious. I moved out of Las Vegas for a period of time and whenever I visited this city, I always always always have to eat at Hot n Juicy at least ONCE. It is always a must! The flavors are unique and different. No, I didn't come here due to \"Man vs. Food\" .. in fact, I never watched that show. I came here because I heard it was good and their first location was ALWAYS packed! The wait is always humongous! \n\nAnd yes, there are actually two locations and this one is their second location on Spring Mountain. It's newer so the decor is more modern and the ventilation should be a whole lot better than their first building. \n\nSo you don't like crawfish? That's fine. I don't really have a preference for them either. In fact, I think they're not really worth it. Each crawfish doesn't have much meat ... you'll be eating a few tons before you get full! Why? Well, Hot n Juicy sells it by the pound ... so with the little amount of actual edible goodness you get that comes in the huge clanky shells, you don't get much. But no worries! There is SHRIMP on the menu!! Of course, there's crab and whatnot on the menu too but that's not my concern. SHRIMP is my recommendation and it will fill you up for sure!!\n\nSo what they do is sell seafood by the pound. You get to choose a sauce and the spicyness level between mild and extra spicy. The shrimp is cooked in the sauce and they bring it to you in a plastic bags. Yes, it's different. Yes, you may not like being served food still in the bag. Sure, you may not like using your hands and they got plastic gloves for you folks. But it is YUMMYLICIOUS. Prepare to get messy ;) It's honestly worth a try ... get adventurous once in a while. You never know what you'll come across!\n\nI typically order 1 lb of shrimp. Hot n Juicy special. Add corn to that. As for the spicyness level, it depends on my mood. I have tried mild, medium, and spicy. Mild is the best and their mild is not the traditional mild. It's actually spicier than what people would consider mild. It is delicious with a little kick to it that gives it an oomph. Medium, to me, was very similar to the mild ... no real big difference. Now, spicy, that's the REAL kicker! It was SO GOOD. SO SPICY. SO FLAMING HOT. But honestly, go for the mild. \n\nI usually also order the cajun fries. They used to make them as regular fries with cajun powder on top but now they've incorporated the two? Who knows how they go about it but it's pretty good. \n\nSo their sauces have a lot of garlic in them. You'll be eating and smelling garlic all night. Be sure you're a garlic lover! You'll even take the smell home so be careful of what you wear and what you bring in! Make sure they're all easily washable :D \n\nAnd a tip...if you're using your hands to eat, make sure to ask the waitress for some limes/lemons. After you finish eating, wipe your hands with the paper towels to get rid of ALL sauces on your hands. Then you wash and rub your hands with the lime/lemon. Do it thoroughly. It should take off a good deal of the smell away from your hands. Then you just wipe your hands again to get rid of the lemony goodness and wash your hands the regular way! :D\n\nAnd now I'm craving some Hot n Juicy after writing this review!", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "We come here every time we go to Vegas.

The food was OK, but the service was just awful.   I can live with a place that is really low-brow in presentation.  No plates.  No spoons.  Paper cups. Food served in plastic bags served on a plastic table cloth.  No utensils were offered at all.  I had a few pounds of HotNJuicy crayfish that tasted pretty good, but were swimming in enough garlic to choke a small country.  Not that there's anything wrong with garlic.   Back to the utensils.  OK I get it.  Crayfish is something you eat with our fingers, but I'm supposed to eat boiled potatoes with my fingers?  That's too much to ask.   I'd also like to get offered the option of some sort of condiment with the crayfish.  Some cocktail sauce or melted butter would have been really nice, but despite having at least 6 waitresses in the place they barely spoke to us at all.  They just kept walking past us over and over helping other tables.  It was seriously incompetent wait service.  The person who took our order never really came back to ask us if we needed anything at all and we had to waive down somebody to bring a check and then we waited at least 10 minutes for change.  \n\nThe highlight of the meal was the soft shell crab basket.  The fries were perfectly cooked and the crab was plentiful and tasty.  Well done and a descent deal at around $11.  The $11 per pound price on the crayfish was high considering that there was not really a ton of food in a whole bag full.   At the end of the meal I started noticing everyone else had a bowl of lemons and what looked like a finger bowl.  We never got and because nobody was paying any attention to us at all it was a problem,  This is really messy stuff to eat.  Your fingers get caked up with garlic and spices and paper towels simply do not handle it.  When we asked for something to wash out hands we were instructed to go to the restroom - which was actually quite nasty inside.  Dark.  Dirty.  Pretty gross actually.  All I needed was a descent wet wipe like the kind most restaurants that serve messy food offer you.  Better than that would have been a finger bowl of lemon water.

Even if you come in wearing jeans, they still treat you like royalty. The waiters are not stuffy and arrogant despite the formal dining decor. And there are still a few ways to maximize your dollars. Most importantly, it was the best meal I have ever had in Vegas. \n\nWhen my sister and I went for dinner, we were both wearing black dresses. Immediately, the waiter took away the standard white lap napkins, and placed black ones on our laps--so we wouldn't get any white lint on our dresses. *WOAH* We were then asked if we had any shows we were trying to get to, and they said they would do their best to get us in and out to catch our show. *SWOON* There really is a server for each person, and they also synchronized the placing of the food in front of you. We had an awesome French server, David, who was very nice, informative, and funny. He cracked great jokes and made great food suggestions. Our other wine/beverage server was also REALLY HOT!\n\nNOW...the important part. The food. Selecting off the menu was probably the hardest thing I did in Vegas--it all sounded good. My sister and I decided to share everything, and we selected the perfect amount of food to share between two lovely ladies. We started with the Gumbo Soup and the Turtle Soup, both were excellent. The Gumbo was perfection and the Turtle soup was really rich and sophisticated tasting. I thought it was gamey but then it wasn't--it was just super complex tasting. We then shared the Commander's Salad, which the kitchen split onto two plates for us even though we did not ask. The salad was perfect with the Pinot Grigio that I got--I forgot the name though. The we shared the crab cakes, which came out on two separate plates. Thank goodness we shared and had one each because-I've never seen cakes like these. Each cake was a two inch hockey puck of solid crab. No bread, no filling, no frying. It was ALL crab. They also topped it with some greenery on top which was quite a nice addition to the cakes. And quite unexpectedly, the crab pinchers which was suppose to be garnish still had meat in them. *YUM!* Finally, we had the Bread Puddng Souffle for dessert. It was so good--so good I still have dreams about it. It came out of the oven beautifully golden and fluffy, and I started drooling. Then the waiter pierced the fluffy baked meringue top and the entire thing slowly collapsed onto itself. He then drizzled a whiskey cream sauce onto the dessert. It was good so good. I think I would have liked to have a coffee with it, but we just didn't have time. The whole meal was perfect. It also included fabulous house bread + garlic butter which was great--we ate about 1.45 loaves (wooohoo bread refills). Because my sister and I stayed at the Aladdin (soon to be Planet Hollywood Hotels), we also had a free glass of wine each; I had a white and she had a red. The total was $87.00 (including tax but not tip). I will DEFINITELY go back. It was so worth it. If you're going big in Vegas--you might as well go big here where you can't lose. \n\nMy tips: If you stay at the Aladdin Hotel, the meal at the Commander's Palace comes with a free glass of wine each. Aladdin may also have promotions, like when we went, that gave hotel stayers a coupon that offers $25.00 off at any Desert Passage store or restaurant (Commander's Palace included). Desert Passage is the shopping area inside Aladdin where the Commander's Palace is located; it is a nice pace without too many crowds. Also, if you go to the Desert Passage customer service desk, you can get a book of coupons for the shops which includes one for the Commander's Palace. The coupon is for one free Bananas Foster dessert with the purchase of two entrees at the Commanders Palace. I hear this dessert is almost as sought after as the Bread Pudding. Don't forget to make reservations ahead of time! Try to eat earlier when the restaurant first opens to avoid  crowds. Either way though, you'll still get great service.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 3, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Commander's Palace in Las Vegas is offering several lunch deal which is worth checking out. There's the 25 cents martini, a 3 course pri-fix lunch for $18.80 and another 3 course pri-fix called creole lunch.\n\nI ordered the creole lunch, which comes with turtle soup, pecan crusted cat fish and bread pudding souffle. \n\nThe turtle soup is quite complex, and right before serving, a little sherry is drizzle on the soup to further heighten the taste.  Quite good, but not dazzling.\n\nThe catfish is nicely fried, topped with a bitter green salad. The fish is cooked perfectly with a almost crispy crust and fork tender flesh. However, being catfish, one cannot escape the muddy taste.\n\nThe breadpudding souffle is breadpudding in a cup topped with a airy souffle on top. The souffle part of the dish is very light and very good. I am not a big fan of bread pudding, and this is definitely a little too sweet and too heavy for me.\n\nOverall food is good, but did not dazzle me enough to live up to Commander's Palace's reputation.\n\nThe 25cents martini is the best deal on the strip!\n\nService is very professional.

The large portion was seriously somewhere between two and three inches thick, and the portion and it's demi-glace filled HALF of the plate, shoving the colorful mixed veggies to one side, and the side order of chicken and sausage jambalaya -- luckily in it's own little cup -- was moved onto the table to accommodate meat-slab-slicing-room. \nThe beef was cooked perfectly to order (MR for me, R for pop), tender, flavorful with or without the sauce, and just the right amount of fattiness. \nLet us return to that jambalaya.

The seasoning comes in three (possibly four) options: Kiddie Cajun (Lightly seasoned), Cravin's Cajun (the restaurant's signature blend), Lemon Pepper (A Cravin's favorite), and maybe Ravin' Cajun! (their combination of all of their flavors). Then you can further specify the heat levels: Mild, Medium, Hot, Crazy Cravin' Hot.\n\nI tried the shrimp with the Cravin' Cajun (medium) and it was served up in the familiar plastic bag over white butcher paper covered table.  And I really enjoyed the flavor of the Cravin' Cajun blend.  I also normally wear a pair of disposable plastic glove when eating this kind of food, but opted to go all natural today, and the shrimps were still piping hot. Wearing disposable gloves may help prevent your sensitive fingertips from getting burned, plus your hands will not required the through soap and hot water treatment afterward.\n\nNot into seafood served in a bag?  They also have Cravin' Cajun Baskets of Fried Chicken Strips, Fried Catfish, Fried Oyster, and Fried Shrimp served Fries.  Cravin' a Po-Boy?  They have Catfish, Crawfish Tail, Oyster, Shrimp and Cajun Sausage Po-Boys to satisfy your tummy. Still not interested???  How about their signature Etouffe, Jambalaya, Gumbo, Seafood Salad, Corn n' Crab Chowder or Lobster Bisque? They serve just about everything you could think of to order here, EXCEPT Fried Okras (Sorry Misti).\n\nAnyway, I plan to come back for dinner and try other stuff on their menu when I am more hungry.\n\nAnd in case you do not know where this soon to be popular Cajun crawfish/shrimp/crab/clams boil dining destination is located at, it is in the same strip mall as a few other local Yelp favorites (China Mama, HK Star) on S. Jone Blvd, between Spring Mountain and Desert Inn Rd.\n\nService was good.  The waitress (Myrene)  was attentative, without breating down your neck.

Somehow not as tasty, tangy and addicting, but still very enjoyable.\n- Lemon Pepper shrimp with Corn - Also comparable to Hot N' Juicy but lacked some sort of addictive ingredient.  Is it MSG?  Heh.\n- Deep Fried Catfish Basket - Now, this is where it's at!  I prefer the catfish preparation here because they thin slice the fish so that there is optimal crunchy breading per fish ratio.  The tartar sauce served along side is perfect!  Extra tart and creamy.\n- Deep Fried Oyster Basket - Little nuggets of juicy deep fried oysters.  Yum.\n- Cajun Fries - These are tasty and crunchy.  Equivalent tastiness when compared to Hot N' Juicy, but the downside, they get soggy after sitting in their own steamy heat.  I've got an easy solution for that:  Just eat it all quickly!  Problem solved for soggy fries.\n\nBonus! -  Extra seasoning shakers available to \"BAM\" the heck out of anything.  \nBonus 2! - A thoughtful addition of sinks just outside the restrooms, gives patrons the convenience of being able to quickly run over and wash their hands.\nBonus 3! - (for my man) - Big variety of all kinds of beer\n\nConclusion:  They just opened about a week ago, and I think there is A LOT of potential in the place.

The shrimp here was large and firm, I loved it!  Next time I'll just go with the medium so I could enjoy it more.  The sauce was also not as garlicky as HNJ, which could be neither good or bad- other reviewers have said \"not enough flavor\" but  could it be not as flavorful because there's not a ton of garlic in it?  hmmm...could be...BUT I enjoyed it.

That's okay, but damn get my order right at least. Two bags came to me that wasn't mine. What a tease!!! And I don't like to be teased.. especially when I'm hungry! The third was what I ordered, But had a corn on the cob added to it. I told the server this isn't mine, since I only ordered the shrimp... she told me that's what I ordered with the lemon pepper mild sauce and walked away!!! WOW okay yeah... So I'm holding this bag of hot shrimp asking everybody at the table if they ordered a corn on the cob with shrimp and nobody did. So instead of the server that completely ignoring me at the counter... I had to flag one guy server that noticed me waving at him. I told him the situation and he said to just keep the corn and he won't charge me for it. Well that's great.. if I like corn, but I don't care for it. So I gave it away to a yelper that actually was going to eat it. \n\nThe shrimp was good. Nice, plump size... great portion and the sauce had enough heat to give it that spice to make it a delicious treat. They had latex gloves and plastic gloves for your perusal.. I picked the plastic, I think the latex gloves are better, since my fingers were still stained even though I had the plastic gloves on. There were right amounts of spice and garlic. I had a piece of garlic bread from my brother that was eating with his girlfriend across the way... I would say the dipping of that bread with the Lemon Pepper sauce was crazy delicious. I could eat loaves with that combination! \n\nCrab cake was bland, mushy, no flavor for the life of it, and seriously was missing something... I felt like I was eating shredded, soggy mush. For $11 this was a major disappointment, since I'm a HUGE fan of crab cakes. I even asked the server if this was really good. She replied oh yes it's so good. I despise liars... This was not good at all. I highly recommend Not to order this appetizer. The only thing good about this dish was the Sauce! Without it, it would have been a complete disaster and I would have asked to send it back to order something else. I asked the server how is it cooked... she believes its fried, happy to hear.. in that case the outer patty would have at least had some crisp to it or Something! Not one crisp area. You know when a toasted bread gets soaked in water.. that's the texture. The taste was off, no freshness, very plain jane, uninteresting, I could go on, but...\n\nThe server thought I ordered sweet potato fries and questioned me if I was sure that's what I ordered, since that's what she had in her hands to give me... I had to tell her a few times... No I know what I ordered and it was sweet potato tots. Ever since I had some from a food truck last week.. I've been having this new love for tots made from sweet potatoes. I'm thinking why question me what I ordered when I just told you what I ordered?!?? Kiddin me?! And there is a big difference between fries and tots, so if that server was thinking I would still take it even though that wasn't what I wanted, the answer would be a big fat no. I won't order something I don't want.... Period. The tots when they finally did arrive was hot and had a good amount of crunch. The flavor was on point and this was my favorite from everything I ordered.

I thought I was missing something and noticed I was charged for a side of sausage that I didn't even get. When I told that server that I never received it, she questioned me AGAIN!

The waitress offered to have the kitchen split the chowder 3 ways before we even asked. Extra points for her. We had the intention of ordering all this to start with, to share, and then adding on from there but this ended up being the perfect amount of food. Everything was good. I actually have no complaints about the food or the service.

The sauce here wasn't  as spicy as I was hoping for nor did it have as much flavor. I like to peel my shrimp then dip it into the \"bag sauce\" to add extra flavor, however the bottom of my bag had almost no sauce and was completely covered in chunks of garlic bits.\n\nAlso I ordered cajun fries, and one good thing they had is the seasonings they put on the cajun fries they gave you in a shaker at your table, that way you can add more. This is a good thing because when you order your cajun fries they sprinkle the seasoning on top and when you get to the middle you just have regular fries and all of the seasoning is gone.\n\nService, when it came to taking our order the girl who was supposed to wait on us, didn't know we were seated yet so that was a miscommunication, and when our food came people only stopped by for refills not to check how the food was, or ask us how we were doing They just grabbed our water cups and filled it up then left.

One of our friends said it was too salty and they prefer Hot N Juicy.  I did not agree.  I thought the seasoning was accurate.  Brought back memories of crawfish boils at the park in summertime Louisiana.  Seasoning so hot you were destined to have chapped lips afterwards.  Also, lots of garlic.  I love to dip the meat in the seasoning after removing the head and shell.\n3.  Washing stations near the rest rooms.  Sinks, soap, and paper towels.  Eating boiled shrimp and crawfish is messy.  If you rub your face and get seasoning in your eyes it WILL ruin your day.\n4.  Sweet potato tater tots.  Yummy!\n5.  More seating, longer tables, and more booths\n6.  Better parking\n\nThey did not purge the crawfish or shrimp.  That is, the gastrointestinal track was still full of poop.  Yuck!  However, I ate anyway knowing that it would not hurt me.  Otherwise, this place would have been shut down long ago.  In Louisiana we soak them in salt water for a while before cooking.  This causes them to purge everything from their system.\n\nThe shrimp and crawfish were served in clear, plastic bags.  Wear your bib and leave the shells on the plastic table cloth.

We had a big table, so it took a little while to serve all of us, but once that matter was taken care of, the eating began.\n\nTheir crawfish are good.  I got a 1 pound medium level spicy bag, and the serving was excellent.  The problem with crawfish in general, however, is the fact that for all of its tastiness, it's just a little meat on that sucker.  Don't misunderstand me.  The choice was excellent and I don't regret it, but after seeing the shrimp that the others got, I know what I'm going to have to get the next time round.\n\nThey have other seafood/Cajun treats if \"crustacean in a sack\" isn't so much your thing, and their beer selection is fun.  They have a beer served in a Buddha-shaped bottle that is top-notch, and the mugs weren't just frosty cold, they were freezing cold.  That's going to be a great experience to check out when the weather warms up. \n\nPrices were respectable, service was patient and friendly with the large crowd, and the bibs kept all the food bits off the front of the shirt (which you'll find that you are going to need).  \n\nI've been wanting to try this place for a while now, and now that I have, I have a justifiable reason to return.

Of course, it wasn't open yet, so I shed a small tear and considered heading over to H&J's to satisfy this sudden crawfish craze that came over me - of course, that's when I remembered I aint a big fan of H&J's.\n\nWeeks later, I saw people scurrying about around the place and, once again, I broke several traffic laws trying to get turned around. Apparently, this time they were having a little job fair, looking for a staff I guess (don't think I didn't consider a sudden career change).\n\nThen, life got busy, they opened and I didn't even notice. It was several weeks before I happened to catch that distinguishable sign again, so of course I dropped everything I was doing just to get some of those delicious bugs that make my life happy.\n\nOkay - that's the end of my happy.\n\nNow for the review. \n\nCravin' Cajun is just another H&J - with a little bit different sauce. \n\nThe problem, as is the problem with H&J's, is that, apparently, crawfish in Vegas means 2 things. \n\n* Tiny, little, midget crawfish.\n* Impossibly overwhelming sauce.\n\nThe crawfish were almost too small to eat, I should have probably just ate them whole - it would have been better. Where do they get these things? \n\nAnd the sauce (while honestly quite delicious) so overpower the crawfish, you can't even taste those wonderful juices that come from sucking the head. People, crawfish have a delicious flavor, and it's completely lost in the sauce.\n\nSo in conclusion, Vegas still doesn't have a decent crawfish joint. \n\nCan't a guy catch a break?", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 4, "useful": 4, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "What a pleasant surprise!

Perhaps they weighed the bag with the water in it.  The shrimp in lemon pepper was way over salted.  It hung like a slurry in the bag over coating the shrimp.  The seasonings were off.  The shrimp would not peel.  Not sure why.  I think it was over-cooked.  We guessed that they combined all the stuff that they were about to throw out (it was almost closing).  The meat did not have the bounce that fresh shrimp does.  The rice was skimpy.  My fiance said it was stinky and smelled old like it was left over from yesterday.

Just give me 5 lbs. of crawfish, Cravin' Style (although lemon pepper is really good too) and throw in some corn on the cobb and andouille sausage and i'm set, bam!\n\nI shared a bag with one of my more daring co workers and since she opted for mild, I asked the waiter to get me a crazy hot version of the sauce as dipping sauce, viola.  \n\nLastly, just like getting your nails did, I must say that there is a strong correlation with Vietnamese cats and good crawfish.  I'm sorry, to me my Viet homies got me hooked on this.  It is really hit or miss on whether you will like/dislike crawfish.  It is more than getting a meal, it is an experience like no other.  If you have'nt tried it, don't knock it.\n\nThere is a method to the madness as well.  Real quickly, grab crawfish, hold facing non dominant hand perpendicular to what you are facing, pop off the head with the index (yes, suck the juicy brains out), break off arms with other hand from below (yes, more sucking involved and some peeps actually take the time to crack open the arms if they are ginormous), break the seal ring (secret), then peel several layers of the shell (the fresher the crawfish, the less you need to peel) dip and suck the meat right out! (Repeat).  Many can't stand the work for these little fresh water lobster cousins.

I went for the single crabcake on a bed of crawfish. I'd order the double cake, but I can barely finish one! It's so good though.

The light breading (probably panko) is very complimentary, and the crawfish... oh my, I could eat a pound of crawfish by itself (which is no longer on the menu, sniff sniff) but this crawfish is shelled and lightly sauteed in a buttery sauce with a hint of lemon. I will admit, it was a littel saltier than usual, this time, but not overly salted. I also had their wedge salad, but had to send first one back when it came with the carrots I had asked them to omit. The replacement salad came with croutons (which the first did not have), which I just picked off.

Now we can understand why this place was bursting at the seams.\n\nSo anyway, we get there, it's packed, however we were able to be seated in about 20 mins. Now considering the average wait was about 45mins to an hour, we were some happy campers. (Thank you Haley !!) We get seated and the poor family next us were having a little bit of a rough time considering they had been waiting for 1.5 hours to be seated and had three kids with them. Haley asked if we wouldn't mind moving to another table so that they could accommodate this family. Of course we said, considering how fast we got seated, no problemo.\n\nWe are now comfy cozy at our second table and we wait, and wait, and wait for exactly 7 mins before we are acknowledged.

So we ordered the appetizer trio which had mini shrimp, crawfish fondue, fried alligator and calamari. YUM!  We also ordered some mudbugs (crawfish for those that don't know that term) and they were off the hook. Salty yes but well worth the mess and swollen fingers and toes I had later from all that salt. We ordered our main courses as soon as the appetizer arrived so that we wouldn't have to wait so long (or so we thought) JD ordered the blackened catfish poboy, Dennis ordered the mardi gras pasta, and I ordered a dozen oysters. Now mind you, Eric warned me that it was going to take at least 15 to 20 mins for the oysters to arrive but everyone else should get theirs before me. No problem I said I can wait.  So 20+ mins later, I get my oysters but get this, they guys are still waiting for their food. Not good!! Not good at all. The General Manager, Asogi had already been to our table earlier that night to personally speak to JD as he had been there a few times before and the service had been pretty bad.  Asogi listened to us voice our concerns and let us know that he would be talking to his staff about the quality of service that not only we were receiving but all the guest  were receiving. Cool!!! So back to the food. It's been 20+ mins, I have received my oysters, which by the way was going to take the longest, waited about 5 mins to get an oyster fork, prepped them to eat them, had eaten 6 before they had received their food. Tsk, tsk, tsk. So we asked to speak to Asogi again and we let him know that the guys had just received their food even after Eric told me that my oysters would take the longest.  Asogi was like \"you are just receiving your food since I came over to talk to you earlier\"? We said yep and mind you, the restaurant had died down by then, meaning that there were quite a few empty tables. Asogi apologized on behalf of his staff and comped our entire meal! Wow. That is not what we were after. We just wanted to get our point across and let him know that although we love the food, the service kinda sucks.\n\nYes I know this is one long review but my point is this, overworked servers leads to crappy service which leads to unhappy guests. Will I go back? Absolutely! The food is very good and very reasonable. Eric our server even apologized and yes he still got a very nice tip from us.

I ordered the filet topped with crabmeat and a wonderful sauce. It was perfectly cooked according to my request, and certainly didn't need anything extra to enhance its flavor. Johnnie talked to his manager and, after his talk, I was comp'd my meal (less my two glasses of excellent wine). I told his manager that Johnnie had saved the day. The manager said the person who was working my area of the restaurant hadn't shown up for work that day. I didn't really appreciate the excuse.

Well... I think we found it in Pappadeaux.\n\nService:  5/5\n\nThe service we received at Pappadeaux was outstanding from the moment we arrived until the moment we left.  It was about 7:30 on a Friday evening when we got to the restaurant, and since we had been traveling, I did not have the opportunity to make reservations ahead of time.  The parking lot was VERY crowded and we were afraid of a long wait time.  But we were quoted 5-10 minutes when we arrived, and were seated after 7 minutes.  We got one of the few booths in the restaurant near the bar area.\n\nOur waiter, Nate, was very attentive and helpful.  He pointed out some of their more famous dishes and the specials, some of which we ended up ordering.  He was prompt in refilling our water glasses when needed and even stopped a moment to chat with us about our 4-month old son.  The only small blemish I would mention is that dessert was a long time in coming.  It took about ten minutes after we ordered it.  Now I know they don't bake cheesecakes on the fly, so I'm unsure about the reason for the delay, but I thought in the interest of being complete that I would mention it.\n\nFood:  5/5\n\nAbsolutely no complaints here.  Everything we ordered was outstanding.  My wife and I got the baked oyster trio and split a Greek salad for appetizers.  The salad was great and so were the oysters.  The salad is served table-side for that extra little touch.  If we were to order again though, I think we would have just gotten a full order of the Parmesan baked oysters instead of the trio.\n\nFor entrees, I ordered the special of the evening which was Salmon Diablo, a blackened salmon fillet with extra kick.  The only very minor complaint I would note is the sauce was a bit too much.  It was absolutely delicious, a mix of crab meat and butter and cream, but it overpowered the fish to a degree.  I ended up eating it separately.   As I said, delicious, but a bit much.  My wife ordered the lobster bisque and it was every bit as good as other reviewers have commented.\n\nFor dessert we split a carrot cake cheesecake.  I'm always on the look out for new and interesting desserts, and while I have had tons of cheesecakes, this was a combination I hadn't encountered before, so I had to give it a try.  The sweet potato pie also looked interesting, but we went with the cheesecake.  Aside from the delay mentioned above, no complaints here.  The cake was moist, flavorful, and delicious.\n\nOverall Impressions:  5/5\n\nThe environment at Pappadeaux is exactly what you would expect.  They do a good job of bringing in that Cajun/creole atmosphere and balance an upscale look with a \"down home\" attitude.  You'll feel right at home here in your t-shirt and jeans, or in your business attire after a long day at the office.

At home, I've been to just about every Pappas restaurant there is many times.  The Pappas family is an integral part of the Houston restaurant scene, love them or hate them.

And in good old H-Town, they have a longstanding informal rivalry with the Goode family, who are like the working man's Pappas family, maintaining similar but less pricey/fancy restaurants.

You've got your fried fish (yummmm) and you've got your grilled fish (yummm!!!).  Their po-boy is not too terrible at all, considering how removed it is from its original context!  As a matter of fact, it was downright tasty!

If I didn't have to drive 40-45 minutes to get there, I would probably spend my entire paycheck on two things: Oysters and Fried Alligator.

Those are really the only two things that I eat when I go, because I cannot get enough of them.\n\nFirst things first, the staff and ambiance. The music can get a little bit loud, but the atmosphere is always fun and upbeat. The staff all seems to be pretty friendly, too. Our server was especially friendly and helpful. This is definitely a place I like to go to with my friends to hang out and have a good night.\n\nNow, I'll talk about the food. First, the oysters. The oysters here are great! They give you a few different sauces to go along with them, each of which has a distinct, delicious flavor to add. To make the oysters even better, they have incredible deals on them! They only cost about $4.00 per dozen for the special they supposedly have running almost all the time. The type of oysters that you get on the special vary based on whatever factors affect the catching of oysters. As for the Fried Alligator, IT'S FRIED ALLIGATOR. As soon as I saw it on the menu, I had to have it. To quote one of my favorite movies (Transformers), \"Alligator is the most succulent meat.\" The Fried Alligator here is one of my favorite things to eat. I absolutely cannot have enough Fried Alligator. The meat is moist and juicy with a light and non-fishy flavor, and the batter/breading layer is fried crisp. That combo of the moist meat with the crispy outside is phenomenal. Add on the dusting of cajun seasoning and the creole dipping sauce, and you have a dish you won't forget. \n\nIn conclusion, I definitely recommend this place.

Lots of fried goodness on there, including crawfish, stuffed shrimp, regular shrimp, catfish and a blue crabcake. We both mistook the crabcake for a hush puppy because of its size and shape. I asked if I could try the \"hush puppy\" and hubby handed it over. I should have kept my mouth shut and just eaten the whole thing because he doesn't like them but I stupidly said, \"Hey, this is crab!\" The look on my husband's face was priceless, I could just tell he was begrudging me the bite I'd just taken. I was nice and handed it back to him without a fight. Sucker. \n\nThe verdict from him on the Pappadeux Platter was that it was good and tasty but next time we go he's going to try something else because that was a lot of fried food. Of course our very helpful server had told us they can basically make anything on the menu other ways than what is listed so maybe getting some of the food on there grilled or broiled would have been a option? \n\nFor me, it was the Crawfish Platter, which consists of Fried Crawfish and Crawfish Etouffee.

All I can say is, the Phoenix location bears no resemblance to the places we visited in the Lone Star State.\n\nHaving read some of the other reviews, it seems everyone has had the same experience with respect to having to wait in line endlessly for a table, even mid-week. We waited over half an hour for a table on a Wednesday evening. The bar was too packed to find a seat and no matter where we stood as we waited we seemed to be in someone's way. \n\nAnd yes, this place is EXTREMELY noisy. We couldn't hear ourselves think. When we were finally seated in a drafty spot in the middle of the room, I ended up putting earplugs in (I travel by air a lot, so always have a pair handy in my handbag). Even then, the noise gave me a headache. We found ourselves shouting across the table to each other to be heard and even the server had difficulty hearing us when she came to take our order; she had to stoop over and practically put her ear to our mouths.\n\nWe ordered some appetizers -- a small salad and a cup of soup -- which took over half an hour to arrive. The waitress apologized profusely and seemed flustered and run off her feet; I felt kind of bad for her. With the noise and high traffic, it can't be a fun place to work. \n\nThe entrees came out not long after and my Seafood Mixed Grill, which I'd enjoyed immensely in both other locations, arrived at the table sizzling and white with grease. The side of soggy steamed broccoli, which I'd specifically ordered plain, was greasy to the touch and there was a huge pool of butter on the mashed potatoes -- and an extra cup of butter on the side! When I voiced my discontent the waitress assured us that the grilled fish had simply been \"lightly brushed in oil\" and that there was nothing on the broccoli (it was glistening; I ran my finger across it several times and I could have used it as hand lotion it was so heavily coated).\n\nShe offered to take it back and make something different and the manager came to the table and said she understood we weren't happy -- a good business move, which I appreciate -- but having invested so many hours in the experience already, and having a headache from the noise, we just wanted to get out of there. \n\nThey boxed the uneaten food, which I put in the frig when I got home for my husband to eat. I took it out the next day and about a quarter cup of oil had slid off the fish and congealed at the bottom of the styrofoam container (I'm not exaggerating).

It's not someplace I go regularly, rather reserved for special occasions. It's a little on the pricey side but certainly in line with the usual value they offer. The food, service and ambiance have always been top-notch and I've been saying for weeks now that it's where I wanted to go for my birthday dinner.\n \nDespite the fact that they're a chain (huge in Texas and elsewhere, but only 1 single location in Phoenix), I feel like they operate like an indie and get it right on most fronts.  My favorite dish is the Crawfish Platter (a ginormous platter piled high with authentic dirty rice in the middle, flanked by breaded, fried crawfish on one side and thick, savory crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e on the other side).\n\nLast night's birthday dinner was unfortunately an absolute bust.  I was excited to show my boyfriend the amazing wonder of Pappadeaux's, as he'd never been there before and I'd been talking it up for weeks.  We were seated right away (which was atypical because they're always packed), but we did get an annoying end table right on the corner so there were constantly people pushing past us and bumping into my chair.  Whatever, luck of the draw, and I was happy to be seated right away.\n\nOur server Erich came over and took our drink order.  I ordered a Coke and water.  I got Diet Coke, which tastes like poison.  Waited a few minutes trying to flag him down (admittedly this guy had at least 2 other tables he was waiting on) and I pointed that out to him and he launched into some weird back and forth about how it should be Coke.  You're tellin' me buddy, that's WHAT I ordered.  He took it away and a different server brought me a regular Coke with a smile.  Very nice.  Thank you.  Then Erich returned and babbled awkwardly about the mishap. It's fine. This happens a lot. Most people drink Diet Poison - I get it.   He took our orders and said he'd be back with some bread.\n\nThe bread and butter was dropped off pretty quickly, which is when we realized we had no set-ups.  It's kinda hard to spread butter on your bread without a knife.   We waited a few more minutes looking for him to flag him down again.  He grabbed set-ups for us and said something about \"I wish we could assure that all tables could have set-ups when they're bussed but that's nearly impossible...\"  Ok, whatever, I just want utensils and a napkin.  Thank you.\n\nThe food this time was OK.  Normally it's stellar. Maybe I was already annoyed by what I considered \"Strike 1\" and \"Strike 2\".  Both crawfish entr\u00e9es were great.  The dirty rice was definitely subpar --undercooked and very dried out/chewy.   Erich asked us if we needed anything. I asked for an extra tartar sauce and a spoon for my \u00e9touff\u00e9e.  He brought them right over.  At that point, at the beginning of the meal my Coke was still full. Like most people, I drank it intermittently while I chewed and ate and it was soon gone, but I still had half a plate of food to eat.  No sign of Erich.  No Coke in my glass. So I just continued eating and finished my plate.\n  \nAt the end of the meal, Erich re-appeared and asked if we needed anything.  My other half motioned at my glass but at that point my food was gone and I just wanted to leave.  Erich then realized that maybe I wanted a refill and asked if I did. I said don't worry about it and asked for the check.  Then we waited some more.  The check came and I swear to you the fastest thing I saw the waiter do all night was process the check and get us out of there.\n\nWhat bugged me was that I could see many other tables around us being served and having a great time with their servers, lots of smiles, hospitality and ambiance. I felt like we got the shaft.\n\nI have to say that in the past I've always had impeccable service, amazingly fresh food and a top-notch experience at Pappadeaux's.  Perhaps this was an off night.  Perhaps Erich had too many tables.  Perhaps we shouldn't have even left him 10% gratuity.  Three dings on service, one on food and one on the crappy table.

After watching the patio remain largely empty for at least 20 minutes, I approached the front desk and asked, 'how come we aren't being seated since the patio is not full?\" She immediately grabbed a couple of menus and seated us.  We later asked our waiter what was going on, he said ...'million dollar business with a couple of high-school kids running the front desk'.

Which again is fantastic, it has a delicate balance of sweet and sour but the glass is so loaded with ice you're literally paying $3.50 per glass on about  cups of actual juice.  The atmosphere is fun the lighting is more on the dim side but it fits the New Orleans theme throughout the restaurant. This place handles large crowds like a champ, my group this past Saturday was a party of 12 and the server had no problems with remembering who ordered what, as well as properly splitting the check. I highly recommend the restaurant to any seafood lover. If you don't like seafood there are a few other options but not many; the few they have are well executed. I also recommend trying out the Chef's Special of the Night.

We were appalled and my boyfriend asked to speak to a manager.\n\nThe manager came over and spoke with my boyfriend. Not sure what was said, but after that things got much better. The manager brought us an appetizer plate on the house. Our food ended up being really good - including the alligator. I got shrimp etoufee, and it was great. The gumbo wasn't so fabulous. Overall, everyone was satisfied with their meal. We got three different drinks, and they basically tasted the same: like cherry Nyquil.\n\nThe food was good, but it's not always about the food.

The place wasn't too busy when we arrived, about a 20 minute wait so we took seats at the bar which was open. It was nice to see that the bar offered full service and had the wait been longer we might have entertained the though of sitting at the bar but there is limited space and we weren't sure how big the servings were, the plates, etc. So we grabbed a few beers and waited. They do have Turbodog on tap which I had never heard of before then. The bartender offered me a sample and I really enjoyed it. We weren't up at the bar long and our pager went off. We had to cash out there which is customary and we headed to our seat.\n\nOur waitress was very friendly. We already had beers so she didn't need to get us drinks and we already knew what we wanted for appetizers so we ordered right away the and appetizers came out pretty quickly. We had the oysters Baton Rouge were fantastic to be honest with you. No complaints at all there. \n\nFor our main dishes I ordered the Jumbo Shrimp Brochette and Brandi ordered the Crawfish Platter which includes fried crawfish and crawfish etouffee. Each dish was 23.95 and neither dish was worth it. The jumbo shrimp was flavorless. All you could taste was the bacon. You could have served me straight bacon for 5 bucks and it would have tasted the same. The jalapeno rice that came with it was good though. the fried portion of the crawfish platter was plentiful and very good but the etouffee was bland. \n\nOn top of that we never got any bread until the meal came out and here's the kicker on that. It took an HOUR for the meal to come out. Keep in mind they weren't even really that busy. We had 3 tables sit down around us afterwards and all three got their food before us. And the thing is the waitress was oblivious. We had to track her down in order to inquire about our food. I feel it is part of her responsibility to know that we are sitting there for an hour without food. She said she would get a manager right on it. and when we did get the food it was brought by a manager to us but he never once acknowledged us or said he was sorry for the wait or anything. Didn't ask if we needed anything else either. Came, dropped our food off and split. To be honest with you I expected the food to be cold as if it was sitting somewhere forgotten about but it wasn't. Seemed fresh which makes me think the order never was put in and when it was they made it immediately. \n\nFor me to go to a place to eat and drop 100 bucks I expect better food than what I got and I definitely expect better service. \n\nI was extremely disappointed in this visit.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Every time I go to Pappadeaux  I get the item on the Appetizer menu, Large order of Fried Alligator.

The couple we sat next to are regulars of the restaurant and raved about the food before we even sat down to eat. The restaurant itself is very vibrant and nice. The decor is a little outdated but still comfortable. You can dress up or be casual.\n\nWhen we got our table, we were greeted by a friendly waitress. We were immediately served bread and continued to have great service throughout the night. If our waitress didn't get to us, there were many other staff available to get drinks, napkins, bring out food, etc. When I asked to sample the gumbo, they were more than happy to bring out a sample. It tasted great with the bread! I decided to eat light and went with the mussles whereas my boyfriend ate the mahi alexander. He loved it! Big portions but also a big price tag. \n\nFor good seafood, this place is amazing. They also have a nice outdoor patio and on a nice night, it's nice to sit out and eat. They also have a live band on the weekends too. Overall, this place is great and will definitely return!", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "We walked in and were completely impressed by the ambiance and the overall look of the entire place.  We stared with the shrimp cocktail - which had Fresh gulf shrimp, chunky avocados & pico de gallo in a spicy cocktail sauce.  I can say, this was the best shrimp cocktail I have ever had.  We also split a ceasar salad which was perfect.  For dinner, I had the Mahi blackened over dirty rice .  The fish was fresh and spicy - all their fish is flown in daily.  My date had the Pasta Mardi Gra - Linguine tossed with crawfish, andouille sausage & crimini mushrooms in a marinara cream sauce topped with jumbo grilled shrimp. . .  This dish was quite spectacular... We thought we were in New Orleans...  For desert, we had NY Cheesecake - with fresh strawberries in a sauce - topped with fresh whipped cream - I can't think of any cheese cake I have ever had that was better than this...  The desert plate they bring to the table has all the deserts on there - they all looked amazing- quite a difficult choice... WOW - the entire dinner was perfect!  AND on top of it all, our service was top notch.  SAM was excellent - he talked with us and explained the items we had questions on, cleaned the table in between courses, and gave us fresh silver ware - along with always keeping our drinks full.  And he had a great attitude - he acted like he wanted to make our dinner very special.  The manager came and talked with us also, and thanked us for coming in.  Quite impressive.

I asked him what he liked and he recommended the Mahi Alexander... Which I ordered!  My husband ordered the filet and lobster combo. Everything was cooked to perfection. The steak was so tender, the lobster was so buttery and tasty and my Mahi Mahi was paired perfectly with the dirty rice and the creamy crawfish.  YUMMMMMY!!!!\n\nOf course, we couldn't finish everything ... Oh, and the baked oysters were soooo good! We ordered the Oyster Duo for our appetizer ... We also order the banana bread pudding for dessert... Also good! Our girl waiter took our dessert order and asked if we were celebrating anything special and after telling her it was our anniversary, our dessert came with a note written in strawberry jam \"happy 18th wedding anniversary\" Couldn't finish it all either but was able to take it home in the mason jar it came in. :) \n\nWhat a great impression this place gave us!

Both soups were very very salty, but I was ok with that and ate half my soup. For the main course, he ordered the blackened catfish and I got the sea bass. My hubby took one bite of the fish and knew it was bad. I took a bite and yes it was very bad, not just bad in taste, but it tasted rank/sour. My sea bass was good, but what made me mad was that we told the waitress and she said she would have the manager come over and talk to us...... We waited and waited.... I ate my dinner alone while my hubby had nothing....... Finally the waitress came over and after two glasses of liquid courage, I gave her a piece of my mind. Evidently, that brought the manager over. My hubby didn't want to risk another choice from the menu and I was finished eating. They comped our meal, but that didn't make my birthday any better....

I had the Strawberry Tea and my mom had the Mango Lemonade, and they were both flavorful without tasting artificial. No review on the alcoholic drinks, unfortunately. The meals were VERY generously sized (Seriously, we all took home enough to have a second and possibly third meal tomorrow) and good... for the most part. The fried crabfinger dinner was a bit salty and the lobster bisque might not be for everyone. The clam chowder and pasta mardi gras were amazing though. Also, beware the dirty rice--the taste really lives up to the name, and you may not be prepared for it. My mom, thinking it was just a clever name for a rice pilaf, certainly wasn't.\n\nService was great! Our waiter was very ninja-like, suddenly reappearing with refills. He was extremely friendly and helpful with the menu. Our only issue was that at one point, as we were at the end of our meal, he seemed to disappear completely. We wanted to get our plates boxed and our check paid, and that took much longer than we expected. Still, it wasn't exactly a hassle waiting for him to show up and I'm sure we could have been more proactive about getting the bill if we had really been in a rush.\n\nIn short, a great place to dine if you don't mind spending a bit of money.

All previous Pappadeaux experiences in any location, including at the IAH terminal consistently are 5 star.  We are huge fans of the Pappas group, and were looking forward to our anniversary dinner.\n\nWe arrived about 5:45.  I gave our name to the hostess, was told to expect a 45 minute to 1 hour wait and handed a pager.  We grabbed seats at the bar, right in front of a draft beer station and I noticed a stale, yeasty smell, like the stench after a kegger at the frat house.  Watching the bartenders pour the beers, I immediately knew the cause.  They were extremely sloppy in their pours, letting each glass overflow by 2-3 oz.  My husband observed they probably waste at least 1/2 a keg each night.  He finished his drink, but I was nursing mine.  After about 45 minutes, I asked the hostess how much longer for our table.  She snapped \"I have 2 people in front of you.\"  I replied \"That doesn't tell me how long until we're seated.\"  She mumbled 'I have 10 minutes to seat you\".  Finally, their pager dinged and another hostess took us to our table.  \n\nThe waiter approached and said \"I see you brought your drink from the bar, so what do you want sir?\"  He didn't ask if I wanted water or any other beverage.  Although friendly, he lacked the Pappadeaux professionalism.  He quickly brought a loaf of bread, but it tasted off, just flat and flavorless.  We started with the Oysters Pappadeaux, 1/2 dozen oysters baked with crabmeat, spinach and hollandaise.  We've enjoyed these in the past, each of the toppings balanced.  Not so this visit.  Our waiter delivered the dish to the table next to us.  They were confused as they ordered oysters on the half shell.  Our waiter realized his mistake and brought the oysters to us.  The primary ingredient was the hollandaise, gobs of it sloppily doused over each oyster, followed by spinach, and lastly, a minute dollop of crab on each oyster.  In the past, you could see large lumps of crabmeat.  Sadly, they would prove to be the best dish of the night.\n\nOur waiter returned after about 15 minutes.  We had to tell him we were ready to order the rest of our meal.  I got the Catfish Opelousas, a favorite of mine.  I also ordered an iced tea.  My husband ordered the Costa Rican Mahi Alexander.  The tray with the empty oyster shells remained on our table until the waiter returned with our entrees.  He seemed put off that he had to clear them in order to set down the next course. \n\nMy 1st bite of the Catfish Opelousas was dry and over cooked.  My 2nd bite was lukewarm.  Trying to decide whether to send it back, I took a 3rd bite and felt a most unpleasant, almost fatty texture.  I didn't know what they were trying to serve, but I am almost certain it was not catfish.  The menu states the Opelousas is blackened catfish with oysters, shrimp and jumbo lump crabmeat in a lemon garlic butter sauce.  There was no jumbo lump crabmeat.  The sauce was a reddish cream sauce, with no lemon or garlic.  I called the waiter over.  I politely told him \"We've been coming to Pappadeaux for almost 20 years.  I've ordered this dish many times, but it tastes really off tonight.\"  He wasn't listening when I was telling him it was overcooked and fatty.  He said \"We'll take care of that\" and whisked it away.  My husband offered me a taste of his dish.  It was blatantly dry and overcooked.  He decided not to send it back.  Soon, a manager approached our table.  He apologized, but said the reason I was unhappy is because they recently changed it so it would be the same sauce as their Salmon Yvette.  That explanation not only made no sense to me, but it was just wrong.  The Salmon Yvette is described on the menu as salmon with shrimp, crawfish, spinach and mushrooms in a sherry white wine sauce.  My catfish featured oysters, but no crawfish, spinach or mushrooms, nor any hint of sherry flavor.  I asked him if they could make the catfish with the \"old\" Opelousas sauce.  He said he was new and had to check with his kitchen manager.   He returned and said that would not be possible, but they could get me anything else.  I ordered the Shrimp Brochette.  He said \"We'll get that right out to you\".  After 20 minutes, my husband and I had picked at his dish and were well ready to be done with Pappadeaux.

On to my review...\n\nWe ordered the fried alligator, Mississippi Catfish Opelousas, and what I think was the Crawfish Etouffee.  The only saving grace was the fried alligator which was very well done.  I always used to get it at a cajun place back home so I was excited to try it here.  This is the one thing that Pappadeaux cooked right.  It was perfectly fried without it being too greasy and the alligator was tender.\n\nThe Mississippi Catfish Opelousas on the other hand was awful!  Maybe it was an off day but it wasn't nearly as good as it sounded.  The catfish fillet itself was the worse part.  You know how they usually make catfish nuggets with the stomach of the fish? The not-so-good part of the fish.  Well this fillet tasted worse than that.  The whole fillet was such bad quality that we didn't finish it.  I hate wasting food but I didn't even bother taking it home. It was a really big piece too.  It still leaves a bad taste in my mouth clearly. \n\nThe etouffee was meh.  Not as horrible as the catfish dish but I've certainly had better.  And this is not even including the ones I had in TX and New Orleans.  Didn't bother taking that home either.  And I love leftovers since that means I don't have to cook!\n\nSigh - overall, I was sorely disappointed especially more so b/c of all the great reviews and how crowded it was.

We received a generous portion of salmon topped with a mustard herb sauce and seasoned thin crisp bread toasts. The salmon seemed like it was slow cooked as it just melted like butter in your mouth.

I thought this was a masterfully prepared dish and this one really wowed me as I would like to get it again some time.\n\nWe received our dinners. My husband ordered the Gulf Coast Redfish Pontchartrain and I got the Halibut with spaghetti squash. I taste the redfish and this one is perfect, it's fresh, tasty and prepared perfect. Then I taste the Halibut and it's overcooked and dry. I sort of feared sending it back since it was still edible but my husband convinced me to do so. We flagged the waiter over and he took care of it right away and sent the manager over.  The manager and the waiter were extremely kind and didn't at all make me feel guilty for sending the fish back. They also remade my husband's dinner so he could have a fresh one with me and also gave him the option of nibbling on the current one he had if he wanted to. The manager even suggested having some salad or soup while we wait he really couldn't be more hospitable.\n\nWe receive our new dinners and both were very good. My Halibut was MUCH BETTER as it was tasty and flaky and moist. The Spaghetti squash was good it was slightly sweet and buttery and the redfish was nailed perfect again, it was really delicious.

Black Canyon Highway\nPhoenix\n\nI ate at Pappadeaux exactly one year ago, and decided to give it another try. I arrived by myself at 5:15, and was seated immediately.\n\nMy first impression was how very noisy it was. All the wait staff was busy yelling at each other and most of what they were yelling was personal business and not about orders. The waiter sat down at my table and asked \"what are we going to eat?\" I was wondering if I had to feed him too. I'm not used to having the waiter sit at my table.\n\nI started with a dozen Blue point oysters on the half shell. After a 15 minute wait, the oysters arrived.\n\nAt $17.95 a dozen, they don't come cheap, but to be fair, they were without any sand or grit. On the down side, some of the oysters were just put haphazard on the plate, and lost all of their wonderful liquor in the ice. Also bad was the horseradish, which tasted old and had absolutely no heat at all. After dumping the entire amount of horseradish I was given into the oyster sauce, I still had to add a generous amount of hot sauce to bring it up to a tolerable level.\n\nFor the main course, I ordered the large order of Fried Shrimp ($22.95). The waiter assured me that these were butterflied shrimp, and they were ordered with a baked potato ($2.95 extra). I was also offered a loaf of fresh baked bread.\n\nAfter an interminable amount of time, the shrimp finally showed up, having been brought by a different waiter. Generally, butterflied shrimp are around a U-10 size - large meaty morsels that will normally fill  you up after eating perhaps a half dozen. What came to me might have been U-25 or U30 shrimp, which were improperly cut all the way through so that it looked more like a butterfly than a butterflied shrimp. It came with a tiny cup of tarter sauce. I had to ask the waiter which particular shrimp the tarter sauce was for, as it certainly was not enough for them all. I ended up ordering 5 more cups of tarter sauce. As for the potato, it was close in size to a small football, and could have used a little more baking.\n\nAfter I finished the main course, the original waiter reappeared, and promptly sat himself down at my table again. His question was \"What dessert are we going to get tonight?\". After looking at the dessert menu and the prices of the desserts, I opted not to have any.\n\nI was extremely disappointed in the restaurant, and have downgraded it since my last visit. I'll give them 3 stars, but I must say it was a challenge not to give them 2 stars this time. They have cheapened the food, the service is poor, and the noise close to unbearable.

Compared to their normal menu prices ($$$) their HH pricing is fantastic.  And if you have a hankering for oysters this is the place to go.  Last time we went we got a dozen  of delicious Gulf Coast oysters for $7.95. They have several other HH food items in the $4-$7 price range ( calamari, catfish poboys, steamed cajun shrimp served with sausage and corn on the cob) but our favorite by far is the alligator.  They typically serve it fried but on our first visit our server recommended trying it blackened. We went with her suggestion and were not disappointed. It is served with a rich, brown sauces that is is on it's own fantastic. The drink prices on their HH are decent as well.  I usually go with their specialty cocktail \"The Swampthing\" It's a deceptively strong, frozen drink that I highly suggest. Get the large, it comes in an icy goblet that will keep your drink nice and cold as you enjoy your meal. They also have a good draft beer selection if that is more your thing.

Went twice during my stay in Phoenix.  Once during dinner and also a to-go order for lunch.  During dinner, it was very dim and some would say too dim to even see what you are eating.  Very loud so you can forget about having a nice, tranquil conversation with whomever you are dining alongside.\n\nService: DINNER - service was ok.  I got really irked when I asked for recommendations from our waiter.  Their menu is massive and I had a hard time deciding what to get.  I asked for some recommendations and the waiter immediately blurted out the most expensive thing on the menu and nothing else.  Hmm so just one recommendation...do you really think that's good, or are you just fishing for a bigger bill which will lead to a bigger tip?  Water refills were on time, and the wait staff was for the most part attentive, so the recommendation thing was the only major downfall.\nLUNCH - Called in my order and said it would be ready in 10-15 min.  Walked over from my hotel (about a 10-15 min walk) and went inside.  Hostess pointed me to the to-go pick-up area.  Went over and waited for another 5 min before being attended to.  Paid for my order and waited another 5 min before receiving my food.  Waited a total of 20-25 min for my food.  Not that big of a deal, but they should know this for future reference.\n\nFood: DINNER - After receiving a short-ended recommendation, I had to look over the menu a little bit more so my table mates placed their orders first.  I ended up getting the Crawfish Etoufee.  The dish was filled with crawfish.  Everything tasted fine except the white rice.  I'm Filipino so I've had my fair share of rice in my lifetime.  This rice tasted like minute rice.  That might fly in Phoenix, but in my world I expect something a little better.  At least the rest of the dish kinda sorta made up for it.  Portions are huge!  Everyone at my table had leftovers.  I would've had leftovers too but I was pretty hungry and ended up leaving super stuffed!\nLUNCH - I ordered the \"Louisiana\" Seafood Gumbo & Shrimp Po Boy.  Now this was good!  Gumbo had a bounty of different seafood and tasted awesome.  The po boy had plenty of fried shrimp.  The bread on the po boy could have been better.  When I dipped the po boy into the gumbo MAN OH MAN was that BANGIN!!  Here's a tip for a new menu item: instead of a \"French Dip,\" how bout a 'FRENCH QUARTER' DIP = Shrimp Po Boy + (\"Louisiana\" Seafood Gumbo - white rice).  Dip the po boy in the gumbo and as Chef Emeril Lagasse would say BAM!!!\n\nOverall: 3.5 STARS this place is A-OK.  It is a bit overpriced.  If it weren't for the great lunch I had, I probably would have given it a lower rating.

I transferred the catfish to my bread plate. I noticed that all of the other diners around me had all of their food presented in a professional manner. I'm guessing that they either ran out of plates or just thought that since my entr\u00e9e was only $14 bucks that it didn't matter.

I did see another server (ALEX) at one of the corner beverage stations not really doing anything and so I approached him and asked for Tabasco. Without looking up, he told me \"You'll have to sit down and wait for your server.\" No, really, those were his exact words. Really? No problem, I went to the back of the restaurant to the main service line and asked someone else. Clearly, since I was not in his section and therefore he could not extract a tip from me by helping out, he decided to pass on a chance to display good customer service. Not excellent customer service, just good. So, ALEX, when you pull stunts like that you not only make yourself look unprofessional, but you also drag down your other servers and the restaurant you work for by reputation.

We said that we still needed a little bit of time but he was helpful in answering questions we had about the menu.\n\nWe decided on the Seafood Platter with a lobster bisque & the Crispy Alaskan Salmon. The Crispy Alaskan Salmon was pictured on the front of their menu & it looked like a hearty piece of salmon topped with plump shrimps & scallop on a bed of saut\u00e9ed spinach ... my plate didn't reflect that. The salmon was cooked great (I had asked for it well done rather than the normal medium-rare to rare) whereas the shrimp were just okay - one was overcooked and one was not. The scallop was really squishy (for a lack of a better word) & the few pieces of crabmeat that were added to the plate were tasteless & could've been left off. Honestly, I think it would've made for a really good dish if the fish was served by itself next to some rice pilaf or steamed vegetables ... I would've much rather preferred that. As far as the Seafood Platter goes, it was your typical fried fish platter, nothing to rave about, even though it cost $27.\n\nLastly, it's to be noted that the service left much to be desired. After we had ordered our meals, we were brought a basket of bread and butter ... no silverware. There were two strips of bread in this basket: one which was soft & cut into two pieces and the other one which was not cut & quite hard. We didn't receive any silverware the first time we asked & had to ask again. The waiters caused some commotion at a table nearby after someone had dropped a water cup made of glass on the floor. None of them seemed very on top or quick about getting it cleaned up.\n\nWe did round out the evening by getting the bread pudding for dessert (our servers suggestion) & this $5 dessert was probably the best thing we had all evening!

If my memory serves me right I had no complaints with the food, the service was fine, and the concept of eating shellfish out of a bag was kind of cool. One thing that I remember vividly of the time was the shower I took that night I ate the meal and how much my hair smelled like garlic and how my clothes were marinated with the smell of the restaurant. Although the food and experience was mediocre, I felt like all the work to get rid of the stench was too much.\n\nLike I said, though, that was once upon a time. The other night, I was in the mood to eat some shrimp; some really spicy shrimp. I was out in the Henderson area visiting the in-laws and I searched Yelp for Hot n' Juicy with the intention of visiting the same location I had gone long ago, knowing full well that I should to gear up for the occasion and what would be required after. To my surprise, however, a location that was much closer to where I was popped up in the GUI and I decided to try it out.\n\nWhat a great decision! This location has recently opened up I have learned. The inside of the place looks modern and contemporary, they have nice big booths for dining and quite a bit of seating. We arrived right around 8:30 to 9:00 pm and there was about a 15 minute wait, which I was expecting for a Sunday night. There was plenty of open seating at the bar where I would have sat had my wife and I not brought our little niece along to enjoy the experience. There were 3 to 4 flat-screen TV's on each wall meaning if you every wanted to eat spicy seafood while you catch a game, there wouldn't be a bad seat in the house. \n\nPart of the experience was identical to that of the other location on Spring Mountain and Decatur; the tables are wrapped in plastic for you to discard the shells of the fish, gloves are given upon request, no lids for the drinks (although, you may be able to request one), and a little plastic bib to remind you that you hardly need to be careful while you eat.\n\nAnother part of the experience, which I thoroughly enjoyed, that I couldn't recall (or perhaps didn't exist) from my previous visit to the other location; there was a nice ventilation system in this place. The air was only mildly filled with the flavorful aromas simmering from their savory sauces.\n\nOk, now the reason I really wanted to write this review: THE FOOD. I got was I was coming for; I got my shrimp. However, I don't remember the food being this good! I ordered two pounds of shrimp. In one bag we went with the Louisiana sauce \"spicy\" and in the other we got the\"Hot n' Juicy special sauce \"spicy\". Although they were both good, the house sauce was exceptionally good. I found myself dipping the Louisiana flavored shrimp in the remnants of what was once a pound of of Hot n' Juicy Special flavored shrimp. I probably looked like a rabid dog while I sucking out whatever was contained in the heads of the shrimps just to enjoy every last drop of the sauce. I was going to the empty out the bag as a drink, but by that time my wife was already giving me the look that meant I needed to take it down a notch; so I complied.\n\nI walked out of that place a happy man. I didn't smell like I spent a couple hours in a garlic-steamed sauna and I had just enjoyed some of the best tasting shrimp I had ever tasted. Needless to say, I'll be back, and most likely to this location.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 4, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "Awesome service, great food.

We had a party of 8, but the guy server refused to seat us until at least half of our party was present. Which the eighth was a four month old baby that wasn't even going to eat. It was understandable until the tables started filling up and the only table left was ours that a girl server purposely left reserved for us. Instead of the guy server out of courtesy asking us if the rest of the party was here, which they were, but were trying to find parking, (the parking isn't that great in this plaza by the way) he was pretty darn close to just seating the next party that arrived. I felt that was rude in and inconsiderate as we were patiently waiting. The least he could have done was ask if they were here or not. They could have been walking to the door and he probably would have just seated the other party if it weren't for my husband telling the girl server that our party was parking. That was frustrating.\n\nWe finally sat down and ordered. When it came to us waiting for the food, it was taking a lot longer than I had experienced at the other two Hot N Juicy's on Spring Mountain. We were probably waiting about 45 minutes to an hour. We only ordered shrimp and the rest were chicken baskets. The other two would have the food out a lot quicker.  Definitely no more than a 20 minute wait after ordering.\n\nEvery time we needed something we had to keep looking for our server as he never really came to check up on us. \n\nAt this location, I felt the service was about a 1 1/2 stars. I love the food and the location which bumped my rating to 3 stars. I love how they have a sink in the hall to avoid the clutter in the bathrooms.

It was great but a little too much spicy, covering the natural seafood flavor, and my friend's stomach didnt like it too much XD. This time, decided to order medium instead. This locations medium, felt like a mild, if not a little lower. The sauce in the bag, seemed a little watery/diluted as well. \n\nMy mistake, i had ordered 3 lb of shrimp, medium, hot n juicy special, in 1 bag. Therefore, we couldnt really reach the sauce. Had asked the waitress for a side of sauce, which she told us they charge extra for sauce, and recommended to get like a potato or something for $0.60 and comes with the same amount of sauce. The sauce that came with the potato, seemed thicker and tastier (to me anyway) so that sauce disappeared quite fast XD. \n\nOverall, good experience.

I've wanted to try Ocean Trail ever since I heard about a new sushi place opening up at Talking Stick Resort six weeks ago.  The resort opened on Tax Day, April 15th, and Ocean Trail was supposed to open a couple of days after, but its first day was actually Thursday, the 22nd.  The sushi menu was discarded and was replaced by a Creole/Cajun- style seafood.  Specialties include pan-roasts w/ a lobster-based broth finished w/ tomato cream and gumbos, roux-based stew containing andouille sausage and chicken.  You may choose to add chicken, shrimp, crawfish, crabmeat, or oyster, or a combination of whatever strikes your fancy!  (Prices start at around $15.)  The elegant, pearlized one-page menu lists a few starters, such as oysters-on-the-half-shell ($9 1/2 dozen and less than $18 for a full order) and lump crab cocktail ($14.75), and P.E.I. mussels w/ a garlic-wine broth, salads (half- and full orders) and chowders (a New England clam chowder, which I sampled and found delicious, and a corn chowder that looked amazingly creamy and decadent!), the said pan-roasts and gumbos, plus $5 (approx.) sides of red beans, red beans and rice, rice, and steamed collard greens.  Croutons aren't housemade, nor is the wonderfully-balanced caesar salad dressing, but the desserts (no set menu thus far- this week's selections are chocolate cake, berries and cream anglaise, and a key lime tart- so you'll have to check in weekly to see what the pastry chef, who used to create pastries for Casino Arizona's McKellips location, creates.  (If you've ever tried the delightful desserts served at the Eagles Buffet, then you know what she's capable of.)\n\nFor dinner, we had the crab cocktail, a small order of caesar salad, and berries and creme anglaise for dessert.  The salad was perfectly dressed w/ a nice amount of parmesan tossed in, the romaine lettuce was crisp, and the croutons crunchy and light, and there weren't a gazillion of them, either.  (I feel so cheated when a salad has too many croutons.  I say, light on the bread and give me more veggies!)  The crab cocktail was also very nice, but I'd have preferred a bit more lump crab and less of the homemade remoulade (mayonaisse-based w/ capers, celery, onion, black pepper, dijon mustard, and Old Bay seasoning, among other seasonings).  The martini glass it came in must have contained 2/3 remoulade and a 1/3 of the actual crab.  While I wouldn't agree w/ Mom that we could get this and the salad at any Red Lobster, I did see how paying $15 for this item was a bit too steep.  (I had noticed that the menu at the Blue Coyote Cafe, located on a lower level, also offered a lump crab cocktail for $12.25, but upon inquiry was told that the host imagined the one served above would be \"more flavorful.\"  I'd like to find out if there is a difference.  I'll keep you posted.)  We were also served a big \"cone\" of table bread and a side of butter.  Just a plain white bread roll, sliced and warmed, but it paired well w/ the crab cocktail and salad.  Thank goodness for the berries and cream.  It was the only item we ordered that Mom didn't shake her head at (she thought the menu was overpriced).  This ambrosial dessert consisted of strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries sitting on a well of creme anglaise (a rather shallow well, I thought), and topped w/ homemade whipped cream and a very pleasing rolled cookie.  I inquired about the other two desserts, and we really fell for the description of the chocolate cake-- a slice of four-layer cake w/ a chocolate ganache filling.  Mom isn't opposed to coming back to try the cake :)\n\nLoved the blue-tiled walls, marbled round counter, and light fixture above the bar, but have to agree w/ Mom that seeing the serving bowls, open pots and double-boilers, and metal food containers did take away from the gourmet dining experience.  Having to choose to sit at the \"back\" of the round counter, away from the casino floor, and the excited slot machine player, also lessened the enjoyment of the cool atmosphere that Ocean Trail offers.  However, chatting w/ the chefs and bartenders does add to the fun experience, if you just keep an open mind to enjoying your stay here.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 9, "cool": 8}}, {"text": "Ocean Trail is an amazing place to dine out.

I am also a seafood and cajun food fanatic. \n\nDisclaimer: It must first be said that this restaurant is essentially a nice bar at the edge of the main casino floor--it is not a sit-down, fine dining type of place. Though the design is interesting, the atmosphere is good it won't blow you away, and you should avoid sitting nearer to the casino as the occasional smoking gambler passes by and crop dusts your food with their cancer stick. Unappetizing to say the least. Try to get as far away from the casino floor as possible. \n\nOK, now that the disclaimer is done: the food is really, really good, and surprisingly affordable for the quality and quantity that you get.  The specialties are a few types of cajun dishes: gumbo, pan roast, and seafood creole, with your choice of meat (shrimp, crab, oyster, crawfish, chicken)  or a combination of all meats. I've tried each preparation style and they are delicious. Very fresh ingredients prepared right in front of your eyes. The staff will ask you how spicy you want it on a scale of 1 to 10, so you can adjust the heat to your preference.  The other dishes and soups are equally tasty.  They also offer fresh oysters on the half shell, shrimp and crab cocktails, and a shellfish platter of oysters, jumbo shrimp, clams, mussels, and a ton of lump crab meat for only $25.  The seafood cocktails come with the spicient horseradish you've ever had, which is great for those of us who enjoy burn in our sinuses. They also have a full bar with specialty cocktails like oyster-based bloody marys and oyster/vodka shooters. I wouldn't recommend the oyster shooter, though..too much of a good thing. \n\nThe service is friendly and efficient, and also quite knowledgeable about the food and its preparation.  You get the feeling that the people who work there genuinely want you to enjoy your experience, which is unfortunately rare. All of this for very reasonable prices...getting fresh shrimp, oysters, etc. anywhere in the valley is usually an expensive proposition, but here $15-$17 gets you generous portions of very good food, and $25 gets you more shellfish than two people can finish.  \n\nIf I had one complaint, it would be that the shellfish platter is not served with a white wine/butter/parsley accompaniment or even just drawn butter for the mussels. The shrimp and crab are the stars of the show, and the clams and oysters are fresh and tasty, but mussels do not have the same distinctive flavor as the other shellfish; they are a bit bland. It needs some sort of complimentary sauce.  In any event, if that's my biggest complaint after 3-4 visits, then they're doing a good job.

My mother likes a little spice but tried the 3 and said it was almost too hot.  I order a medium to medium hot in a Thai restaurant, and got a 6, and I was sweating and it was at the edge of my comfort zone.  So be forwarned... it's spicy.  My father, however, ordered a 9, and said it was spicy but not as spicy as he wants.  He orders Thai hot usually.  \n\nI shared an order of the clams, which were tasty but perhaps a bit expensive at nearly $15.  I saw numerous shrimp cocktails, which looked gigantic and tasty, but didn't see the price or try it.  If not too unreasonable, it looked like 5 gigantic prawns, so a substantial appetizer.\n\nAnyway, I'll be back.  Which is surprising, because I usually hate to step foot in a casino.

It reminds me of a scaled down version of the wonderful Oyster bars that you might find at some of the Las Vegas Casino's, with the addition of some other tasty seafood boils, and cajun concoctions.\n\nFirst off, the Oysters on the Half Shell are reasonably priced, as fresh as I have had here in the Valley, and everytime that I have ordered them, they have been consistently fresh. I'm not sure that type of Oysters they serve off the top of my head, but they are great!\n\nAs for the Clam and Corn Chowder, they are both amazing for the Valley of the Sun! The clam chowder has a great consistency, and does not have that taste of fishy, canned clams. The flavors of the other ingredients are apparent, and the clams are just a nice tender, mild piece of meat that makes a nice filler for the soup. The Oyster crackers that they garnish the chowder with are actually seasoned, and are very tasty.\n\nThe Shrimp boil is another favorite dish. They boil the shrimp in a Citrus, Lobster Stock and finish it with a Tomato Cream sauce. They serve most dishes with crusty sliced bread so you can soak up and enjoy the juices of the dishes.\n\nThe only thing that I am not a huge fan of, was the crab salad slider. I'm not going to knock the rating down, as everyone else loved them, and the presentation was great. I think that it just wasn't what I was looking to have at the time.\n\nWhen you visit, you will most likely have the pleasure of a very nice woman of asian descent cooking your food directly over the bar in front of you. She goes by the name of Tip, which looks as if it's the first three letters of her extremely long first name on her name tag. You will quickly notice that she puts a large amount of love into her food preparation. Chat with her, she is a sweetheart, and deserves compliments on her work. Tip her out on the side if you care to, as the tips are only pooled by the servers at this restaurant. \n\nThe manager, Frank deserves a couple of bucks for seating you and taking your order, but in my opinion the one who prepares the meal should get the majority of the reward for the culinary experience that they provide, but that's just my opinion. :)  Frank is an East Coast guy with a stratight face and $500 haircut, but trust me, he does have a sense of humor, give him a hard time..lol\n\nOne last thing, and I will cut this short. The specials that they served on Easter and Fathers Day, consisted of a one and a half pound lobster with claws, caesar salad, and red velvet cake for around $30.\n\nIf you decide to order the Collard Greens, make sure that Tip is working because she prepares them proper, with bits of swine for flavor, as well as a bit of vinegar. It may not sound so great to the untrained tongue, so I suggest you give them a shot and teach your tongue a lesson.\n\nCheers! :)", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 7, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "If you are looking for some good gumbo and great conversion, then this is the place for you!

Not good.  I knew it was in the casino, but I didn't realize until I saw it that it's practically on the floor with the noisy slots and smokers.  They really should put up some sort of glass partition and circulate fresher air for the patrons.  As it stands, loud, drunk, smoking people in the casino can walk right by your table (within inches) and not be in the restaurant.  Cigarette smoke is not helpful when trying to enjoy a meal.  I have to deduct a star for this.  The buffet is isolated from the casino, they should do something for this spot too.  It's really unfortunate.\n\nThe service was friendly and helpful.  A bit inattentive, perhaps, but they were always moving.  Very busy.  So it wasn't neglect.\n\nNow for the food.  We started with the corn seafood chowder.  They warn you that it has a variety of seafood in it (squid, octopus, etc).  Not just clams or shrimps.  But don't let that bother you.  No one flavor stands out, and the seafood is chopped up small enough that you aren't going to get a mouthful of any one thing.  It was really quite tasty, though perhaps just a bit salty.\n\nThen came the shrimp boil.  Basically shrimp boiled in a spicy sauce/broth.  It also was pretty good.  I don't know that I would rave about it as other reviewers have, but I had no problem with it either.\n\nLastly, the seafood creole.  I got it with the dirty rice.  The dirty rice is very good, but the amount was pretty small for the dish.  I would have doubled it if I were the chef.  The seafood dish itself was actually very similar to the shrimp boil, except there was other stuff besides just shrimp.  It also had scallops, clams, and some other things I wasn't sure about.  It was very good, but didn't really distinguish itself from the shrimp boil much.  The sauce was a bit thicker, but in terms of flavor very similar.\n\nAll in all a pretty good meal.  I think I like Pappadeaux's better, but still pretty good.  I'd give them four stars if it wasn't for the noise and smoke.  One nice feature was specifying your spice level on a 1-10 scale.

The food is JUST THAT GOOD!\n\nIf you like okra, then you'll love the gumbo, which is also packed with fresh seafood-y goodness and okra-y sliminess.  The shrimp boil is not bad, and would be good on its own, but not when compared to any of the pan roast dishes.  The broth is a little too thin for my taste.  The chowders are excellent, as is the Caesar salad.  \n\nBut the thing that ties the whole thing together is their bread, which is kind of toasty and soft and chewy all at the same time, and which is perfect for extracting every last bite of sauce and crab bits from the last remnants of your pan roast.  Great bread + great butter + great pan roast = awesome meal every time.  And at only $12 for lunch, or $20 for dinner (for double the portion), I personally think that this meal is a steal.  \n\nSit at the bar and watch the whole cooking process take place, and prepare to be amazed.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "Went for lunch after wanting to go here for months and I was impressed.

The warm, toasty bread that accompanies your meal goes perfectly with anything you order, especially the soups and pan roasts.\n\nOne of the most outstanding aspects of this place is the camaraderie amongst the guests @ the bar.

Turns out they exclude the house wine from HH pricing so each glass was actually $7. \n\nBOTTOM LINE: I will go back to Jasper's for dinner but not for happy hour.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "One of our favorite local joints... Bartender/owner is SOOOO great and the one girl in the world my lady has a girl-crush on... \n\nThat means great service... I think... \n\nAnyway, I'm originally from Utah so I am not sure what Cajun food is really supposed to be like... but I know what I like, and I like this food. Look, if you dare to serve deviled eggs as an appetizer, you KNOW your food is fresh and awesome.\n\nAt age 43, we are usually the youngins in here, but when Ms. Crush serves a 3 oz scotch, you gotta respect.\n\nGet your butt over here; it's great.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I'ld give 6 stars if possible for each and every appetizer we have had. The tomato soup, caesar salad, beignets, and crab dip are all way more delicious than they have any right to be. However, the stand out is clearly the shrimp canap\u00e9 - one of the best  appetizers I've ever had. Period. \n\nThe other side of the coin is the at-best mediocre entrees. The first night we had a gift certificate and ordered an absurd amount of food and ended up leaving both the burger and meatloaf largely untouched. On subsequent visits the appetizers were consistently amazing and the variety of entrees just didn't live up to the apps. The blackened tacos were bland and tasteless. The meatloaf was swimming in liquid. The burger bun was overly toothsome and the burger bland. \n\nLong story short - order appetizers (which there are more than enough of) and you will be happy. Also happy hour is great but the wine is overpriced otherwise. \n\nTake away = worth it for shrimp canap\u00e9 if nothing else!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "The best house wine selection and hummus and chicken ever!", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}], "state": "AZ", "stars": 3.5, "latitude": 33.6717895}]}}
