It takes a lot for me to vocalize directly to the restaurant staff that they're ruining my meal, because of how painful and uncomfortable of an experience it is for both parties. I also hate that I'll end up manipulating my way into (or having my opinion manipulated by) a comped check; yet this was such an incredibly embarrassing and infuriating waste of time that I was outraged by the $9 discount they offered for me my trouble.\n\nTheir response to a clearly-upset customer was to hand me an order ticket and have me write my complaints in the empty space on the back. So I had to return to my table and scribble down all their problems for them, while I should have been enjoying my own meal that they had failed to deliver up to this point. I promptly ran out of space on the ticket and handed it back to them, and watched them pin it up on the wall next to their take out orders. At no point was I even offered the chance to speak with a manager.\n\nWe had come here with a friend who was gluten-intolerant, on the recommendation of a local gluten-free group's listing of \"gluten-free-friendly\" restaurants in Madison (I've since e-mailed them to recommend they remove Chautara). They had apparently been mistaken, because when asked about the menu the server was practically clueless as to what it meant nor could he fetch someone that did know. After insisting that 90% of the menu contains gluten and shrugging (i.e. not offering any alternatives), my friend ultimately ended up ordering the salmon salad. That is, until the server returned about TWENTY MINUTES LATER to inform her that they could not fry up a piece of salmon without using gluten - why I can do this in my kitchen at home, but a bunch of trained chefs at a restaurant cannot do so, is beyond my comprehension. \n\nIt also blows my mind how the waiter could not be bothered to go back to the kitchen and say \"hey guys, remember how we got accolades for accommodating gluten-free customers? Can we do whatever we did then and whip up something for her that has no gluten?\"  Nope. I'm just gonna stand here like an idiot and shrug at her. The lack of flexibility was appalling. Even McDonald's will change up my burger if I ask.\n\nSo, about 45 minutes in, we receive our fucking appetizers. They're decent but I can't even notice because at this point I'm so seething mad about how long the food has taken and how I've brought my friend to a restaurant where the waiter insults her. Main course shows up maybe another half hour later, and my friend's plate (a plain salad) twenty minutes after that.\n\nThe thing is, when you have a really good meal at a really bad restaurant, your customer isn't going to remember you for the food. They're going to remember you for the abuse you put them through, and so the details of my meal are inconsequential to this review. \n\nKeep in mind that my friend's unusual diet was not the root of our problems.

Thus, the 4-star rating.\n\nEverything I've ever eaten there has been spectacularly tasty.  The momochas and samosas are divine, and the daily specials (Tarkari) are always a treat -- spiced veggies that you can choose to pair with roti (bread), rice and/or dal.  Definitely spend the extra buck to get the dal -- it is extremely delicious and you'll wish they gave you more than that teeny little cup!  My very favorite dish is the Tofu Buff, which is seasoned tofu and veggies over rice (you can choose white or brown for any dish).  Be warned -- some of the dishes are pretty spicy, and they don't ask you to choose your spice comfort level.  But I always walk out of there feeling not just sated, but *healthy* -- like I've done something really good for my body.  I practically bounce away down State Street when I leave the place.\n\nBut that brings me to my first issue with Himal Chuli -- the portion sizes vs. the price.  Over the years, I have watched the price of my beloved Tofu Buff skyrocket to $15 -- and it's really not that much food.  I'm aware that restaurants often overserve, often to the point of ridiculousness (I'm looking at you, Cheesecake Factory).  But the dishes at Himal Chuli are really quite small -- easily finished in a sitting if you're hungry -- and as a poor grad student, I really can't swing $15 for something I can't make a meal of later.  (To be fair, the equally-small daily specials are $8 or $9, depending on whether you add the dal.)\n\nMy second issue is with the service.  It certainly isn't unpleasant at all, but it has been extremely slow in the past, even when the place was basically empty.  I also wish they took credit cards.\n\nFor a lesser restaurant, these issues would mean a 2- or 3-star review, but Himal Chuli has such great food and is such a cool place that I have to go with 4.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "We ordered the chili chicken and the green jackfruit kebab dish: Katahar Kebab.

I tried to research my review for The Gurkha, a restaurant in Edinburgh, not to be confused with the Gurkha caf\u00e9.  And not the Gurkha Brigade, which is...really, three Nepalese restaurants with the name \"Gurkha\" in the title all in the same city?  Is that a condition for being a Nepalese restaurant?  I would be happy to just have a Nepalese restaurant in my home town.  The closest I could find was in Vancouver, and its name is...huh...Gurkha.  \n\nI shouldn't be surprised about that.\n\nBy the way, the Gurkha I'm at claims itself the first and \"original\" Nepalese restaurant in Scotland.  I can read between the lines and that's effectively a giant middle finger to the other like-named restaurants.  Oh and if you click the website link on TripAdvisor, it takes you to the WRONG Gurkha.  That must sting.  \n\nThe Gurkha is an adorable sky blue-painted restaurant slotted between an acupuncturist and a Chinese take-out place, all three occupying less sidewalk space than a McDonalds and located on Morningside road (not to be confused with Morningside place or Morningside park--oh for the love of GOD, Edinburgh; you're not that big of a city!).  Gurkha is considered large in that it occupies two storefronts, one door blocked off, yet it only takes about five seconds to cross on foot.  What I'm saying is that the businesses in Morningside are tiny; it's like an economy of Lilliputians.  \n\nThe interior was a modest collection of white-draped tables, red shod chairs, and walls painted in an ill-advised choice of yellow promoted as amber but coming off as \"corn via protein spill\".  The d\u00e9cor was simple, with few fixtures hanging from the walls.  The staff was stone-faced but welcoming, wrapped in ties and vests, very posh considering the time of day.  The effort was appreciated.  I entered at lunch and noted the massive menu and listings with a very pronounced Indian inspiration.  Biryani.  Masala.  Poppadom.  Of course, there would be some carry-over--I've mentioned in other reviews that country lines mean effectively nothing and that true cuisine can only be graded by tribes and ethnicity, and even then one must acknowledge the sharing of trends between neighbors.  I say all that to educate some and prevent my lynching from others.  \n\nWhat distinguishes Nepalese from Indian (apparently) is the reduction in spice and the increase of sweeter ingredients like ginger.  This was confirmed with the dishes I ordered.  I say dishes for lunch because the Gurkha offered a lunch special, three courses for 6.95.  The first was a trio of fried breads with huge buckets (BUCKETS) of various dips and curries, after...I'm sorry, did I lose you?  You seem to be stuck on that price.  That's right, it wasn't a numerical error.  6.95.  Pounds or dollars, despite conversion, that's really cheap.  The menu prices were a little higher on average, perhaps dauntingly so if you only wanted to stop in for a quick bite, but 6.95?  That's the price for a starter in any other restaurant and here it's for three courses!  I felt like I was robbing them.  The courses were fixed but that's the brilliance.  It's one thing to have a daily special a few dollars less but to have a three course combination meal, it becomes a given.  Who would think of ordering off the main menu with a three course option for 6.95?  And you still get to choose if you want chicken, lamb, beef, or pork.  You still get a colossal slab of naan so large you can't see the plate it's served on.  After that you still get dessert.  This is beyond a good value.  And thankfully the food was fantastic.  \n\nIt was my last day in Edinburgh and the Gurkha reminds me dramatically of one of the many things I will miss about this city.  The value and possibilities cannot be quantified in the number of words remaining in this review.  The Gurkha may be one of several Gurkha-named restaurants in Edinburgh, but it would be difficult for the others to measure up.  There are many places to eat in Morningside and if you happen to be wandering along the road and come across Gurkha, THIS Gurkha, it's worth your time.\n\nFood:  5/5\nService:  3/5\nPresentation:  3/5\nValue:  6/5\nRecommendation:  4.25/5", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}], "state": "EDH", "stars": 4.0, "latitude": 55.9308866}], "1 1BP": [{"full_address": "25/27 Cockburn Street\nOld Town\nEdinburgh EH1 1BP", "hygiene": 1, "rest_id": "AZJGud8N--ScMMCcasROcQ", "categories": ["Indian", "Himalayan/Nepalese"], "city": "Edinburgh", "review_count": 8, "name": "Gurkha Cafe & Restaurant", "longitude": -3.190389, "reviews": [{"text": "This is a true little gem.  I am perhaps the world's greatest critics of Indian / Nepalese restaurants as I know what I like and they often don't live up to my standards.  I've got my favourite restaurants that I frequent and I do often try others but 99% of the time I leave disappointed.  \n\nI'm very happy to say that when I went to The Gurkha Cafe this was the other 1%.  I was anything but disappointed!!!  \n\nThe interior of this place is really cool, it feels like you're in a little hut as it has open wooden beams all over the ceiling.  I felt as thought I'd taken a plane east by just stepping through the door.  The interior really does set the tone and makes a lovely change from other restaurants in Edinburgh.  \n\nI saw someone at the table next to me drinking a Nepalese Gurkha beer so I decided when in Rome...  It was not a bad beer and went well with the food but for \u00a34.95 for 660mls it wasn't so cheap.  Worth it for the label though.  \n\nI went for the Mo Mo Cha Nepalese chicken dumplings to start and you could choose this either steamed or fried.  I went for steamed and was SO glad that I did as they were delicious.  I was a bit apprehensive but they were very tasty.  They were crescent moon shaped and there were lots of them - I'm sure I had at least 5 and was full after the starter alone as they certainly didn't scrimp on the portion sizes!  What made this dish though was the sauce that accompanied it.  I couldn't work out what was in it and it didn't say on the menu but this was a tasty little number.  I want to say it was mustard as that's what it looked like but I hate the stuff so know it certainly wasn't that.  No matter what was in it, it was divine and just pushed this dish over the edge and into the exquisite category.  \n\nMy companion had the chicken satay to start with.  This wasn't the usual Asian chicken satay that you'd normally expect as this was with a Nepalese twist.  The size of this dish could have easily passed for a main course!  There were huge chunks of chicken under a rich, tomato / barbeque style sauce.  As I said, not like the usual peanut style satay but still good.  Not as good as my dumplings though - top tip!!!  :)\n\nAnother good thing about this place (to add to the huge list) is you can specify how mild or how hot you'd like your meal to be so the dishes really are made to your specific requirements.  \n\nFor main course I ordered the chicken korma.  When ordering in fact, I asked the waiter what he recommended by telling him what I liked.  I know a lot of people think, 'boring old korma' but this restaurant gave this dish a new lease of life.  The tastes and flavours in this dish were phenomenal.  That's what I love about Nepalese even more than Indian restaurants, they use even more herbs and spices to create the perfect flavours.  Yummy!!!  Again the portion sizes were very generous but it was so tasty that I couldn't stop eating until I'd finished it all.  \n\nMy fellow diner had the chicken garlic and chilli if I remember correctly.  It came out still cooking on a hot plate and the colours of the dish made for great presentation.  The quantity as well as quality of this dish was unbelievable, we could have easily shared this alone without starters and still left full I'm sure.  She only managed a quarter of it as it was!  As I said above, although this dish is made with chilli she asked for it to be mild and it suited her just perfectly.  \n\nWe ordered rice and a peshwari nan to go with the main courses.  The nan was lovely, lighter than most nans which was a good thing considering the amount of food and it came in a basket cut into pizza style slices.  \n\nThis place really does have it all - you can't get a more central location, the highest of quality food with flavours bursting in every mouthful, good friendly service and a different yet cool interior.  It's a winner!!!  \n\nAs if you can't tell already, I love this place.  Take whatever I've written and imagine I love it 100% more then you'll be getting a bit closer to understanding how much I enjoyed this meal and now love this restaurant.

Nonetheless it is different from the usual variety that is available in Edinburgh. I would recommend the paneer makhni and the prawn malabari!
