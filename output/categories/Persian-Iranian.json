His current location is much nicer, but the food is still center stage. One critique that I've heard over the years is that people were expecting something different due to the name. PGC is not a Persian restaurant. It is however a place for great Vegetarian and healthy options that taste unbelievably decadent; flavored with spices and herbs that are typically associated with Persian cuisine.\n\nThe menu is quite large, with slight variances between lunch and dinner (dinner has more seafood and meat options - but honestly they let me order anything at anytime). There are always daily specials which are generally based on whatever Mahmoud finds at the daily market and items are clearly marked as Vegetarian, Vegan, or Carnivorous.\n\nMy biggest challenge at PGC is narrowing down the choices to a reasonable amount of food (which isn't easy because the portions can be quite large).\n\nSome things that shine as stars on the menu:\n* the hummus - served with fresh veggies and house made nan\n* barley soup (when it is one of the daily soups) - this stuff is loaded with vegetables and barley\n* angel hair feta or spicy chicken garden salad - both are HUGE and crammed full of the most amazing organic vegetables found in phx, then lightly tossed in the house dressing that is crisp and brings out the flavors of every ingredient\n*purple shoots - asparagus and eggplant, topped with saut\u00e9ed onions, garlic, scallion, tomatoes, fresh herbs, lemon juice and feta cheese\n*herb stew with chicken - I don't even know how to describe this one, but it truly rocks!\n\nMost of the meals are served with brown and white basmati rice topped with a toasted almond-raisin-saffron mix, a homemade cugurt sauce and fresh nan. I could probably make a meal on this stuff alone.\n\nPGC has a small selection of wines, but their flavored teas are so out of this world that I could float away on them. The peach tea is like none other that I have ever tried!\n\nThe only thing that I'm not a big fan of are the deserts - with the exception of the ginger and rose petal ice cream. If I'm going to splurge calories on desert, it's not going to be on a Vegan Cheesecake. But that ice cream... my mom and I split one and the first bite I took was weird and wonderful all at the same time - by the time we got to the bottom of the bowl we were having a spoon fight that required black-belt finger moves.\n\nThis is an unexpected little place that is relaxed and unpretentious while simultaneously offering table cloths and candles.
