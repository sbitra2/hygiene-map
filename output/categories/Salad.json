It isn't that hard to put soup in bowls and get it to a table. But the 2nd and 3rd time were not that great.

The 2nd time I went to this location I ordered a simple pick 2 lunch with soup and a grilled cheese sandwich. Seems really simple right...NO! I know they have a simple grilled cheese and a big kid grilled cheese with BACON but there is no way he could have \"mistakenly\" heard big kid grilled cheese while I was ordering. So needless to say when I bit into a piece of bacon I was beyond upset. I did keep my composer and had a talk with the manager who then rushed me out a new sandwich and gave me a full refund [that I did not ask for or demand in any way].\n\nMy 3rd visit was a To Go order and was two salads with some modifications, nothing major at least in my mind. I ordered the amazing Fuji Apple Salad and the Thai Chicken Salad both with modifications that are based on taste preference. Because I was about to work a double I planned to have 1 salad for my lunch right before my shift and the other for my meal later on in my shift but thank goodness I work in a restaurant or I would have gone hungry that day. To make a long story short every modification I asked for was passed over and disregarded.

I ordered a Thai Chicken Salad and a Chipotle Sandwich [that has BACON to which I specifically stated that I am a semi-vegetarian and did not want the bacon]. Before I leave I open the salad box to make sure the modifications on that are good and this time they were. I then open the sandwich box and the sandwich looks like it should look. I get home and once again bite into BACON -__- like I couldn't even understand how that could happen. But I did call and yelled at the manager at this point I was beyond done with this place she did give me a refund on the sandwich after I was done yelling.

A BLT is not exactly a culinary work of art. It is beacon, lettuce, and tomatoes with mayonnaise on bread. Yet, some restaurants mess it up. When I set eyes on my Panera Bread BLT, or more like LT; I was asking the exact question that the old lady asked in the 80s Wendy's commercial \"Where's the beef?\" In this case the beef was beacon. What I saw was a few pieces of ordinary beacon with lettuce and tomato on bread.  The bread was comparable to Wonder bread which is ironic considering that this is Panera Bread. I was unimpressed that there was not a choice of bread and that it was untoasted. The potato chips that I picked as the side was actually better than the sandwich.  \n\n  This is my second time at this Panera Bread. A few weeks ago, I dined here with Shirley. B. The roasted turkey & avocados BLT that I ordered then was a tasty sandwich. And I know that Shirley liked her soup. But that doesn't make up for the atrocity of a sandwich that I had tonight and for the record, a good amount of it was leftover bread.\n\n  The restaurant itself, which is in the Paseo Verde Parkway side of The District, is a clean and attractive dining environment. The noise level is average with some rock playing in the background. And there is sufficient seating and lighting.\n\n Panera Bread is on the dining level between fast-food and casual dining. You step in line then order off the menu board. After paying, you bring a number to a table. They bring you the food, but you serve your beverage. When your done they bus the table.\n\n  A BLT gives me an impression of a restaurant.

This location is the absolute WORST! I went for (most likely) the last time last night. I went in for a takeout salad. The employees were not friendly and looked a bit \"out of it.\" \n\nThe girl who took my order never smiled and seemed to be \"chained\" to the cash register. While she was attempting to take the order of the woman in front of me, a kid came up and asked for a takeout box. Instead of finishing the order, she stops the customer mid-order and walks away to get a takeout box. \n\nWhen it's finally my turn to order, I ask for a little extra salad dressing on my chopped chicken cobb with avocado salad. She tried to charge me almost $1 EXTRA for dressing. What? I've never had a Panera attempt this extra upcharge before. I mean, I asked for no eggs on my salad so you'd think they could toss in a spoonful of extra dressing for free. \n\nAs I waited for my order, I kept hearing the kitchen yelling about being out of this and out of that (bread, sauces, etc). Luckily they weren't out of any ingredients in my salad. I grabbed my takeout bag and headed for home. \n\nOnce I started to eat my $10 overpriced takeout salad, I was so disappointed. First, the portion size was super tiny. There was a good amount of chicken but hardly any blue cheese, lettuce or avocado (I'd say the kitchen was attempting to hide the fact that a miniscule amount of avocado was on my salad -- it was about 2 small slices that were chopped into 5 pieces each to make it look like there was more). I eat this salad at least once a week (no joke) and most Panera locations add at least 4 or 5 FULL slices of avocado. \n\nAnd as if to sum up this experience, the whole grain baguette portion in the bag was totally burned on the bottom (see photo). \n\nPanera is a good chain restaurant but this location is horrible.

Thank goodness they had the baked potato bar. Pretty hard to mess that up. Pizzas (which I find to usually be terrible at these places) wasn't bad. Kind of a meager selection at the pasta bar. I always dig the frozen yogurt bar. Butterscotch ftw.\n\nWalking in & out though, the sight of St. Francis and the proximity to Postino were killing me.\n\nWhile I will never go to one of these places on my own volition, I can handle Sweet Tomatoes and am confident that I'll be able to rustle up something acceptable.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 4, "cool": 4}}, {"text": "I don't even know why I am addicted to this place but I am.

My wife and I were first introduced to it while living in San Antonio, TX. When we moved away, we both admitted that, aside from a few friends, Which Wich was the only thing about San Antonio that we would miss.\n\nThe neat thing about this restaurant is that you build your sandwiches before you even get to the register. So, ultimately, the attendant at the register is just there to take your money. That also pretty much eliminates the possibility of your order being wrong, as you've specifically annotated every detail of your sandwich on the little brown bag beforehand!\n\nMy wife and I always opt for a chicken-based sandwich. Our toppings are similar, in that we both get the standard lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, etc. Where we differ is in our love of spice. My wife likes the banana peppers. I like the jalapenos. For some reason, my wife doesn't enjoy a runny nose while she eats her sandwich...what a weirdo!\n\nMy daughter, on the other hand, LOVES the PB&J!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VuCZEIRXIh82TuKezSZKoA?select=ZQcOT7XhU0d2-pWYbu-wWA#NRt3OfYPakxYJgyOUI_glA They give you the option to have the crusts cut off. It's a fantastic way to let your child cover their faces with a peanut butter grin. Well, I know I get a kick out of that...whatever.\n\nNow, don't be deceived upon entering this place. Since the paper bags are right near the entrance, it appears that you might be in for an extended wait for your meal...especially if you come right during the lunch rush. However, the sandwich makers at this establishment are VERY efficient (rivaling Jimmy John's) with making their sandwiches. So, even though it LOOKS like it will take a while, the wait ends up being FAR shorter than you might expect.\n\nOne interesting factoid: you can order Which Wich online http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VuCZEIRXIh82TuKezSZKoA?select=ZQcOT7XhU0d2-pWYbu-wWA#r_QZYHunPwfDIhgIolwA2w.

Haven't you ever thought of combining your liquid carbohydrates with your protein?  If you're not into beer, they have wine, or soda.  They even carry the healthier beverage of water or seltzer.\n\nWhat makes SaladWorks unique, is their focus on fresh.  They cut up each of their sixty or so salad items each morning, and throughout the day.  According to their corporate marketing speak: \n\n\"In 1986, John Scardapane developed the Saladworks concept while working as a gourmet chef at a southern New Jersey country club.  Saladworks continually won over new fans with its fresh take on salads.  John's vision meant an end to the days of chemical-coated tomatoes and brown-tinged lettuce.  He decided that salads should be made to order, chopped on-location and assembled right in front of your eyes.\"  Yeah, for some reason I'm not a big fan of salad bars because of the \"chemical-coated tomatoes and brown-tinged lettuce.\"  Problem solved.\n\nOur meal ran us $18.28, including tax which seems a little high considering we were drinking water.  I opted for the \"make your own salad\" which has the drawback of $0.79 (protein is $0.99) for each item.  So in the future, I'll start with one of their base salads and add on from there.  \n\nInterestingly, they do not have any vegetarian or vegan base offerings on the menu. D'oh!  All seem to come with a meat or fish protein attached to the salad, including the wraps.  They'll need to fix this going forward, or better educate the staff on the options.\n\nThe setup is pretty straight forward. The restaurant itself is brightly lit, very clean, and located in the old Starbucks/ Sushi restaurant location.

I actually loved it so much, I went back the next day to try something else, and everything I tasted was fantastic!  The first day, I had the Yucatan Chicken Tortilla soup (with sour cream, cheddar cheese, guacomole, and tortilla strips on top!) and the California Turkey sandwich (turkey, avocado, tomatoes, sprouts, cucumbers, mixed greens, muenster cheese, and ranch dressing).  Both were absolutely amazing, and I also got a chocolate dipped strawberry on the side, which comes with any soup or salad.  For dessert, I tried the cheesecake, and managed to eat half before feeling like I was going to explode.  it was divine.  The next day, I went back for more and tried the Chicken Enchilada Chili (made with red and green enchilada sauce) and the Turkey Bacon Avocado grilled panini (with muenster cheese and honey mustard).  For dessert, I sampled the Mixed Berry Creme Brule.  Day 2 was also awesome.  In addition to everything I already listed, I sampled other soups, sandwiches and salads that all tasted equally as delicious.  For example, the Wild Mushroom Bisque is next on my list to eat, since the sample I had left my mouth watering.  The Lobster Bisque, Shrimp & Sausage Gumbo, and Thai Lobster Curry also tasted superb.  As for sandwiches, I'd like to try the BBQ Pulled Pork next....or the Turkey Spinach Artichoke grilled panini.....or the Ultimate Grilled Cheese.  So many choices!!  I also heard amazing comments on the Nuts About Berries salad, the BBQ Chicken salad, and the Pina Colada Chicken salad.\n\nBasically, this is now my new favorite lunch place, and I can't wait to try everything they have to offer!

I believe they opened recently, judging from the overstaffing we experienced.  We were greeted just as we joined the short line by a young woman that was very excited to describe the menu items to us, and explain the process of ordering.\n\nThis place is like a combination of Paradise Bakery and Wildflower - lots of soups and salads and a few sandwiches tossed in.  You order by advancing down a counter, where you first choose a sandwich, salad or combination of dishes.  I ordered an Asian Pulled-Pork BBQ sandwich here, and the woman behind the counter turned her head and shouted \"Pulled Pork!\", it was kinda weird, but ok.  I passed on the salad as I was interested in a soup/sandwich combo, so I moved on down to the soup station.  They've got about ten different soups on any one day, and today I chose a Chicken Enchilada Chile soup.  A creamy soup that was topped with shredded cheese, sour cream and tortilla strips.  They've got all sorts of add-ins for your soups.  My daughter ordered a tomato bisque and the wife had a Wisconsin Cauliflower soup.  You then move on past to the dessert section.  I passed.  It got a little weird here, as you had to relate your order to yet another person, who repeats it to the cashier - then you pay.\n\nThey have a drink bar for beverages, mostly just a soda fountain - but they also offer Crystal Light and an assortment of flavor add-ins to make your soda \"italian\"  So here's the breakdown on the meal.  My soup was tasty, but lacking any chicken.  The sandwich was delicious, with a crispy slaw on top and slathered with a chipotle mayo sauce.  I asked for extra mayo just to taste it, and it was nicely spiced with the chiles and brought a bit of zing to the sandwich.  The wife and daughter weren't too thrilled with their soup choices, but they loved the chunk of French bread that came with it.\n\nThe negatives for me was the house-baked Ciabatta bread for the sandwich.  Too soft.  It should have a crispy crust and a bit of chew to it.  The bread that came with the soup was tasty, but cold - it should be served warm, and again, French bread should have a crispy crust.  There was no fresh iced tea.  In a place that prides itself on fresh and house-made and they serve tea from a soda fountain (gakkkk!)  Finally, the blue neon lighting.  It's great for trim and highlighting - but it should never come near food.  The icebox that contained the lemon and lime wedges for the drinks was lit with blue neon, and it makes the fruit look like it's all brown and not appealing at all.\n\nThis is a great, healthy lunch option and a place that I will definitely come back to.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 2, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "I really enjoy dining here.

Also they have great deserts here, all fresh baked. Cookies and brownies freshly made, along with smoothies and shakes as well.  These are some serious people here folks!\n\nThe menu here is ample, with plenty to choose from, but it's not as big as I remember it from the Chicago and Detroit locations.

Instead I think of it as Panera Sandwich Company.  Nothing exciting about the bread.  We used to eat here quite a bit.  The sandwich quality has gone downhill.  The value for the dollar we think is a bit out of proportion.  We don't like the \"wait your own table\" set up.  We have never had a good cup of coffee here.  The bakery has always been just so-so.   Recently they were somewhat disorganized and weren't able to fill some of our order at the time. \nTheir patio is nice with a nice view but rather small.  They need to really improve their food all the way around.   \nWe can pay the same price at the Great Dane next door for way way better food and we are more than happy to pay 20% tip for a better dining experience.\nWent here recently to see if anything had changed and ordered the turkey artichoke sandwich.  I used to order this one in past years.   What a got was a similar sandwich with spinach and turkey.  No artichoke.  I took it back to the counter and they said the artichoke is in there it is just in the sauce!   I should have refused it and ordered something else but I ate it and it was ok.   Very skimpy turkey portions in sandwich and mostly bread.   Way way overpriced for what I got.   This is really pathetic.\nThe interior is pretty clean and pleasant.  Many people like it for it's internet and coffee shop atmosphere I think and miss how crumby their actual food and service is.\nI now lower them to 1 star.\n\nupdate:  I stopped going to this place some time ago but returned because a friend insisted (above visit) and I won a 5 dollar gift card so I went there to use it up.\nWhen I got there a manager was about to explain to a customer why her receipt was rung up the way it was and she said she didn't care to know.   But the manager insisted on explaining the bill to which she reluctantly allowed him to finish.  \nNow when I am ordering at this place I am invariably asked again and again if I am ready to order.  Don't they see that I am looking at the menu which is hung behind them?  So I won't be ordering until I decide and when I decide I will know to walk up to the register to order.\nI decided to try the Ham and Turkey Panini because it was a little more expensive and one I had not tried in the past.  I think it was 8.25.  So with my card I spent  three and a quarter.   The sandwich came with a bag of chips.  It was a pretty large sandwich and the bread was good.  The ham was of somewhat ample portions but the turkey was skimpy and the cheese was almost non-existent.   What they do is shave the cheese paper thin and put two slices on the sandwich.   This is not what I call a good panini.  I give it about a 6 as it was fresh and tasted ok.  But it was nothing to rave about nor come back for.  It should have cost around 5 bucks for its simplicity and skimpiness.   \nLook at it this way.   I can buy a frozen dinner for 4 bucks which will have a protein, carb and vegetable and weigh in at about the same weight as the sandwiches I get from Panera.   But I have to pay double at this joint. \nSadly, Panera didn't used to be like this.   They used to have a turkey artichoke sandwich that was loaded with artichoke, turkey and cheese and the bread was delicious.   So someone came in and revamped all the food and wrecked the place.\nAmazingly this has not dampened the number of patrons.  What I think is happening here is that Panera has a type of coffeshop feel and people meet there for it's casual atmosphere without paying a lot of attention to the quality of their food.   They sit, they talk with friends and eat their food and just have a good time not realizing that they just got ripped off and made to wait on their own table!  I gotta hand it to them.

I've been here several times in the past, but I shan't be returning. \n\nWe ordered some appetizers, two in fact. Soup and some mac'n'cheese and bacon bite things (don't judge.) Only the soups arrived. The server was pretty good, and she apologized up and down, and offered free dessert. Hey, if I was going to have mac'n'cheese and bacon bites, who am I to turn down free dessert? \n\nBut before we even got to the dessert, we had to have the entree, which was nothing short of a big flop. I'll admit, I was scared the quiche I ordered was going to be a sliver of a thing, but this was a honking piece of egg pie. It wasn't particularly warm, however. And the salad that was served with it was terrible. Like it was bathed in the Gulf Coast (olive) oil slick. \n\nMy dining companion's entree fared even worse. The chicken whateveritwas was flavorless and was covered in a thick film of olive oil; the result of being plated with another one of Bluphie's \"tossed greens\" piles. And the mashed potatoes were, by all accounts, terrible. My dining companion is a mashed potato connoisseur, thus I am unable to account for their terribleness. In his words, \"this experience should be a testament to my love of mashed potatoes. They were so bad, but I ate all of them anyway.\" He said they were really crusty, like they'd been sitting in a chafing dish for hours. I'm no chef, but if there's one thing life experience has taught me, when mashed potatoes form a top crust, stir it up, and voila! Good as new. That couldn't even be bothered to have happened. \n\nSo we decided to split the offered complementary dessert, as neither of us was feeling too adventurous, in light of what we just experienced. We settled on carrot cake, which, in its defense, was massive. But that's where the defense ends. To be sure, the cake was fine. It wasn't dry. It featured a cream cheese(?) frosting. But it was topped with chopped walnuts that came from some form of freezer or refrigerator. My money is on a freezer. Have you ever stored walnuts in a freezer? Have you ever forgotten them so they freezer burned AND absorbed whatever flavors were mingling in the ecosystem of your freezer? Yes? Then you know the rancid taste of these nuts. It was beyond gross. We didn't finish the cake. \n\nThe decor of the joint is loud, and it's cavernous, and has lots of seating. The restaurant wasn't full by any accounts, but did seem to be \"bustling\". I simply don't understand why. It just wasn't good. As I mention above, I've eaten here in the past, and enjoyed it. It seems as though something has gone awry.

It came on it's own plate, with a side of mashed potatoes and broccoli on another plate.  The waitress brought out another plate as well, so we could share.  The meat was very fatty, but also very tender and moist - it was sitting in a pool of oil, which was slightly unappealing.  We picked away the fat and tried to eat the meaty parts.  The barbecue sauce had a slight kick to it, and was overly sodium heavy - an unnecessary but typical casualty of most food in most restaurants - I could tell I would be very thirsty later, and I would feel lousy and bloated because of this meal (In hindsight, I was right).  Why do I do this to myself?\n\nWe finished the rib, minus the 1/3 of it that was fat. Meanwhile, we ate the mashed potatoes and broccoli.  The potatoes were lumpy, with plenty of skin - I like that, but of course they were way too salty.  The broccoli came in very large pieces, was very salty and buttery, and was a tad undercooked - I guess that's better than overcooked.  With that said, what a boring side.  Color it up with some carrots or something, for presentation sake!  Interestingly, the broccoli and mashed potatoes were exactly the same as what one would receive at Monty's Blue Plate Diner.  I guess Foodfight Inc. shares their recipes across multiple venues - that's ok, provided what they serve is actually good.  \n\nThe service was completely uninspired and I didn't feel like it was appreciated that we chose to dine at their establishment.  This makes a difference to me.\n\nTab was $38 plus tip.  I would have felt better paying $28, any even better if we had skipped the experience all together and cooked at home.\n\nBot tome line - this is not high quality food, prepared healthily enough for anyone to eat regularly and still maintain a healthy lifestyle.  Foodfight should get a clue, and so should Madisonians who review this place highly.  If you can't tell already, I don't think highly of Bluephies, and for that matter, I don't have anything better to say about any Foodfight Inc. restaurant I've tried (most of them, although I'm starting to question why).  This is generally low quality food, prepared unhealthily, and it makes you feel like junk every time you eat it!

Furthermore to say it's an avocado extravaganza, well, let's just say I was over-enthusiastic.  Unfortunately my scrambler was overloaded with onions and the Andouille sausage was cheap hot dog quality which gave the scramble very little flavor.

The location on Flamingo is new and so the restaurant is clean, well organized and spiffy. Sweet Tomatoes is supposed to be a salad bar experience. The moment you walk in, there is a long line of salad fixings: prepared salads, greens, veggies (beets, corn etc), beans, pasta, croutons, dressings. After you fill up your plate, you pay for the meal: almost 9 bucks for lunch. Not too bad considering you can have unlimited goes at all the food. Towards the back of the restaurant there is the prepared foods sections: soups (about 5/6 daily), pastas, breads, baked potatoes, drinks, muffins and dessert. \n\nAlthough Sweet Tomatoes is always referred to as a \"salad place\" it's really not somewhere you want to go if you're in any sort of a diet. There is just way too many carby, cheese laden foods that unless you have self control (I have none), you're going to have a calorie fest. \n\nHaving said that, these are the things I like about Sweet Tomatoes at W. Flamingo (besides the above-mentioned spiffiness of the restaurant:\n\n1. Service - friendly wait staff, staff that clear the empty plates in a jiffy, general efficiency of the people who work there\n2. Labeling - They label their prepared dishes as \"vegetarian\" and sometimes even \"vegan.\" The website does an amazing job of letting you know what type of prepared foods each location has. Visit the site before going down to your Sweet Tomato experience\n3. Creativity - Props to them for trying. They had Asian Week this week and they've tried to have Asian inspired soups, noodles etc. Ummm...they had tofu available for \"Asian Week.\" I nearly went to heaven (until I saw a piece of what looked like ham in the tofu container - see my statement on separation)\n4. Soups - They have 6 soups and 2/3 of them are always veg/vegan\n5. The Garlic Focaccia Bread and Cornbread with Whipped Butter - Mmmmmm. \n\nCons:\n1. Taste - Honestly, nothing blew me away. The garlic focaccia and cornbread were the only things that came close to it. The soups were quite bland, the prepared salads were tasteless and the brownies were dry and tasted like diet food. With a menu of about 30 items, it's pretty incredible that there was only 2 items I liked\n2. Separation - Not sure how they could get around it, but they have meaty items with vege items in the same area and you do see some cross-contamination\n3. Crowd - This location was packed. Took me about 15 min to get from lettuce to spinach due to the 2 perfectly coiffed women in front of me deciding which green to eat\n4. Marketing - For a restaurant to claim that it's healthy and promoting veggies there is a lot of artery clogging options available. Tell it as it is.

They are made from scratch daily and there is a wide selection. I guess February is potato month, so on this particular visit, they had baked Sweet Potatoes. Yum! Yum! Yum! I didn't have any muffins on this visit, but those are usually great too, especially if you pair it with something from their excellent butter selection.\n\nBy the way, where else can you get a freakin tiny ass ice cream cone? They don't actually serve ice cream, but they have a frozen yogurt machine.

It's a myriad of unlimited salad items, endless soups, unlimited fountain drinks, and an infinity of hot carbs.  These restaurants have a monthly theme where they utilize in-season fruits/vegetables to create special dishes aside from their already existing menu items.  February's theme was potatoes (ex. cream of potato soup, potato salad, etc.).\n\nThe West Flamingo location is the newest Sweet Tomatoes in the area and even boasts outdoor seating that overlooks the great I-215 (also a great view of Home Depot).\n\nSALAD\nFresh pre-made caesars, pre-made cold pasta salads, pre-made broccoli salad, etc.  The salad bar also boasts tomatoes, cucumbers, spinach, lettuce, cauliflower, and tons of other veggies!  For the chef salad fans, they have feta and cheddar cheeses, hard-boiled egg, croutons, and a boat load of different salad dressings.  Grilled chicken is extra $.\n\nSOUP\nI've never really been a fan of their soups even though I've tried many of them :-\\.  Each restaurant has about 3-5 different soups.  \n\nHOT BAR  \nMac and cheese, Iike theirs because I like Kraft.  Perfect for the kiddies.  They also have at least one other hot pasta but don't ask me, because I stick to the Kraft.  While you're up there the have hot potatoes that you can load up, different bread sticks that are pretty yummy, and muffins!  OMG the blueberry muffins are to die for.  Put the honey butter on them--euphoria!\n\nDRINKS\nUnlimited of course, just like everything else.  They offer Coca Cola products and also have different iced teas and juices.  Mix and match you crazy barista!\n\nDESSERT\nI always stuff myself on the blueberry muffins, so I never visit the ice cream.  Yes, I said ISCREAM!  Dreyer's chocolate and vanilla, soft serve, if you will.  The sprinkles and chocolate sauce aren't just for the kiddies either, go ahead, I won't tell.

If you are looking for Vegas' signature buffet staples (crab legs, prime rib, endless shrimp, and stale pizza), you should not visit this place. When people say this is mostly for vegetarians, they are not kidding. First, there is a hefty salad bar, with build-your-own and pre-designed options. I tried the Asiago Ceasar Salad. It was absolutely delicious, I have to say. Not at all what I expected from this place. The dressing was tangy, mustardy, and the pieces of lettuce were not soggy. I went back for seconds. Then, as I tried to figure out what to have next, I realized that salads and soups were basically considered entrees. So, I tried the Dijon Chicken soup, and again, I was pleasantly surprised. It was full of flavor! I also had seconds. Then I saw my husband helping himself to some \"chunky chicken noodle soup\", and I decided to try that to. The thing is, that soup was lacking in flavor (only chicken - huge chunks of it - and noodles...no veggies). So, I filled my cup half way with Dijon Chicken soup, and topped with Chunky Chicken Noodle soup. Great combo! \n\nWe also helped ourselves to some of what they call bruscetta, though they look like pizzas. They were pretty good. We also tried their honey-wheat bread, and sourdough bread, both of which were very good. For dessert, I tried the chocolate lava cake, which was too sweet and not at all tasted like it was made with \"good\" ingredients. The blueberry muffins, however, were quiet tasty. \n\nAt the end, you sort of feel stuffed, but not really. I mean, you basically had little to no protein, and you're probably going to crave some a while later. If you're watching your weight, this is a great place to visit. They have all sorts of coupons, and I sort of felt like the only person ever to pay full price for dinner (about $27 for two adults' dinners, and two endless fountain drinks).

The selection of salad greens great (choose from head lettuce, organic mix greens, romaine greens, and one more think fresh spinach), and two prepared salad ceasars salad was one of them. The toppings is pretty diverse from raw vegetables, pasta salad, garnishes, and something NEW never notice before have premium topping that  can add too salad for price (honestly none of it looked that great too just ify spending more plus still the soups, mac/cheese, and more things the menu not even checked out yet). The salad dressings over ten different ones too choose one. Me generally italian dressing guy or creamy italian dressing. Once done with the salad get seated unfortunately being holiday ended up waiting ten mins at most. Still not that bad wait. The manager very friendly, and made the short wait go by easy.\n\nThe soups range for four too five usually vary from day too day. Most part there all pretty solid soups. I had the chili and the creamy mushroom soup on this visit. Both of the soups were good and hearty. Nice and hot perfect on cold day. The cornbread I LOVE it. Between Famous Dave and Sweet Tomatoes could be in cornbread bliss. I ended up getting four pieces of it!!!! The mac and cheese is good. It little on the running side which prefer more thick and cheesy one. Still works for me. The pizza is good but this visit ran out of room. \n\nAnother thing enjoy about Sweet Tomatoes is there lemonade. It says house made so assume the obvious. I enjoy the strawberry lemonade!

If you join their email club, they send you coupon specials and promos. Also, if you look in the newspaper, every now and then they have 2 for 1 specials. When its really packed, you have to wait for a host to find you a seat.\n\nOnce you sit down, you have other choices like different soups, breads, pasta, etc. Every month they usually have different themes like lemon month, which means a lot of the items have some kind of lemon influence like lemon cake or pomegranate lemonade fusions.\n\nSome random info: They have these card thingies at your table that indicates if you took off to go get more food or if you are done so the bussers know whether to clean your whole table or not.

My only complaint with this is there's really no way to tell which sandwich is which unless you peel back some of the bread to reveal the contents.  Some places put a numbered sticker on their sandwiches to match the items on your receipt.  The boxes at Panera have a place you could write the name.

Yesterday, I ordered the Frontega Chicken Panini (chopped basil, chipotle sauce, red onions and chicken fillet on foccacia bread) with cheddar broccoli soup (my favorite) while mommy ordered the Turkey Breast Sandwich with French Onion Soup. On top of it, we shared a couple packets of chips to go with the meal.\n\nService was very fast despite a large crowd. Our orders arrived on our tables within 3-5 minutes of waiting. They provide their diners with an electronic table locator which helps staff navigate their way through the restaurant, finding customers who change seats.

I ordered a full sandwich w/ French bread-like bread on the side, a cup of soup w/ apple on the side and a regular drink. The side came with each item I ordered.  I thought it was like a fast food type of environment but they handed me a number so I sat down. The cashier recommended that I get a REWARDS card with Panera so I can start receiving deals. I didn't hesitate because I enjoy collecting reward cards from different stores I go to. The server brought my food to the table. I started off by dipping my bread into my cup of soup. The bread was very fresh and soft that it practically melted in my mouth. It was that GOOOOD! I was full by the time I was done with half my sandwich, cup of soup and the bread on the side. Next time I'll know to order a half a sandwich, soup and bread on the side. NOW while I was waiting for my food to be served, I went on my phone and registered my rewards card. At the end, it indicated that I can claim my FREE cookies or pastry. I waited until I was done eating before I went back to the cash register. When I showed my card, the cashier swiped it and she said that I can pick anything from the cookie/pastry area. I chose a Cinnamon Roll. This Cinnamon Roll was huge. It was like approx. 5-6 inches. If I were to just buy the Cinnamon Roll by itself, it would cost over $3.00 each. Man, don't get me started on the Cinnamon Roll!!! My goodness!!!!!

In my opinion the food is a little bit pricey for the quantity, type of food, and preparation effort you are getting. I paid $12 for a half a sandwich, a bowl of french onion soup, and a soda. Was not so impressed with this particular location. Spoon was not very clean and had water spots, sandwich was very tiny and falling apart (3 big bites for a guy), and soup was just warm. I asked for the soup croutons on the side and they gave me about 4 croutons in a soup container. They didn't even bother to cut my bread in half. They just ripped a chunk off the loaf. I do however like how Panera Bread uses real cuts of turkey, and not the thin sliced pressed stuff.\n\nService/Ambiance: I like how the cashiers are separate from food preparation area. As busy as this location was, the cashier took the time to answer my questions and offer and explain to me about their rewards card. The customer service was spot on and everyone was friendly, but the food took forever to come out. This location cannot keep up with the amount of people that are coming through. Tables were dirty, floors had trash, trash cans were over flowing. Parking lot was packed.

Walker building in downtown Phoenix.  It seems a little incongruous that this fine piece of - \"neo-classical greek architecture\", should host a \"mere\" sub shop, in this building that was once slated to be the 6 story local HQ for J.C. Penny. The quality, convenience, cleanliness and comfortable atmosphere of Stickers, coupled with it's continued popularity, success, and legions of loyal customers I think however does the old building proud. They stopped at 2 stories but intended tenant JCP moved in anyway for some years, before it became the APS building, and then occupied by various other tenants over the years.  \n\nNow as to the food!  I confess  am not that huge a fan of subs in general except as economical filler, but I'd have to say that Stickler's has the best I've ever tasted, and that's not damning with faint praise; It's excellent!  I've come here only sporadically over the last decade of the nearly dozen years I've worked nearby, but only recently, based on reviews below, was I prompted to try the \"Traffic Jam\", for which I thank all responsible and I concur with the overwhelming majority: it's delicious!  Roast turkey, hard salami, honey baked ham and roast beef with swiss.  Add a little lettuce & tomato, oil & vinegar, a squirt of mayo, Italian seasoning, and maybe just a very few jalapenos due to the delicate gringo stomach to the  soft whole wheat roll, and you've got a filling piece of heaven on wheat.  Add a side and a drink and it starts getting a bit expensive for my lunch budget, but as for me, I'm satiated for the rest of the day. Like some of those below, I don't care for those roof-of-the-mouth raking breads either, but though I don't think they make it in house, you couldn't have anything much fresher or softer than the whole wheat sandwich roll (white Kaiser roll - you're on your own!).   \n\nSticklers is I think a tad more expensive than Subway on comparable items, and I'm just fine with Subway, but there's no doubt that Stickler's is superior in taste.  I met co-owner Murray this past week and asked him what made the difference - what makes their sandwiches that much distinctively better.  Without hesitation he answered \"the meat\".  And though not an exact quote, he also said \"That $2.99 a pound stuff that you buy from the grocery deli counter? We don't buy that.  Our's is more in the $5.99 area, and we slice it thin and layer it.   And I've got a great staff down here too, and I have to give thanks to them.\"  I liked that.  And the tuna, and the Traffic Jam, and the roast beef, and every other sandwich I've tried there over the years.\n\nService is fast and efficient.  You order at a walk-up counter on the east side where you can order your soup and sub, or choose a have a fresh salad assembled for you from the myriad offerings on the other side of the glass.  Staff does the assembling and at easily $8, it's not a cheap little side salad, but everything looks vibrantly fresh and the whole of downtown is not poking and sneezing in it.  Subs are made right out in the open so you can supervise if you want. but after ordering you walk around to the front counter, wait for your sub to come off the toasting rack and then specify what you want on it, order any drinks and sides, and pay. Cash, credit and debit cars are accepted. Would not say \"good for groups\", since no reservations accepted and no separate dining rooms or divisible areas available\n\nIn moderate weather Sticklers offers simple but comfortable plastic chair seating out front under the shade of the building's second story overhang that overlooks the busy streets at 3rd Ave & Washington.  There's also moderately shaded seating all along  the west side of the building with a view to the front of the adjacent Phoenix Municipal Court building that towers, looms, etc., over Sticker's modest 2-stories. \n\nBins abound to dump your own debris, but staff roams continually at the lunch hour(s) to take care of that left behind. Restrooms are toward the back on the east side and at least the men's room is surprisingly large and includes 3 stalls including handicapped, one urinal, a baby changing station and small counter with sink and mirror.  The facility was well stocked with TP, paper towels, and hand soap even right after the big lunch hour, and there was no mess other than a few paper towels on the floor beneath the dispenser, and a bit of water on the counter around the sink.    \n\nThe 1-star review that spoke of rude wait staff, unwelcome gratuities, and a bad shrimp & lobster sandwich has been corrected by the author as a mistaken posting (wrong place), which I think leaves but one, 1-star remaining, which gives the establishment 1 star due to a single bad latte.

Their juices are jammed packed with medicinal whole foods and offer herbal shots/boosts to your drink.  I was happy to find the use of cucumber as a base instead of the sugary tastes when using apples or carrots.  \nTheir produce is local, fresh and organic. Juicing with locally grown produce is optimal for the body as it lives and thrives within the same environmental zen. Additionally, they compost all of their waste from the juicing.\n\nIf you are interested in healing your body, sleeping better at night, having more energy without the side effects of caffeine and energy drinks then I recommend Kaleidoscope.  The ingredients of their juices have a much more profound effect on the body because many of their herbs and plants restore the liver, gallbladder, heart and tonify the internal organs and clean the blood.  \n\nTheir recipes help bring the body back to the source of its purpose; to live healthier.  \n\nBecause they juice organic, I can drink without worries that their products were not grown in pesticide ridden soil.  If it's not organic then you might as well order a cucumber, kale,and spinach pesticide juice because that is exactly what the produce is when not grown organic.  The pesticide is in the soil as the plants grows and so, pesticide is embedded within the entire plant. \n\nAfter I got addicted to their juices within a week, I decided to do the 7-day cleanse.

If you do, don't go to Sweet Tomatoes.\n\nSince you are still reading this review, you are probably thinking \"it had better be a special salad bar\".  Well it is.  Sort of.  Here's what you are going to get:\n\nThe Salad Bar Itself: this contains a large variety of items but nothing outstanding.  There are a few prepared salads and some specialities like country potato salad.  The big plus here is that you get so many choices that you will be able to build just what you want, so long as what you want is not chicken or hearts of palm, etc., for which they charge extra.\n\nThe Soup Bar: this is the high point for Sweet Tomatoes.  You have eight choices, about half of which are vegetarian.  Chicken Noodle has huge pieces of white meat chicken, and there are usually at least a couple of soups that rate an A.\n\nPasta, Potatoes, Bread: the freshest items are the pastas, which they make in small batches.  There will be two or three, but unless you think that mediocre mac & cheese is worth dying for, these are not worth looking for.  The baked potatoes and sweet potatoes are ok but no more.  They have a few breads, incuding a couple of foccacios which are not bad (I will say no more).\n\nDesserts:  This is what you get -- soft serve ice cream in two flavors and a few desulatory toppings, a couple of dishes of cut fruit, jello, and a half-dozen types of standard muffins.  They also have one warm specialty dessert each day, such as a chocolate lava cake or a fruit cobbler.  This is usually a cut above average -- try it first.  \n\nSweet Tomatoes is a comfortable place to eat, albeit a bit crowded and noisy -- lots of kids.  It is clean, bright, and in good repair.  It is also busy, especially around 6-7 pm, but they handle it fairly well.

I work next door and have been teased by the \"Coming Soon\" sign for what feels like an eternity! Well, the day had finally come, March 5, the GRAND OPENING of my new breakfast and lunch hot spot. \n\nGrand opening I was so happy they were finally open. My coworkers and I walked on over for some breakfast. I ordered a Four Cheese souffle and a medium Americano. They were pretty quick, happy to see you, greeted with a smile. Score! I'm happy now. Got our food and walked back over to our office. Coffee was great, I'm eating my souffle....there's a hunk of something in it that I bite down on. Upon further inspection of said souffle, there are artichokes in it. Ok, no biggie, I just didn't realize there were artichokes in the four cheese one....and upon inspecting the site, there's not. They had incorrectly given me the Spinach and Artichoke one. Not an awful mistake, except it's 70 calories more and I ordered the Four Cheese because it was lower in calories.\n\nLunch, let's just head on over and we can regain our excitement of Panera being next door. I decide on the Power Mediterranean Roasted Turkey Salad. Looks super tasty, super healthy and again I am happy! We get our lunch and head on back over to our office. I open up my lunch...what a cute box. A little disappointed because from outside the little boxed window it doesn't look very big. Not very big at all for a $9 salad. Oh well, I open it up and stop in my tracks. There's some turkey, cool; olives, check; no lemon juice, but 2 olive oils; and spinach, like less than 20 leaves. I move aside the spinach looking for more and I just get the bottom of the cardboard box....where's the rest of it. There's no \"salad\" in my salad. Now I'm totally bummed. I call over, more-so to let them know the kitchen might have a hiccup and the Manager tells me they want to make it right, to come on over and they'll fix it. At this point, there's a line out of the door and we just agree to take care of it the next day. \n\nPanera isn't all it's cracked up to be so far. BUT....they have promised to make it right!! And now here we are. Walked on over this morning, spoke with the Manager who once again apologized. No biggie, bumps in the road, it happens.

She comped my breakfast and coffee, the order got put in, we're golden right? Grab my bag, we walk on back. Sit down at my desk, mmmm steak and eggs and avacado and.....at this point is where you hear the screeching halt of tires. I get that things in real life don't look like stuff in the professional photographs, but they didn't even try. For some reason my breakfast was on salad (maybe that's making up for the lack of it from the lunch) the \"Two all-natural eggs, freshly cracked every morning\" were actually just two ice cold egg white patties. Gross. And their \"seared steak\", well that was a cold chewy mess as well. I couldn't even stomach it.

The layout of the restaurant is confusing, unorganized and downright uncomfortable.  It's hard to explain but once you order your food you have to wait in this tight, long hallway next to the kitchen where servers run into you to grab food and bring it to some of the tables. At one point the line was so long to wait for food some of the people I was next to had to step outside because it was hot and making them claustrophobic.   Honestly I didn't blame them.  I snapped a quick photo after they had just stepped away which doesn't quite show how tight it was but it will give you an idea of the space I'm talking about.\n\n- Quality of my food was less than epic.  I ordered a pick 2 (soup and half sammy).   The most disappointing part was my \"French onion\" soup.  Normally FO soup comes topped with cheesey goodness and some crunchy bread.   I literally got watery brown broth with onion strips.  Nothing else.       Either they forgot how to make it or ran out of ingredients?

The cheese was supposedly gorgonzola.  There was very little of it, and it was not very strong.  I could barely tell that it was in the salad.  The dressing was odd, not a typical cobb salad dressing.  Also, I believe Cobb Salad typically has chopped egg in it and there was no egg.  Maybe they don't use it.

A nice bakery to keep your sweet tooth satisfied and your belly full. More specifically though. I despise this location.\n\nI have been to this location a bunch of times (over 20 at least) and every time I go it seems the same kind of disappointing experience. A couple examples:\n\n First of all the first time I went here in my life I was still in high school and was here just doing some homework. Not one single table was clean so I cleaned it myself. I went to the front and ordered some soup, a coffee, and a water and got to work on some un-important  English paper that I would never remember. The second I opened my laptop to start working, an employee comes over and very rudely says \"how old are you? you can't sit here all night  doing homework.\" Keep in mind I had only a few sips from my soup and coffee when she arrived in front of me. \n\nI look up and say excuse me? So she repeats herself. I said well I am a paying customer and you have free wifi, so if people are welcome to use free wifi and you have coffee and a bakery, what kind of place is this? She proceeded to say that they were a Fast-food Restaurant and that she didn't want to get stuck there after her shift to clean my table. I told her not one of these tables were cleaned when I sat down. She grunted and said \"yeah right\" and trotted away. So, having felt extremely disrespected; packed up my laptop and homework, left my full cup of coffee along with the water and full bowl of soup and walked to the front cash register where her, and her manager were standing. As I walk up I even hear her bitching to her manager about me sitting and doing homework. \n\nShe notices me out of the corner of her eye and immediately stops talking and walks into the back. So I say, \"too late\". I tell the manager I want my money back for what she had just said to me while I was sitting down. I said I did not feel welcome and would like to take my money elsewhere. The manager agreed but only because I had walked up on them talking about me. I got my money back and said I left my entire meal at my table and left. I couldn't believe it.\n\nQuickly 2 others, one for some reason one of the booths was just missing an entire bench. so their replacement was a random chair which I will try to put in the pictures section of this location. Also I just went here today and ordered and just got a very \"hurry up so I can do nothing\" response. No thank you just here is your change and move on.\n\nAgain I love Panera but this location is just awful, over crowded, rude employees, and just a lack of convenience to customers (i.e. fixing a booth, cleaning tables, etc.)", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Panera: it is what it is.  \n\nA perfectly adequate place for coffee, a sandwich, pastries, whatever.

I have always said 'I don't like salads.'  Sweet Tomatoes, heretofore known as ST, has turned me onto the green leafy goodness that is so versatile!  I'm a fan of ST's Wonton Chicken Salad (I think that's the one).  I don't know what it is about this fixed salad that makes me crave it for days--weeks even--after I've last eaten there.  I'm convinced it's the seasoning.   I experienced said deliciousness by accident:  the first time I was taken to eat at ST, the guy in line ahead of me filled his entire plate, and left enough of a serving for me (he seemed to feel bad to empty the entire bowl on the bar).  Observing his pillage, I tried what remained of the Wonton Chicken Salad and have been hooked since!  In hindsight, that dude knew exactly what he was doing!  \n\nTo back up a moment, you walk into ST and immediately sanitize your hands.  At least you should as two sanitization stations are located on each end of the salad bar line.  Cleanliness is part of ST's company culture and it's not going to kill you.  You get a tray and proceed down the salad bar line.  There's the usual salad fixing fare plus the fancier stuff so don't stop at just my suggestion.  You can always go back for more.  ST offers the usual iced or hot teas, sodas and coffee, but definitely try the strawberry lemonade.  Just do it; don't question.  It pairs quite nicely with my fixed salad of choice.  Two adults can eat dinner there for about $26.00.  For a healthy buffet plus soup bar and bakery, plus drink refills, you're getting a pretty good price.  \n\nAs you pay and exit the salad bar, you choose where you sit.  The atmosphere is warm and family-friendly.  The decor is soft colors:  oranges, reds and greens.  I feel cozy in there.  There are servers who--bless them--bring around chocolate chip cookies for each patron.  You can buy those same cookies pre-packaged for two bucks or less at 13 cookies, but if you think about it, you can make your own for that same price if you pick up the ingredients at Wal-Mart.  Still, it's awfully cozy having someone bring you chocolate chip cookies.  \n\nThe soup bar is in the back near the bakery and ice cream station.  I love the tomato basil bisque but to my disappointment, that item is only served in the fall.  There are 10 or so other options so there's not a lot of room for disappointment.  Currently, ST is serving this chocolate lava cake which is shockingly not too sweet or overly filling because it's more of a muffin than cake.  I seriously doubt its sugar-free but I believe some of ST's options are more in line with a diabetic's diet.  No matter how full I am, I always squeeze in a blueberry muffin.  They're warm no matter what time I go and perfectly blueberry-sweetened.  In addition to the sweeter items, there are soft bread sticks, wheat biscuits, and other bread & bakery fare choices.  I can't imagine anyone being entirely disappointed with the offerings even though the menu varies a little day to day and season by season.  Nothing wrong with spicing things up a bit, in my opinion.  \n\nLeave a tip for the server if you're so inclined or deserving of it (i.e.picked up your empty plates and dishes and brought you cookies).  If time is an issue, you can also take out from ST and I believe they serve family style take-out as well.

I would go to one star if it was based on service and the other items they serve alone. The salad bar has a good selection of toppings and dressings. But they should get rid of the premium toppings. The items you get for another $2.50 and are just not worth it. I also do not see why we have to pay extra for drinks. With the cost of a beverage added it brings the cost above that of other buffets in town. Other pretty good buffets. If it weren't for the salad and soups I would not go at all. The soup is always pretty good and I just love the chili. It does not seem to be consistent, but always good.\n\nThis last visit the line we ware in was just stopped. We stood in line for over ten minutes while the other line was processed and seated. People that came in long after my wife and I were seated well before we were. It seems there was a large party at the front of our line and they had them stand there waiting to be seated. When we got to the front of the line we asked to talk to a manager and the lady behind the counter said she was one and how could she help. We explained what had happened and she said she could not do anything about it and we needed to speak to the people doing the seating. Excuse me! A manager has no control over how the staff is working? That does not seem right. Once we were seated we did talk to someone who was a manager and she was very thoughtful. She even gave us coupons for a free visit.\n\nAnother thing I do not understand is there fresh fruit bar. It consisted of whole apples, grapes and oranges. The other items were chocolate pudding, jello, and another pudding I could not identify. Fresh fruit? I don't think so.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "If you've never been to this chain, here's my basic buffet-exploration strategy: get one plate of stuff in the salad line, take small amounts of anything you want to try, then sample any soups, bread items, or pastas that you think you'd like. Only after that should you go back for seconds. I think I ignored the perhaps underrated soups too much in my early days, but I'm making up for it these days, and the classic shrimp bisque (seasonal item) was quite good, as was the chili. Throw in your choice of toppings such as oyster crackers and cheese and you've got quite a treat. Watch out for the chicken pot pie stew next week or in the future too, and if they ever bring back that golden yam bisque, mm mm!\n\nDon't forget dessert. They have pretty good fruit, but I always flock to the fro-yo. Dreyer's/Edy's is the best frozen yogurt that I've ever had at any sort of buffet, and there's some decent toppings available (although I still mourn the loss of toffee bits).\n\nI've been to this location 3 or 4 times, but I haven't bothered to write a review before for some reason. On one of those visits, I remember being fairly impressed that the employees sang happy birthday to someone here, so that was nice. The big plus side of this location is the granola breakfast cereal that they serve on Sunday mornings (along with the rest of their breakfast menu, which I highly recommend). I haven't seen the granola anywhere else. The big minus is that it's the least spacious of all the locations that I've been to, even to the point that they didn't have tuna tarragon for some reason this morning. I thought that they'd always carry this classic, which is one of my favorites pre-mixed salads, but nooo.... Also, they were out of tortillas for some reason when we first got here and wanted breakfast burritos, but they brought them out later.\n\nIn spite of not feeling good enough about this location to bestow upon it all 5 stars, I'm always very happy to eat here and I hope that I'll introduce a lot of friends soon.\n\nP.S.

Tonight we came to Sweet Tomatoes because of the value and location.  Salad, soup and dessert bar was about $10.99.  Now this place wouldn't be the first choice when I think of great grub, but my decision was out numbered.  Here's what I thought:\n\nAMBIANCE:  The place is like a buffet joint.  You walk in, grab your tray and plate and then you start building your salad.  The decor isn't something to be excited about.  This place tries to fill a lot of people in a such a small space so there's not much of privacy, even at your table.  \n\nFOOD:  Although the ingredients are super fresh, the salad bars were sloppy and food was everywhere.  I also appreciate that there's a huge selection of salad fixings, however, I can't stand the fact that places like Sweet Tomatoes tries to upsale and already high priced buffet with \"premium toppings,\" like chicken or artichokes.  C'mon!  Get out of here with that.  Like any other buffet out there, it should be included.\n\nI thought their premade Chinese chicken salad tasted good.  It was sweet and offered great texture with the won tons.  The Dill Potato Salad was really bland and not too good.  When it came to the soups, I loved the clam chowder and turkey chili.  I also love the fact that they have an area with all the possible toppings for your soup.  Remember that when you come here, do not miss out on the pizza type bread they have there.  It's located between the pasta and the soups.  SOOOO GOOOD!!\n\nApril, apparently, was their \"Lemon month.\"  They served things like lemon muffins, a lemon pasta with capers and lemon molten lava cake.  The molten cake was way too tart for my taste buds.\n\nLastly, for dessert, I LOVE and LOOK FORWARD to their soft served ice cream.  You can choose to put your ice cream in a bowl or small cones.  They also have caramel or chocolate sauce and a bunch of toppings.  YUM-O.  Last night, I think I actually got full from all the desserts they have.\n\nAll in all, I think this place is alright.  In a city filled with buffets, many of which are worth the price, unfortunately, I don't think Sweet Tomatoes fits in that same value.

In this case of Sweet Tomatoes you get picked over greens, a bunch of Sysco cheapest product possible bulk food service toppings, more bulk food type salad dressing, and all set in a decor that is circa 2010 but yet would not feel out of place in 1982.

There were tons of kids running amuck thru the line as well putting their hands on everything. One kid had an entire plate full of just boiled egg crumbles and was running up and down the line with no parents in sight. Where are the parents or management/staff to control this kind of stuff?

The foccacia and pizza bread was just the crusty outter layer that no one ever seems to take. The pastas were crusty and dry looking. So much for my appetite. After eating our salad and little bread/muffins that weren't old looking we went in for some of their gooey chocolate cake. Again only the outside rim of it was left and it was rock hard.

If you're looking for a comparison to somewhere more established; think Paradise Bakery, but take away the coffee and baked goods and replace it with a much bigger meal selection, and lower prices.  Like most Paradise locations, McAlister's has its customers order at the register, gives a number, and brings the food to them.\n\nI had the New Yorker (corned beef, pastrami, swiss and spicy mustard on rye) with a side of potato salad.  Very good.  Not close to anything you'd find in a New York deli, but on par with anything I'd expect from a sandwich shop.  The potato salad was pretty good as well.  My fianc\u00e9 went with the choose two (half orders of two menu items) with a grilled chicken sandwich (comes with lettuce, tomato, and honey mustard on a croissant) and a baked potato.  Both were delicious.\n\nWe both also had the tea (the sweet tea appears to be something McAlister's is known for).  Not being a big sweet tea fan, I asked for half unsweetened.  This worked out well for me.  If you're a sweet tea fan, you'll probably love the real thing.\n\nMcAlister's staff is very welcoming and friendly.  Maybe a little too friendly.  The soda and tea fountains are behind the counter, but they have no problem refilling your drink for you.  In fact, a worker will pass your table and ask if you want a refill.  Several times.  It almost felt like they were looking for something to do.   But it's nice and unexpected service, so I will not complain.\n\nThe one thing I will complain about is the menu board.  It either needs be moved up or reprinted much bigger.  The meals are listed in white font against a black background.  While the names are easy to read, the descriptions are small and are tough on the eyes.  I'm 32, my fianc\u00e9 is 27, and we both had to look at a takeout menu instead of steer at the board.

I spun in around 1130 on a workday for a to-go lunch sandwich.   \nThe menu is fairly extensive and follows the same theme as a Paradise Bakery, but with way more sandwiches.\n\nPeople seem to love this place, but for me, I got a very \"corporatized\" feel from my first impression.  The kitchen is hidden from view, with only a small window into the prep area, which the food is passed through.  Service is quick and friendly.  I chose the \"Memphian\",  which is described as:\n \"Black Angus roast beef, Black Forest ham, Butterball\u2122 \nsmoked turkey, provolone, lettuce, tomatoes, lite mayo and \nspicy brown mustard on a toasted 6\" wheat hoagie.\"\n\nand I ordered a side of coleslaw to go with it.  they have a variety of sides from coleslaw to potato salad, mac salad or mac and cheese to select from.  The sandwich came out shortly and I tossed it in my saddlebag to spin off back to work.\n\nWhen I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.  The bread was soft and doughy, like it had been microwaved, the meat was skimpy, but the worst part was the lettuce.  There was a big, black-edged hole of rotting lettuce in it.  This tells me a couple of things, one - they did not properly clean their lettuce.  One would think with all the fear of e-coli coming from vegetables that there would be a stronger effort to clean the vegetables.  Two, the quality-control sucks.  this piece of lettuce should have never gone out of the kitchen.  Both of these clues tell me the kitchen is either not managed, or it is run by somebody that does not care.  Prolly not a good thing when there is so much competition around this area, but hey, it is what it is.\n\nI did not find the sandwich especially pleasing, and the small container of cole-slaw was only half-full, again, sending the corporatized-portion-controlled message.

It's been not only that but a place of longing that various co-workers have agreed that when we hear some Chet Baker or otherwise lounge-jazz music that we'd \"rather be at Panera.\"  It's reliable, the food is always good, and I always know what to expect.\n\nThat said - for those who aren't in the know of Panera, get out from under your rock and get in the 'know!  Panera is a light lunch/breakfast eatery that offers a bakery with morning bites, with jazz music floating throughout.  It's a hit with all ages, offering free wi-fi, and its very popular with everyone from children to seniors.  They have a you pick two deal which allows you to mix and match a variety of things from the whole soup/salad/sandwich/etc so you can get a pretty sweet combo for just six-ish bucks.

A second is coming soon to Summerlin. Cafe Zupas has had great success in Utah and Arizona. They offer homemade soups, freshly made salads, paninis, and gourmet sandwiches. I was fortunate to receive an invite to a VIP party that allowed Frank and I to sample various menu items. All guests were warmly welcomed and encouraged to sample the Try 2 Combo, which comes with a whole sandwich, half soup and half salad for $7.99. The Kid's Meal Combo is $3.99.\n\nSalads are made in front of you as you order, soups are made fresh daily in Cafe Zupas' kitchen, and sandwiches are fixed when you place your order. It is quite the assembly line. I chose the Tomato Basil soup with Orzo Pasta, topped with asiago cheese for .59, their signature salad Nuts About Berries and Turkey Spinach Artichoke Panini. Frank had the Yucatan Chicken Tortilla soup, the BBQ Chicken salad, and the the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich. They got started on our orders right away, all components were added to our tray, we selected Brownies for dessert and our order came with Belgian Chocolate Covered Strawberries. By the time you pay your tab (ours was gratis on this visit), your order is complete and ready to be whisked away to a cozy table in the dining room.  \n\nWe dug into the soups first, the Tortilla soup is fantastic and loaded with flavor. It was so tasty Frank devoured it before I could snap a photo. The Tomato Basil was good, but less of favorite. It's quite sweet and very heavy on basil flavor. I hear the Wild Mushroom Bisque is not to be missed so I'll try that one next time.\n\nNext, we tried the salads, I had the better of two with Nuts About Berries. It was loaded with fresh berries and topped with cinnamon almonds and lightly dressed with poppyseed dressing. It' a bit sweet, but not cloying so it was enjoyable. The BBQ Chicken salad was loaded with tomatoes, black beans, corn, olives, red onion and dressed with buttermilk ranch. What it lacked was BBQ chicken. There are ten other salads to choose from one is sure to strike your fancy.\n\nUnfortunately, the sandwiches were the weakest link. This is a shame because their Italian Ciabatta bread is really fresh and delicious. The BBQ Pulled Pork tasted more like honey mustard that BBQ. It wasn't a very hearty sandwich. Sadly, the turkey wasn't very good. It tasted like prepackaged deli meat. I prefer freshly sliced deli meats. I expected actual artichokes on the sandwich, but it was a spread. That was my mistake, the menu clearly states a three cheese artichoke spread. I overlooked it. Truly, the bread is so good, I'd try the gourmet sandwiches again. I'm interested in the Asian BBQ Pork and the Vegetarian.\n\nDessert ended the meal on a pleasant note. I love Belgian Chocolate Dipped Strawberries so those alone wooed me, but the brownies were quite good and oh, so decadent. Gooey caramel and candy topped one and the other was more of a bar with coconut, nuts, chocolate and other goodness. \n\nThe staff was incredibly friendly, they gave out dozens of prizes including water bottles and giftcards.

While Subway focuses on the sandwich, this place offers soups, salads, and sandwiches, which is ok.  (Note: Before I go to a restaurant, I usually look at the menu so I know what I'm going to order when I get to the place.  I was disappointed to see that for the CYO Salad, while they had a decent variety of dressings/lettuces/toppings/etc. to choose from, they were pretty limiting to how many toppings you can choose!  What about those people who wants lots of vegetable toppings and not just 4?) Regardless, I decided to try it out tonight.  I have to admit that I'm not terribly happy with my first time here.  Having had nursed an upset stomach for the past few days, I decided to go with a vegetable soup with a clear broth and the vegetarian sandwich.  The soup was pretty salty.  That's about all I can say about it.  The sandwich wasn't too bad, but I wasn't too impressed with it.

I love that you can see all of the ingredients, everything is so fresh and colorful, it really adds to the experience. We were pushed expeditiously through the line and found a table despite it being packed. I really enjoyed the Asian BBQ sandwich, it definitely had a kick to it but it had a good fresh flavor too. I instantly fell in love with the cauliflower soup, it was so creamy and rich, mmmmmm perfection! I like that they give you a piece of bread to dip in the soup, but it was overkill with my sandwich. I loved ending my meal with a chocolate covered strawberry, such a simple touch but a great way to end any meal. \n\nI was so impressed that I decided to go back that weekend with my husband. This time I tried the pulled pork sandwich and of course the cauliflower soup again. The pulled pork had honey mustard and cabbage on it. I don't normally enjoy honey mustard, but I thought all of the flavors worked well together. My husband had the clam chowder and the Italian sandwich. The clam chowder had a lot of black pepper in it, which wasn't my favorite, but he enjoyed it. The Italian sandwich, on the other hand, was great and I really enjoyed their homemade balsamic dressing.\n\nOverall, I think this is a really great lunch option. Everything is fresh and made to order.

So far, all of the soups that I have tried are excellent: Shrimp & Sausage Gumbo, Mushroom Bisque (vegetarian), Lobster Bisque, and New England Clam Chowder.

During lunch time, expect a crazy busy establishment. Upon just parking, you can already see the lines through their windows.

Zupas was no different.\n\nAfter finally getting parked, you walk in.  The line is organized somewhat like what you see at Disneyland (minus the fast pass).  However, the line for ordering does go pretty quick.  Your food is built in an assembly like fashion starting with your salads, sandwiches, soup, and finally desserts. The place is packed and the other concern is whether or not you will even have a seat.  Go ahead and try to save a table.  Can't do it, it's not allowed.  They even have signs posting that you cannot save a table.  This wasn't a problem since there's was at least 3 tables opened when we ate. But I'm sure there are days where seating in limited. \n\nAs for their food, I got their Turkey Spinach Artichoke Panini with their Lobster Bisque.  The soup portions are huge and the food portions are just okay.  My sandwich wasn't bad, actually was pretty good.  It's the soup that I rave about.  The the price and taste of their lobster bisque rivals other sitdown, more expensive restaurants.  Just wish there was thick pieces of lobster in there.  My total order came up to about $10 which included the sandwich, soup, drink, a strawberry, and a lunch roll.  \n\nPrices are about average for the rest of the menu, but they do have a lunch special for $7.99.  This includes sandwich and half soup.  By the way, if you have a sweet tooth, then you have to try their desserts. I'm not saying it's good, because for one, I don't have a sweet tooth. And two, I didn't have any.  The presentation looks good. I guess I will just have to wait for someone else's review to see how good the sweets truly are.

The interior is nice enough with a lot of seating, booths and tables. \n\nI'm not thoroughly impressed because for one the salad I ordered failed completely on pretty much every level except for that fact that is was HUGE and way too much of it for me to eat in one sitting, especially since I had ordered a salad/soup combo.

Overall this salad is a huge let-down. Try a different salad other than this one.\n\nLobster Bisque - Decent enough soup, decent enough portion. I finished the soup, mainly because I wasn't thrilled with the salad. They have saltine crackers AND the cute little clam crackers available by the drink station for your soups. I though this soup was all right for the fact its Lobster Bisque at a quick dining spot.

It definitely has a the new business feeling to it. As soon as you walk in you can tell that everything is brand new and clean. Most definitely give them 5.0 Star for the over all view of this location. However, the concept is a little confusing. You pick either a soup and sandwich, soup and salad, or a sandwich and salad. When you are in line you kind of have to jump ahead of people depending on what meal you choose or you have to go to the end of the line again. \n\nCustomer Service:\nCustomer service at this location is decent. After looking at the menu, you get in line and the first person asks if they can make you a salad or a sandwich. Once you have chosen your salad and/or sandwich you choose your soup if that is your other entree. They give you testers for the soup (great choices for meat eaters, vegetarians, and vegans). Once you have gotten your entree you get a big piece of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry (which is DELICIOUS) and an extra charger for your drink if you choose to get one. \n\n**********As my first time here I was excited to try this place because my parents have gone to this location several times and have experienced great service. I am not sure if the young man was confused but my boyfriend and I ordered the same thing and we actually wind up missing a sandwich. So we waited about 5 minutes and no one said anything. After we told a manager at the cash register about the other sandwich that we were missing she took care of it right away. \n\nQuantity/Quality:\nThe Honey Bacon Club sandwich is a good choice. It has a sweet taste from honey mustard. The bacon is crispy The turkey and ham slices are tender. I got the New England Clam Chowder. I added bacon bites to my soup and it most definitely is a great choice of soup. The quality of the food is definitely fresh and great. I would have to say that the quality of the food here is just as good as a 5 Star High End restaurant.

My lunch today was far from stellar.  Here is a basic breakdown-\n\n1. This place now has a \"B\" from the SNHD.  I almost turned around and left based on that.  How hard is it to keep it clean and store your food properly?\n\n2. The ordering process is a lesson in inefficiency.  Too many hands in the cookie jar.  They had eight employees behind the line and I bet they can do better with four.  First you have to tell the salad person what you want.  Then you have to tell a sandwich person what you want, and then you have to tell the soup person what you want.  After all this, you now have to repeat the order to someone organizing it.  Finally, you have to repeat your order AGAIN to the person checking you out.  Seriously?  Who thought of this?  Why on earth can't you just order everything from the first person and then pay without having to repeat it all?  It's called a POS system, use it!\n\n3. I have been here about a dozen times.  After the second visit, I quit ordering sandwiches altogether.  They are as hard as rocks, bland, and comprised of cold cuts I can buy at any grocery store.\n\n4. The salads are large, even for a half size, and a good deal.  Nothing off the charts, but good.  I mean, it is a salad.\n\n5. The soups are good as well, except on a few occasions.  My tomato soup today had an aftertaste of seafood.  This may be where the \"B\" from the food inspection comes into play.  They are likely not storing their soups properly, or mixing utensils.  Be very careful of this place if you have a seafood allergy.  There is no way they can verify that occasionally things get mixed up.  Especially when you have so many people prepping orders.\n\n6. This place is very good for kids.\n\nThat's about it.  For me, there are just too many other places in Vegas to get soup, salads, and sandwiches.

There were tons of options, so it's easy to find something everyone likes. I ended up with the HBC (honey bacon club) sandwich and summer chicken salad. The HBC was smaller than I thought but actually filling. It was a panini and came out super fast, warm, and was melty & cheesy. The salad was also yummy, refreshing, and a larger portion than I thought. It was hard finishing both items, but I got them down without feeling like I hated my life. \n\nI did notice there were tons of people behind the counter. Like, TONS. There was a person to hand my food to the other person to hand the food to the cashier.

Oh my...the whole car smelled like carne asada and rich, seasoned enchilada sauce.  (They serve their chimis enchilada-style).  \n\nWhile I was unpacking it, one nice little touch I noticed was that someone stuck a tortilla chip between the guac and the sour cream just to keep them apart for transport.  It may end up a rich gooey mess on my plate, but it's not going to start out that way.  That made the presentation very nice when I opened the container.\n\nThe carnitas taco was small, street taco style and had a very good flavor, but the meat was slightly dry.  I added a few chopped tomatoes and a little guac and it was perfect.  I would definitely get that again.  \n\nThe chimi was full of delicious carne asada.  They really know their stuff here.  The meat was good quality and so tender it melted in my mouth.  I had half for dinner and then the other half the next morning with an egg on top.  DEE-licious!  \n\nAnd the churro was a nice sweet way to end the meal.  My total before tip was $10.42.  I was very impressed with the attention to detail and the flavors.

Granted, it was Tuesday, the day after they aired on Diners , Dive In's and Dives (or so we were told).

I HATE bad business...It bugs the bajeezuz out of me. You (Mr owner) OBVIOUSLY KNOW when the show is airing.. how about preparing ahead of time.. hire a freaking Host for \"whatever\" an hour and splurge on a food runner... another server would be nice but heaven forbid..that 3.50 an hour plus tips might break you....maybe the economy isn't so bad and everyone in the Phoenix area IS employed and you can't find help. One more cook equals 3 would be good.  4 lonely hands not so bueno. The way I look at it... in the time it took to order, get served, and then the 3 minutes to eat they could have turned the tables twice with proper staff.. feeding trice as many people, MAYBE making people happy (but ya need better food for that) hence making you some more money... but hey.. that's just me. Stick to cheap ways, doesn't matter here in Phoenix... everyone gets away with mediocrity... no competition.  I don't care if the owner is nice and has swanky white glasses.. get real dude...

I'm not joking people.. this guy was the only guy with a sense of urgency.  Give him a raise.. if it wasn;t for him people would be waiting an extra 10 minutes on top thier already wrongfully delayed seating time.\n\nThe CF steak was  not bad but the gravy was less than average (clumpy and BLAND) therefore lessening the overall taste. \n\nThe pancakes tasted as if were made from a generic box mix with some extra ingredients chocolate chips added.  Nothing special..ANYONE can make the same at home.\n\nThe B&G.. well the biscuits were hard and oily.  The gravy.. again..

As far as restaurants are concerned, it's something that's very hard to screw up. Menu creation can't be all that difficult because of the classic meat + egg + potato + bread formula we've all come to expect. I'm not here to write to say Over Easy screwed up, but they were on the verge of coming close.\n\nI had been wanting to try Over Easy for about a  year now, partly because of all the media attention is has received locally as well as nationally. I'm always up for an alternative to the national chain pancake houses I grew up eating at. For this reason and the classic breakfast formula being so hackneyed and often trite, I am often inclined to avoid that part of the men, unless [the restaurateurs] try something a little different with it.  Over Easy showed promise with a little dish they call \"The Wolfpack\". \n\nUpon more objective observation, the dish is just a mild variation on an old classic with more starch, luring you into a false sense of hedonistic pleasure, but really just filling your belly with potato.\n\nBeing my first time here, and looking to enjoy a good hearty breakfast, I decided to play it relatively safe and ordered The Hopple Popple. Chunks of salami, potato, cheese and egg scrambled together with bell peppers for color and for texture and served with a side of toast. It's another variation on an old classic and probably not unlike something I'd make at home, so I decided to try it.  It's description reminded me of something I had ordered at Matt's Big Breakfast not too long ago, so why not.\n\nMy first thought as my server placed my plate in front of me was \"That's it?\" Presentation left something to be desired and even though the atmosphere had a somewhat kitschy greasy spoon vibe to it, I wasn't all that impressed. The amount of salami was substantial, but the chunks were so big, they appeared sparse in the monochromatic assembly of ingredients that lay before me. It may sound silly, but a small bit of parsley or a sprig of rosemary as garnish would have probably classed up the plate a little.\n\nMy wife tried the Chicken Fried Steak, an old classic I am always drawn to, especially at independents because it really gives them a chance to shine. Any old restaurant can take a flash frozen fritter and drop it in the deep fryer, but it really takes something to bread your own steak. For that I give Over Easy kudos. \n\nFor my daughter, the economic egg + potato + bread dish (add meat for $2 more) satisfied all nutritional requisites but was very basic in it's execution. The most interesting part of the whole meal was when the matriarch of the crew behind the counter shared with us their Tomato Jam, a salty sweet concoction that was equally good as a spread on toast as it was a dip for tater tots.  \n\nIn all, I wasn't all that impressed, but the menu showed promise and perhaps next time I'll be a little more adventurous in my selection as long is isn't just thrown on the plate because going out isn't all about the food, it's the experience as well.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "This place is ok.

The little place is quaint, but the enclosed patio simply needs more ventalation. I feel bad for the servers and wonder how much sweat they've dripped into food. \n\nSpeaking of the food, I would say it is perfectly acceptable breakfast food. I had an omelet on my first visit and tried the eggs with mushrooms this visit. I LOVE mushrooms. I can't keep myself from eating them raw when I'm supposed to be cooking them, and I wind up tasting them at all phases of the cooking process. This dish had tons of mushrooms - so many I couldn't find my eggs underneath them. It was just sort of an unattracive murky mess of mushrooms. I could probably have gotten over how it looked if the flavors were impressive, but the flavor was rather uninteresting. \n\nMy friend had the standard eggs-bacon-toast breakfast and felt very very okay about it. \n\nI've heard the restaurant is moving into a larger space so maybe I will give them another try when they're settled in to the new spot.

This is the type of breakfast dive (even featured on Diners, Drive-ins & Dives) that I'm usually in love with. I've heard such good things, but thanks to less than stellar food and underwhelming service, Over Easy feels like it's quality is under medium. \n\nWith a free Tuesday morning and a $20 for $10 gift certificate from Local Dines (http://www.localdines.com/?ref=19485), my girlfriend and I decided to skip the usual eggs and/or cereal breakfast, and give Over Easy a try. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered an omelet with chicken, peppers, mushrooms, and caramelized onions. First problem with the omelet; it wasn't an omelet. Omelets are supposed to be light, fluffy, and folded. This came out as just a big scramble. The next problem; they used raw onions instead of caramelized. She sent it back, and explained that she hates raw onions. When it came back, it was clearly obvious that the cook simply caramelized some onions and threw it in with the original omelet. So the raw onions she doesn't like were still in the alleged omelet. It also comes with potatoes on the side. The potatoes were pretty mushy, when they should have been crispy. She could've sent it back again, but what's the point? After just a couple bites, she gave up on it.\n\nShe also had an Over Easy Ice coffee. There was nothing special about this specialty coffee. Tasted like Folgers with cream and cinnamon. No taste from the cardamom and mint that was supposed to be in there. \n\nI had the Selina. It's a breakfast burrito. Not bad, but not anything special. Again, the potatoes (which are inside the burrito) are mushy, so there is no texture to it. And none of the ingredients taste fresh, so it seemed like something I could've microwaved up from Fresh and Easy. \n\nWe also had the 1/2 order of Caramelized banana & pecan brioche French toast. I was truly expecting something mind blowing, and it was anything but. While it kind of tasted like a bananas foster, it also tasted like it could've used another minute on the griddle. \n\nThey had no problem taking the omelet off the check, but it took forever to get that check. We were also kind of surprised that a manager never came by to see how everything was after we sent food back. I left stuffed, but disappointed; my girlfriend left unhappy and hungry.\n\nThe tables being right on top of each other don't really help. We could easily see and hear that the other couple sitting behind us was also having issues with the food and service. It also probably isn't a good thing that the people next to us could hear us talk about how disappointed we were. An open kitchen probably isn't the brightest idea, either. We could see quite a few obvious healthcode violations. \n\nWith the Local Dines certificate, our total came to about $5 dollars with tip.

We came right around 7:45am and were the 3rd table in the restaurant - a blessing because we wanted to make it to work on time after our fancy breakfast (anything compared to a homemade shake is fancy).  We seated ourselves and were assisted within a few minutes.  I would say both our orders came out within 15 mins - not too bad for what appeared to be very fresh, hot food.  \n\nI read the previous reviews and figured I would try something that was a \"typical\" breakfast choice for me: the Mediterranean omelet. I considered creating my own (I'm one of those slightly picky people about what I have in my omelets) but felt the short but mighty ingredients in this omelet would hit the spot - spinach, garlic, tomatoes, and feta. What's not to love? I skipped the variety of potato options in favor of an English muffin. Although I love me some potatoes, I'm really glad I did!  \n\nI love love love cold pressed coffee and was very interested in how they prepared their Over Easy Iced [coffee]; with cinnamon and cardamom, followed by sweetened condensed milk (the best thing ever to add to coffee) and a hint of mint. I could envision how the first three flavors would work together but didn't know how the mint would come in (and I'm not normally a mint person).  \n\nMy husband, a complete sucker for almost any configuration of eggs Benedict, settled on the Deli Eggs Benedict (I called it - the salami was calling his name).  He chose a half/half order of regular and sweet potato tots and eventually caved, at my insistence, for the iced coffee too.  \n\nI loved the homemade strawberry jam that came with my English muffin - not too sweet and a strong strawberry taste. Our server told us the jam they were using before were not up to par for them so they switched to making their own - works for me!  I polished off half my English muffin before I turned to my omelet.  Personally, I thought my omelet was fantastic and exactly what I was looking for. I was worried that it would be one of those three egg behemoths that is more appropriate for lazy Sunday mornings but thankfully it was normal-sized (they have three egg omelets though, if you are interested in a behemoth meal). I loved the combination of flavors, it wasn't runny inside (not something I mind but I know there are people out there that need their eggs cooked through), and I felt there was a good balance of all the ingredients, not too much or too little of anything.  I complemented my omelet with a few (okay, a puddle to the side) of Chohula hot sauce - you can never have enough of that stuff!  \n\nI ended up really liking the iced coffee - since it was cold pressed there isn't the normal bitter after taste that you can some times get with coffee. Instead the after taste was a marriage of cream and mint with just a hint of coffee. I thought the mint could potentially muck it up but I found myself really liking the after taste. I was worried about having major garlic and feta breath but the coffee (emotionally, I can't speak for real life) put my fears to rest because I was able to wash the tastes away and leave only the cream and mint.  It was less sweet than I expected, but then I didn't feel like I needed to either - and I normally put an obscene amount of sweetened condensed milk into my coffee or black tea. Overall, I was very satisfied with my meal. \n\nI'm not always a fan of eggs Benedict - the hollandaise sauce is usually too much for me in the morning. However my husband was quite happy with his meal - the eggs were perfectly poached and the man loves himself some extra sauce and it was plenty saucy for him.  He can't turn down anything with salami in it so it was just icing on the Benedict for him (har har). The amount of taters he received was epic - it took up at least half his plate!  I only sampled the sweet potato taters (How can you walk away from fried sweet potatoes?) and they were quite yummy. He assures me, however, that the regular tots were just as good if not better (he assures me he is okay but I'm not sure what's wrong with him - sweet potatoes are awesome).  \n\nWe had no issues with service through out our meal - we were checked on once or twice, which fine with us.  Check out was quick and we were done and out of there by 8:45 am, a miracle for us (I am a SLOW eater). \n\nBy the time we were finishing up quite a few tables had filled up, so if you want more of a quiet breakfast, we definitely recommend this to early risers.

What?!?! It isn't 10pm yet!!\n\nWe called Pita Pit and a very nice employee named Paul apologized for the glitch and said that was an issue that someone else had reported- the website cutting off orders before 10p. He took our order over the telephone and said that he would make sure we got our food and look into the website issue.\n\nOur order arrived shortly, and we were starving. My friend got the Chicken Slouvakki (sp), and I got the Chicken Crave. We also got an order of pita and hummus to share. The pita was just average. Barely warm and kind of tough. The worst for me was my Chicken Crave. It was FULL of onions- the first bite I took was ALL onion! I definitely didn't expect that. I ended up having to unwrap it and try to pick out some of the onions because they were so overwhelming.

Generally, the fare is boring and pretty straightforward. We would not normally have gone but the hubs had a coupon for $50 off $100 so we decided to give it a try.\n\nOf note, is the schizophrenic ambience of this restaurant. Set in an ultra contemporary setting with plump pillows and plush seating, it was a little shocking to see the wide variety of dress here - including a fellow dressed in a faded t-shirt, plaid swimtrunks and flipflops. At a place that serves $30 steaks, it was a little bit disconcerting.  While Alanis Morissette singing \"Jagged little pill\" blared in the background, I felt sorry for the one young couple dressed to the nines attempting to have a nice romantic dinner.  \n\nWe ordered the lobster bisque with puff pastry ($11) and caesar salad ($7) to start. The lobster bisque was decidedly one-note - flavoured strongly of lobster but little else. It's watery texture paired with the rather lackluster puff pastry make this a menu item to skip. The caesar salad on the other hand was a better rendition of a classic steakhouse staple. The dressing had a nice amount of acidity which lightened a regularly over-heavy salad. Unfortunately, the romaine was cut too small which marred the crispness of the lettuce.\n\nFor our proteins, we ordered the brick chicken ($19), bone-in New York($34),  and accompanied this with potatoes au gratin($7), mushrooms($7), green beans($6). \n\nI cannot speak highly enough about the brick chicken. They served a marvelous whole deboned Jidori chicken with a lovely crisp skin and perfectly moist meat on the inside. How they manage keeping it moist with very little bones, I have no idea. It is definitely a steal at $19. (FYI - it may, at first appear a little bland, however I believe it is served that way because you are supposed to dip the meat in the accompanying au jus). The bone-in New York was also good albeit not as outstanding as the brick chicken.\n\nTthe sides were our main beef (so to speak). Anemic button mushrooms (not a lovely toasted colour) were flavourless. The wonderfully fresh haricots verts (thinner longer variety of green beans) were rather bland considering it was swimming in some sort of garlic and butter concoction. The potatoes au gratin lacked a proper golden crisp crust and too heavy on the garlic.\n\nFinally dessert. Although it wasn't really bananas foster ($7) in a traditional sense, it was rather lovely. The banana was tempura fried and came with a nice rum sauce poured overtop and served with vanilla ice cream. The ripeness of the banana was perfect and crunchy coating make nice textural contrast.\n\nOverall, given the average steakhouse cuisine, this place does somethings better than most (ie, the brick chicken, bananas foster) while dismally failing in other departments (the sides and the starters).

Our waitress was very nice and very knowledgeable about the menu and food. The food was in very large portions, we shared the Prime Rib and french scalloped potatoes and garden greens. Dessert menu was simple and good, we had  a real  New York cheese cake and the Tiramisu. We enjoyed this restaurant immensely. The location is very convenient being local. My favorite thing about this particular restaurant was that we didn't have a time limit on our dining experience, we literally closed out the restaurant and they were very nice about that, didn't once asked us to leave because they were closing.

How about this; \"MRKT Sea & Land is a restaurant in search of an identity.\" I do not say this lightly, but this is really the case and it was quite apparent as the dining experience went alone.\n\nMy wife and I decided to step out to a \"Higher End\" restaurant for our 2nd anniversary. We had $25 restaurant.com discount (knowing this bill would probably be about $100) so we felt like we could order freely without worrying about price. So armed we sallied forth.\n\nWith the exception of \"being given the eye\" when we walked in the staff was on the whole polite and helpful. When things didn't quite work out they were very accommodating and understanding. The restaurant itself is well designed and inviting with a music track that is up-tempo without being too loud. The booths were not easy to get into and out of, but I call this a quirk. Lighting could have been a little more subdued to add to the \"higher end\" restaurant experience they were after, but again I call this a quirk of their choices. It did all add up to something I call \"AKC\" (more later) atmosphere, but it was easily handled.\n\nThis restaurant has all the trappings of wanting to be a marquee 5 star restaurant but just does not know how to do it, and it was all the little things that gave them away. For example, when refilling our Iced Tea the server poured the tea over the table towards us, a no-no in fine dining. The second time I lifted my glass and set it away from me so the server should get the hint, but still he left the glass on the table and refilled the tea. But then he made another mistake and lifted the glass next to the rim and set in down in front of me. Oops. (Would you like to drink from a rim of a glass where the server just touched? Didn't think so.) It was not until later that our server (who was also tending bar) refilled our drinks correctly by lifting the glass by the base, filling it away from the table and returning back by the base. These kind of details were all missing from the experience.\n\nSo let's talk about the food. My wife ordered the Prime Rib (16oz. cut), generous for the price of $25 and the Potatoes Au Gratin ($7 more). I order the Bone In Rib Eye (also 16oz.) for $38 and a simple Baked Potato (also $7 more). Obviously the ordering is all al-a-carte, something I personally do not like because I feel it is just a scam to up your bill. Also there ends up being so many plates on the table it interferes with the dining experience. \n\nWhen you are in a casino there are many kitchens, a dedicated kitchen for a specific restaurant and a more general kitchen for the hotel overall. Sometimes you can get crossover between kitchens and the taste can be reflected in the food. I think this was the case here. I feel like there was crossover because the recipes and preparation were so old school it left little to enjoy. Item by item: The Prime Rib was good but lacked any kind of real taste and had a huge piece of fat in the middle. (Yes, I know there is supposed to be an eye of fat, but this was at least 5oz.) So the Prime Rib was your standard buffet Prime Rib, a bit disappointing. The Potatoes Au Gratin were made with AMERICAN CHEESE AND THE POTATOES WERE INCIPIENTLY OVER COOKED. We sent it back and hope they get a better recipe for the future, not something from 1978. Now for the Rib Eye; I kinda asked for it I guess, I asked if the steak was aged or not. When the answer came back \"it was fresh\" I knew right there that there may be trouble. Indeed, as the steak cooled and I got to the center it became apparent this piece of meat had been frozen at some time. (If you are a steak lover you know what I mean as the texture of the steak become mealy. In fairness I do not know this to be fact, but in my opinion, and that is what matters here, it was frozen at some point.) For $38 I would hope for an aged steak, especially a Rib Eye that shines the longer it is aged. It was not 2 weeks ago that I had a 21 day aged Porter House and the flavor blew my head off it was so good, so I had something to compare it to. Are you seeing where I am heading here, this was fair food from a buffet, but NOT a restaurant looking to be something better.\n\nI say this with all the love from my heritage and totally tongue and cheek; \"AKC\" stands for Alter Kocker Certified. This is a restaurant that is primarily patronized by our senior citizens because the food is the same as it was in 1962 and generally does not challenge the diner. You know these establishments when you see them, and unfortunately MRKT is AKC in disguise; nothing challenging but nothing to make it noteworthy. The only thing outstanding when all is said and done is the price, and if they keep this cooking (not cuisine) they will not be around long.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 4, "useful": 5, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "Decor is absolutely beautiful!

We went to see Iron Man 3 at 4PM and planned on dinner afterwards. Since we were already at the casino we decided to eat at one of the restaurants there.

Have never been before and had not looked up any reviews so we were not swayed in our opinions.  Well, it was nice to get a good surprise after the last time we ate at a restaurant at the casino.  To start the service was excellent. We ordered drinks that you knew actually had alcohol in them. Seems that a lot of restaurants dont put much alcohol in their mixed drinks so you are paying for an expensive drink with very little alcohol. I ordered shrimp cocktail as an appetizer. Four huge shrimp with delicious sauce. My daughter ordered crab cakes which she said were the best she had ever had. I then ordered the salmon. The biggest piece of salmon I have ever had in a restaurant. Cooked to perfection. My daughter ordered prime rib that she could cut with her fork. We split mashed potatoes with garlic added. Perfect.

They go for a couple dollars not one million...just so you know. \n\nSo been here three times already. First time was for the private preview party they held and then again for lunch and dinner once they opened. All visits the CZ crew has been uber cheerful. Pretty uber staffed too. They are well prepared for crowds for sure. This location feels smaller compared to the other Henderson location, but seating wise, I like the wide booths. The condiment/drink/utensil area is hidden behind the wall divider from main dining area.  You can add flavored syrups to your fountain drinks or iced tea.\n \nI'm uber happy! I don't have drive those extra minutes now if I'm feeling I just want a salad and a chocolate covered strawberry.\n \nSo there you go.

The food was fresh and offered a lot of healthy options. They also have a wifi hotspot inside and a recharge station where you can sit, eat lunch and charge ur laptop/devices. Also, I liked the syrups they offer next to the soda machine so u can flavor ur drinks. They give chocolate covered strawberries with every order! Overall, I'm happy with this place and it is ABOUT TIME that we started getting better (by better i mean healthier) food options on this side of Henderson! Nothing but pizzerias and tons of fast food!! This place will do well especially in the hot summer months when a HOT meal just doesn't seem so appetizing! I got the turkey cranberry sandwich. I will be posting pictures of my order along with my fianc\u00e9's. I really like the turkey cranberry sandwich the honey mustard on the bottom was sweet and not to mustard-y Like some honey mustard's tend to be & I really liked the cranberry sauce on top with the sprouts. Also, I got the chicken chopped salad with blue cheese dressing. My only complaint was that I wish I had gotten the same type of lettuce that my fianc\u00e9 got on his salad instead of the iceberg lettuce they put with mine. There isn't much nutritional value in iceberg lettuce were as he got the deep romaine greens that I would've wanted. Although, I'm sure that if I had known that it came with that type of lettuce I could've asked for the kind that he got. I will make sure to do that next time. All in all this was a great experience and I highly recommend this place if you're looking for something that is not deep-fried or saturated in fat. Also, great tasting fresh ingredients!!

You'd better watch out! Caf\u00e9 Zupas has arrived.\n\nI was a huge fan of the first Vegas location on Eastern Ave. Now that they've opened much closer to home, I'm ready to forsake that original spot altogether. Caf\u00e9 Zupas delivers soups, salads, and sandwiches with fresh ingredients and in-house dressings with great service. They always have someone at the door, they always clear tables without taking tips, and they follow a carefully crafted script of questions that gets customers through the line efficiently while also upselling on things like desserts and drinks. The foods are not what you would call authentic, but they are delicious Americanized renditions.\n\nI always get the try 2 combo ($8.29), where you get to choose 2 of 3 items from whole sandwiches, half soups, and half salads. Regardless of the weather (read: summer heat), I almost always get a half soup with a sandwich. The soups that I've tried are all really good. The lobster bisque and the roasted red pepper and lobster may not have real lobster, but they're both delicious. This week, I've really grown to love the wild mushroom bisque and the tomato basil. This location seems to serve their bread almost cold, so dip it fully in the soup to warm it up.\n\nAs for sandwiches, I definitely steer toward the ciabatta bread sandwiches rather than the panini sandwiches. The honey cilantro carnitas sandwich, which is a relatively new item, is very impressive because of its glaze, the pork, and the avocado. BBQ pulled pork sandwich and Italian club sandwich are also long-time favorites, and turkey cranberry is a nice reminder of my favorite holiday. Cuban grilled pork is alright if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nFinally, even though they're not my preferred choice, the salads are pretty good options as well. Mangoberry salad, Thai mango chicken, and superfood delight are all salads that I've sampled here from friends or family.\n\nOops, almost forgot about dessert! Aside from the standard chocolate-covered strawberries, which are always great, they have many options for people with a sweet tooth. The creme brulee options are all nice, but my new favorite is a slice of chocolate heaven called the Sinful 7. It's rich, it's sweet, and it's chocolatey. I definitely need to share that with somebody next time because it's such a huge portion after a meal.\n\nOne thing I do miss from the Eastern Avenue location is that one or two of the regular employees definitely recognized me on my return visits, even as early as the second or the third time. Doesn't seem to be the case just yet on Sunset, but I'm so happy with the food and the location that we'll have plenty of time to warm up to each other.

Lunch is pretty reasonable for around the $7 range per person, but I think dinner is a bit pricey at about $9 a pop.  Damn the stinking economy even makes getting a salad harder to do.  But this place is considered vegetarian heaven.\n\nWhen you first walk in, you see trays to the left or right of you.  The place is kind of like a cafeteria in the sense that you take a tray, a plate, and concoct your own salad with the fixins'.  They have a TON of stuff to choose from like spinach, romaine lettuce, pickles, peppers, cheese, croutons, even my fav alfalfa sprouts, and lots of other fresh things.  They have a few special or house recipe salads at the beginning of the line.  My fav is the Won Ton Chicken Happiness salad, I get it every time and it usually fits the bill.   I do get a little greedy sometimes though and take as much of the chicken as I can find because as you can tell, meat is sparce in this place.  But you can buy a little container of extra chicken for $1.25.  To me it's not worth it.  I just go and jack extra chicken form the Chicken Noodle Soup and cut it up to throw on my salad...ha ha.  They also usually have a decent house Caesar salad and a special salad that changes monthly according to one of their themes.  After you go down the line you and choose what you want, you get to the end and pay for your drinks and meal.  Then you get seated, or if it's not busy you can seat yourself.  \n\nThey also have a soup area with at least 5 or 6 different soups daily, with staples like Chicken Noodle, and Chile Con Carne.  Their Cream of Mushroom soup is great (I think it's only on certain days..Tuesday?) because it's got lots of fresh mushroom in it.  You can also make yourself a baked potato with butter, sour cream, cheese, bacon, green onions, and onions.  Not to mention they also have a bakery section that features breads, muffins, pizza bread (great with their killer Ranch), garlic bread, and even gooey chocolate cake or cobbler (dinner only).  They also got a fresh fruit bar, build your own sundae bar, and a pasta station with 3 diffferent selections to choose from.\n\nThe food here is pretty fresh and not bad at all.  If you enjoy a salad and soup you will like this place.  I usually find myself craving for a steak or a rotisserie chicken however after I eat here.  For some reason, not having a hunk of protein on my plate leaves me hungry.  Good thing all their food is fresh, otherwise this probably wouldn't be a great place to eat.  I can eat at least 2 plates though of their Won Ton Chicken Happiness salad.  AND at least 6-8 pieces of their pizza bread (only from the MIDDLE part...ha ha) with Ranch.  They got good Strawberry Lemonade too. \n\nTheir sundae bar ain't too bad even though it's standard fare from a soft serve machine.  You can make one with vanilla or chocolate ice cream, Oreo crumbles, sprinkles, chocolate, caramel, pineapple, and cherries.  They have these little, itty, bitty baby cones to put ice cream in (I guess this is to cater to the little ones).  I ALWAYS, ALWAYS try to fill one of these little cones up and it overflows, causing ice cream on my hand.  Never fails.  Maybe they can install something to make the ice cream come out a little slower?  I don't know.  \n\nEat here if you're craving a salad (a lot of us don't), enjoy freshness (at a bit of a price), and are vegan or vegetarian.

In addition to the wide selection of salad ingredients, there's also every dressing imaginable to choose from.\n\nIf you don't wish to put together your own unique salad, you can instead grab your choice of an already prepared and labeled gourmet salad.  I recommend the Asian chicken salad mix with its crunchy won tons and zesty sweet dressing.\n\nThere are also hot \"bars,\" with do-it-yourself pasta and soup stations.  These items are controlled via hot water tanks and heating bulbs, so the freshness isn't always what it should be.  The noodles tend to be stuck together and using two tongs sometimes works best.

We don't usually buy drinks unless they're alcoholic, and I know from past experience that Sweet Tomatoes' coffee is the worst swill in the world.

One, a spinach with turkey, apples, and almonds, tasted really peculiar.  \n\nEvery month the theme changes except, apparently, December.  All the inspiration went out with Thanksgiving.  There was stuffing to put into a cream of turkey soup.  Many of the salads had turkey as an addition.  The soups were uninviting, too, unless you like cream soups:  there were two to choose from.  They had an Asian Ginger broth whose sign said to add spinach, mushrooms, scallions, and a host of other ingredients, but all of those were way on the other side, requiring a walk to the back of the restaurant to get around back to the front, where the salad item are.

It just means that I have an easy exit back to my car when I am done eating.  \n\nHaving not been to a Sweet Tomatoes or Souplantaion style restaurant in a very long time I did not remember that you start by grabbing a tray and plate and filling up with salad before you pay.  It was confusing to me at first.  So I just followed the lead of those in front of me.  The line moved a bit slowly but it gave me time to put what I wanted on my plate without feeling rushed.  I had Ceasar salad, spinach, mixed greens, olives, beats, shredded squash, feta cheese, sun flower seeds, cauliflower, cucumber, and mushrooms all topped with balsamic dressing.  When I got to the register I gave the cahsier the coupon I had for 20%.  She scanned it and I paid $11.19.\n\nI then sought out an open table where I could eat without feeling like I was taking up space as a single diner in a place that is set up more for groups.  I settled in an open area near the soda fountain.  Before I started on my salad I went up to the soup bar and filled a bowl with cream of mushroom soup.  It has a toss up between that and the creamy tomato basil.  I feel I made a wise choice.  The mushrooms I could tell were fresh.  Not canned.  Delicious.  I also grabbed a piece of sour dough bread and some creamy butter before heading back to my seat.  \n\nAs a speedy eater I did not feel like I was in the way at all.

There is not much expected in a buffet style restaurant but the service here was good.  The major issue I have is the price.  $10.29 plus the price of a drink and tax seems high for a salad bar.

You're able to customize to make your meal as healthy or unhealthy as you want- I really try to stay away from the premade versions as they general are over-dressed and have more caloric ingredients.\n\nOnce you are seated, you can then add on soup options. Tomato soup was delicious,  cream of mushroom was a super-fresh featured flavor, and the clam chowder was very flavorful. The black bean chili had surprising depth of flavor but didn't really suit me, nor did the chicken noodle chunk.\n\nThe baked potato bar, pasta options, and dessert area are very limited- which for us was a good thing, as we could not really be tempted and could focus on the healthy meals we came here for.

We did like the pea soup , which was one of the few items in the buffet that had any noticeable meat in it.\n\nThe rest of the buffet were a bunch of carbs....muffins, corn bread, pizza with a tiny bit of cheese on top, macaroni and cheese, pasta with acidic tomato sauce........Just what i consider cheap fillers with no real nutritional value.\n\nSoft ice cream was the basic desert...no fresh fruit offered except whole apples and a few unappetizing things such as jello.\n\nI would really not recommend this buffet to anyone other than vegetarians.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Nice salad bar.

Even though the line was long and it was loud in there, the cashier and the owner were all calm, cool, and friendly--very warm, in fact. Didn't get flustered.

My husband and daughter both enjoyed theirs, though, so I decided to go back and give them the constructive criticism.

I ordered a BLT sandwich and the steak fries. I also got a cupcake. I wanted a coffee to go with my cupcake but they don't serve coffee. Uhhhhhhhh Really? How do you have a selection of deserts but no coffee? I was told that they \"used to have it but no one wanted it so they got rid of it\". And here I was thinking that they just opened last week. Seems like it would take more than a week of being open to determine that your customers really don't want coffee with their desert. \nThe sandwich and the fries were good. Not to die for but good for lunch. The cupcake was a whole other issue. It was very very dry. I don't know how long it had been sitting in the case but it was so dry it crumbled everywhere as I took off the wrapper. This is the tough part- there is a place around the corner that is famous for their cupcakes. To compete with that your cupcakes just can't be dry.\nThe service was good but a little much. I was just trying to eat and read my book. I appreciate that they kept asking me every 5 minutes if everything was ok but it was a tad overboard. There is a thing as too much!! \nLastly, I think the people behind the counter need to be trained. I realize they just opened and its a bunch of teenager working but when you have ONE kind of cupcake in the case and you are asked what kind it is- the person should know. Then when they find out what kind it is- it should not be followed up with \"oh I don't even know what that ingredient is\". \nMy positives: The atmosphere is nice. I will say if you don't like sitting close to other people you don't know, then sit outside. Inside is just one big long table.  \nThe frosting on the cupcake was really good. It really is too bad the cake wasn't so great but the frosting was right on.\nI have high hopes for this place as it is really close to my house and I will try it again.

Let me explain...\n\nI had waited a while for this to open as I heard about it through a friend who was involved in their marketing stuff. When it did open and I ordered food from there within I think the first week of them opening.. the food was stellar. The bacon was excellent and piled very high on the chicken sandwich, the chicken breast could have been a little bigger imo but it didn't end up being an issue because of the amount of bacon. The chicken sandwich was great... better than the farm grill as it had more to it than just a chicken breast slapped on bread. The applewood bacon was plentiful as I had mentioned and it was delish.. made the sandwich. \n\nI've had the sliders too and those seem pretty good, I'll get those again soon.\nThe shoestring fries are really good too.\nThe chicken salad is really good... not a huge fan of walnuts in it... but it's not bad and compliments the rest of it well. \n\nDecor makes it a nice little place inside. Modern deco and a small upstairs loft to eat in that's pretty cool. It is however too small and congested for any type of business lunch.. had some friends not eat there for a company lunch as the 8 of them just couldn't fit and talk about work. \n\nIf you live hyper local they do delivery on bicycles... I'm just out of range but that's cool.\n\n======// The issues....\nFirst and foremost is the lack of consistency. When they first opened, bacon was piled high (as described on the menu) and subsequent orders have lacked said 'piled high'... to the point where the wife doesn't want to eat there anymore because she's felt jipped twice now on BLT's w/ only a couple strips per side of bacon... which... when the whole sandwich is about bacon... kinda sucks. And if she doesn't want to eat there then that drastically limits my ability to do so as well.\n\nOrdering on the phone.... sometimes they want a CC number, and sometimes they don't ask. Once the number was given over the phone and then they wanted it on pick up as they hadn't billed it and they lost the number... um... why aren't they running it when I give it to them?? I'd rather not have my info written down and 'lost'... so I've been saying I'll pay when I get there since but... that's concerning. \n\nThe only food thing I've had there I didn't like so far is the mac-n-cheese. It was not very cheesy and more like noodles with some crumbly stuff and a little tiny itsy bit of melted cheese in it... not creamy... just dry.. didn't even eat much more than a couple spoonfuls.\n\n======// Overview...\nI'll go back but not as easily as before... the wife doesn't want to but I'll probably order from time to time on my own.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 5, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "The place is small, very small, and when I went with my 2 kiddos and hubby it was busy.

This time, they only had 2 pieces of bacon on each half of the sandwich. The bread to bacon ratio was far to low... disappointing. On top of that, the fries were undercooked and soggy. Doubly disappointing. \n\nVisit #4- I ordered the sliders. However, after tasting my husband's Mac n Cheese during our last visit, I asked for the fries instead of the mac n cheese (the mac is dry, clumped together, and bland).

The Spot is a rare restaurant that offers both.  It is not super-duper fancy or anything but the food is SO worth it.  Plus, it is so hard to find a good restaurant that delivers out here in the suburbs, but these guys do!  \n\nIn fairness, I have only ordered delivery from this particular establishment so I cannot review the \"in dining\" experience.  \n\nDisclaimer:  I RARELY order a salad from a restaurant because they are all pretty much the same....lettuce...tomato...diet meat....blah blah blah.  I can whip that up at home.  If I go to a restaurant I want something TASTY.  I have not, nor will I likely EVER, order a salad from this, or any other, restaurant that has SO MANY other great options.\n\nAnyway, here is the review:\n\nThe Burger: GET DOUBLE MEAT!!! You won't regret it....extra bacon, extra burger...totally worth it.  Somehow, this place manages to cook the burger all the way through (no pink), yet keep it SUPER juicy.  Idk how they manage this but the result is AWESOME. The first time I thought it was some magical fluke...but then it kept happening.  I love it.\n\nMac N' Cheese: It is PERFECT.  It has become my new \"go to\" condiment, replacing ranch dressing or nacho cheese.  I put it on the burger AND on the fries.  You WILL NOT regret it.  It is even good cold.  My only complaint is that it doesn't come in a big enough size.  I want to buy a GALLON of it.\n\nPoutine: Fries with gravy AND cheese curds!? Who thinks of this!!!  Full disclosure....I can't tell if the gravy is homemade or from a mix but it is so good, I don't even care.  Put the Mac N' Cheese on this too and you have a SUPERFOOD!\n\nSliders: Small, juicy and served on a bun that is a little sweet.  VERY good....also served with fries.  Get the Southwest Sliders and PUT MAC N\" CHEESE ON THEM!!\n\nFries/Onion Strings: Run of the mill.  Basically both are a means to get the mac n' cheese inside my face. Fries have always been crispy when delivered which is pretty solid when it comes to delivery for french fries.\n\nOther stuff, wraps, omelets, etc: My girlfriend orders some of the healthy stuff sometimes and she always says it's good.  I don't know....probably will never try it unless they run out of burgers, mac n' cheese or poutine.  \n\nCustomer Service: True story: We had a very negative experience once with this restaurant (very late delivery, cold food).  I emailed the restaurant and got a response THAT DAY from the OWNER, who actually offered a decent explanation.  He was EXTREMELY apologetic and rectified the situation within the week.  Sometimes the best way to judge a place is how they deal with a negative experience or feedback.  This place nailed it. Every employee we have spoken with has been friendly and kind\n\nBOTTOM LINE: The food is OUTSTANDING. It is even good cold. They serve breakfast all day.  They deliver so I can enjoy this food IN MY UNDERWEAR.  If you are a man and you are taking a date (or ordering food from home for a date!), she should be able to find some salad or wrap to enjoy...they even have vegetarian options.  If you are a woman, you can take your man there because he can get a HUGE burger and slap mac n' cheese on it to make it a SUPER BURGER.\n\nEDIT: Just ordered from The Spot again....super hot and yummy and fast delivery (just under 30 mins!). It is worth noting that Girlfriend ordered the \"California Breakfast blah blah blah\"....to be honest, I stopped listening after she said the word \"California\" and the words \"egg whites\".  Anyway, it came hot and fancy looking (with sauce drizzled in a VERY fancy way on it) but had too much green on it for me to pay attention.  Clearly it was really good because she finished it, and she NEVER finishes any meal....she is all into fitness and health and stuff so evidently you can get healthy AND delicious food here too.  It should be noted that I did actually eat her hash-browns.  They were crispy (even delivered) and hot and they soaked up the cheese from my mac n' cheese and the grease from my burger.

But as I got halfway down the first island of stuff, the delight turned into trepidation. At the cashier, which is at the end of your first go-round, she said $11.98 and I looked at my plate. \"For this?\" I wanted to ask. Wisely, I did not, for that is when I saw the other side of the buffet. There were warming lights and an actual kitchen back there, so I figured that must be where the meat is. I paid, however still leery. \nI sat my salad down and hurried over to the hot stuff. Soups, alright. Breads with cheese on it, cool. Pastas, ok. Meats? No. Crap. \nSo I knew I'd be eating 'healthy'. I could use more of that. I didn't complain too much. \nAll the salad stuff was fresh. Whether it was good or not will depend upon your taste in salad stuff. They've got a variety toppings, so you probably will create something to your liking. They seemed to have all the bases covered with the dressings, too...and the low-fat honey mustard dressing doesn't taste too low-fat, so don't avoid it. There's also oils and vinaigrette in bottles. I will say that for a place that specializes in salads, it seemed that they could have had even more toppings to offer...no ham, no turkey, no avocado, no mozzarella, no blahblahblah... I honestly have seen more offerings at a Ruby Tuesday salad bar. \nAs for the specially prepared salads, most people will find something tasty. I had the Caesar salad, the pineapple coleslaw, tarragon tuna something, and some chicken and rice thing. The best was the Caesar, which was especially fresh and had garlic croutons. The pineapple coleslaw was as refreshing a dish as I think I've ever had. The tuna and the chicken/rice thing was just ok to me...but I still must point out how fresh it all was. \nThe soups were delicious. I tried the shrimp bisque and the Mexican soup (can't remember the name). The bisque was awesome as I had two bowls of it, creamy with a subtle flavor and plenty of shrimp. The Mexican soup was the meatiest thing there and had a great rustic taste. Neither soup was greasy or too heavy. \nThe pasta was unremarkable. I had the lemon pasta with capers...all you tasted was a tang of lemon and absolutely nothing else. The pasta was well cooked, but just left you with no taste. I didn't bother with the mac and cheese, as I don't eat that at restaurants. Then there was the broccoli and cheese stuff...had too much of a twang to it, too sharp. I put it over the pasta to try and make something happen, the result was tasting nothing but the twang plus the tang. Uh uh. \nOne of things I enjoyed the most was the asiago something something bread. It was nice and crusty, but soft somehow. And the taste was great...garlicy and the asiago cheesiness. Perfect with all the salad and even more so to sop up soup. There were other breads, but none looked as appetizing. I must say that they kept it nice and fresh, with at least 3 batches coming out while we were there. \nDidn't try the yogurt or any of the deserts...should've. Oh well. \nThere is also some darn good strawberry lemonade here. Its got real strawberries from the looks of it, because you can see the 'seeds' or whatever that stuff is in strawberries, all in the stuff. Either that or my glass was dirty... No, but it was great, and goes well with everything. \nSomething else I'd like to mention is the service. The special salads had all been depleted, someone notified the cashier, the cashier immediately notified whoever, and they came over right away and began making fresh salads...which shows that there isn't some big vat in the back with premade stuff in it. The line was backing up, but the people making the salads were busting their butts. It was nice to see. \nWill I go back? Probably not, just not my style of buffet, even though it really SHOULD replace my usual buffets. \nShould you go? If you like salads a lot, and if you like soups a lot - then yes. Keep in mind that they only had 3 soups to choose from, and also some chili (didn't try). So that might not be enough variety for you. And you only get the pretty basic salad toppings. But its all fresh. Do not go here for the pasta. And I don't know what changes at dinner time, so maybe there's more variety then. \nGood value? Yes, if you can get full off of salad and soup. Looking for a meal with more girth? No. $12 for no meat for a man who is looking for meat leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Don't know the prices for kids under whatever age, but there is a senior price. \nIf you're smart enough to eat healthier, this is a decent place, but still doesn't seem to have enough stuff to choose from - that's my biggest gripe.

To their credit, everything looked and tasted fresh. The prepared salads were good, I'm pretty sure very high in calories as well. I had the potato leek soup, which was nothing to write home about. But.... this month they have chicken pot pie stew, you pour this on top of a biscuit and that was sooooo gooood. I'm surprised I liked it since I don't even like chicken pot pie, but the stew was nicely seasoned, the veggies were good and the biscuits were light and fluffy.

Good, quality breakfast is hard to come by in the South Mountain area, so we figured starting there in the Farm trifecta would make the most sense (and be the most rewarding).

The server directed us to the beverage station, where we had some slightly-watery lemonade and some *really* good coffee. It was rich and flavorful without being acidic. \n\nOur food came very promptly (do note, however, that we came on a weekday morning - I imagine the wait is longer on weekends and holidays) - my husband had the chicken enchiladas topped with eggs, and I had the Monte Cristo. We both agreed that the enchiladas were delicious - the chicken was really savory, the sauce tasted very authentic, and the eggs were the perfect complement - but the real standout was the Monte Cristo (ham and swiss cheese between two slice of French toast). The ham was crispy, the cheese tasted so fresh and light, and the bread was thick and as homemade as you can get. The maple syrup also tasted high-quality.

Right. So, it's a good idea that they close for the summer. But I digress. \n\nI have three reasons for my update: \n\n1. The Monte Cristo sandwich was still delicious (those farm-fresh eggs and cheese are so good!), but the bread that was so crispy and artisan last time was soggy and too syrupy this time. Note to chefs: the bread is what makes the sandwich complete, so get it right. \n2. The chicken fried steak (served with creamy gravy and rosemary potatoes and topped with one of their delicious, farm-raised eggs) was ridiculously good. The batter was light and crispy and the gravy was the perfect creamy and pepper complement. Try it. You won't regret it. \n3. When the server offers you a muffin or pastry after taking your order, don't accept unless you want to pay $2.50 for it. We fell for that trick and ended up paying for an orange muffin that was ok but kind of filled us up before we got to the good stuff. \n\nDefinitely still amazing, and definitely still worth checking out.

This one surprised me because on my first visit to Morning Glory  the OJ was freshly made and natural.  This is a serious pet peeve I have with breakfast places - all too often at other places, servers nod and smile when you ask if the orange juice is freshly squeezed, only to bring you the usual packaged stuff one finds at the supermarket fridge.  It isn't that hard - were the oranges physically squeezed in the back or not?  For a place like Morning Glory that prides itself on organic ingredients, fresh produce, etc, there is no excuse to be serving this kind of OJ.  It's pathetic, and anyone can easily  discern the difference.  If I wanted this kind of juice, I would've gone to a corporate breakfast diner chain like Denny's or Ihop.  Come on.\n\n2.  No pancakes on the menu, which was aparently tinkered with.   I'm pretty certain I had eaten pancakes here before....with them being such a fundamental breakfast classic, I can't figure out the warped reasoning behind not having them on the menu now.\n\nForget the pancakes....it's not a choice I would have made, but fine.  The orange juice issue, however, tells me their standards are beginning to slip, so I'd be careful if I was the manager.

The organic farm, rose garden, picnic tables, shade trees, and the whole ambiance of the farm was wonderful. It was almost like we weren't in Arizona anymore. \n       As we approached the hostess she was clearly not the most patient of people. She stated that she was not going to wait long for people to come up to claim their table when she called their name. You practically had to run up there in order to get seated at your table, otherwise she swiftly moved down the list to the next name. I think allowing people a good 60 seconds to make it up to the hostess to claim their table sounds reasonable, don't you? To be fair, it was 12:30pm and I think they close at 1, but still...  She directed us to our table where we sat ourselves to view the menu. The server came over and promptly informed us that they were out of french toast, the Monte Cristo, and that you could not order bacon or sausage on the side. The only way you could get bacon or sausage is if you ordered an item on the menu that included it. Apparently they were almost out of that too! A bit ridiculous if you ask me. I ended up ordering the Blueberry Waffles which were absolutely phenomenal. The whipped cream on top was the best whipped cream I have ever tasted. My dining companion ordered the American Breakfast and asked for the eggs on the side, on an additional plate because he is allergic to eggs. Of course, the plate ended up coming out with the eggs on the plate with the rest of his food. Food allergies should be taken seriously. Obviously, the allergy note got lost somewhere along the line. I ended up eating his eggs, which were really great as well. I also tried the breakfast potatoes that came with his breakfast and found them well seasoned and very tasty. \n      My dining companion will not be returning to this restaurant.

With days jammed packed this short trip would actually prove to be a little tricky in planning but after getting a general feel for the local logistics the restaurants fell into place nicely with breakfast, lunch, and dinner planned strategically each day along with a few snacks.  Beginning first with breakfast, just as my trip did, there were three proper sit down breakfasts in The Valley and the first took place less than an hour after I hopped of the plane at The Farm at South Mountain.\n\nWith bags packed light and my car easily obtained the drive to Morning Glory Caf\u00e9 would be a straight forward 15 minutes from Sky Harbor Airport and arriving at the large farm I proceeded down the gravel path through gardens of streaming sunlight that I quite simply did not expect to see in the \"desert.\"  With signs delineating the location of the caf\u00e9 (and the oft raved Quiescence next door) parking was found under a shady tree and checking the thermostat, 87 degrees Fahrenheit at 8:45am) I hopped out of the car and walked down the path to the restaurant only to find the patio approximately 1/3 full.  Greeted promptly by a thin young woman and subsequently by the elderly gentleman who would be my server I was told to \"sit anywhere you like.\"\n\nSelecting a seat in the shade as my pale Midwestern complexion certainly was not ready for an hour in the Arizona sun it would be mere moments before Cliff would stop by with the menu and a bucket of condiments to inform me of the daily pastry special and to ask if I had any questions.  Requesting a coffee I was informed that the coffee, water, and tea are all \"help yourself\" and suggesting I'd need a minute to browse the menu I was told to take my time.  \n\nWith the menu concise but full of excellent choices largely consisting of locally sourced meats and organic produce I spent a few moments weighing my decision and with my choices made I motioned to Cliff who stopped by to take my order and warn me \"you'd better be hungry\" before departing for the kitchen.  Undeterred by his warning I next proceeded to the coffee stand where biodegradable cups and lids were provided for both water and coffee and after getting a cup of each I returned to my seat where I sipped the thin and mildly acidic locally roasted Caf\u00e9 Cortez coffee while awaiting my appetizer.\n\nPrebaked but still warm, the first item to arrive at my table would be the pastry of the day - a Blueberry Muffin nearly the size of my fist and bespeckled with crystals of cane sugar.  First tasting the muffin as it was and then gilding the proverbial lily with salted California Dairies butter the muffin would prove to be quite impressive in its density but also in its fluffiness as the medium-size blueberries burst with flavor within the buttermilk batter with tinges of cinnamon tickling the palate.\n\nWith coffee refilled and a short wait as the patio filled another pair of tables with locals (and regulars judging by the greeting) Cliff would arrive perhaps twenty minutes after I was seated with the main course - the \"Farm Monte Cristo\" consisting of two thick slices of fluffy rustic French Toast sandwiched around slow baked local ham, two over easy eggs, and melting cheddar cheese.  Apparently expecting me to be overwhelmed by the size Cliff offered me a \"good luck and bon appetite\" before stepping away and with that I set out to douse the amalgam with warm organic maple syrup and take a bite; a bite that more or less redefined the Monte Cristo for all time as the bread was not the least bit oily but rather light and fluffy with a nearly croissant textured interior and slight yeasty notes mellowed by the syrup and the powdered sugar. Moving next to the ham-young, fresh, lean, and salty - and then the sharp cheddar and creamy eggs the flavor was in a word \"perfect;\" salty, sweet, creamy, crunchy, and at the same time surprisingly light.  It was not only the best breakfast item I had in Phoenix, but the best sandwich I've had in a very long time.\n\nWith Cliff returning surprised that I'd finished the meal and offering me a \"good job\" I joked (well, not really joked as I really did go for pastry and pizza afterward) that the sandwich \"wasn't that big, but it was THAT good\" and thanking him for the service I requested the tab while getting yet another coffee to enjoy while I checked my mail and another cup to go.  Noting now that the experience of such a great sandwich, setting, and service is not \"cheap\" ($23 with tax and tip) I can say without a doubt that if I do end up in Phoenix long term Cliff will not make the mistake of underestimating my capacity again because without a doubt I'll be a regular.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 3, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "Went to Morning Glory Cafe at the Farm on Sunday, 10/9.

That alone is a reason to stop by, but as food goes, I might just bring a picnic lunch or get lunch at the grill when I come back next time.\n\nI found the food to be mediocre at best.  I had the breakfast tacos, which were served in a hard shell - I didn't know restaurants served those anymore, especially on a breakfast taco.  The taste was fresh, minus the shell, but nothing special that I couldn't make myself at home.  The potatoes on the side had good flavor, but I would have preferred them to be crispier... they were rather soft.  The Hubs had the french toast, which he seemed to love.  I really saw him enjoying the candied pecans on top.

The new version was horribly disappointing with Marscapone Cheese and Raisin Bourbon Syrup. Both my wife, myself, and friends would have preferred the old candied pecan.\n\n3. Disappointing food:\n  - The \"home fries\" were dry, cold, stale, and very chewy with no seasoning at all. \n  - Biscuits and gravy were disappointing. Gravy had poor flavor and the biscuits were flat, and burned\n  - Eggs were very rubbery - I had to cut them with a knife.\n\n4. Some items are way overpriced. $2.50 for 1 egg??. I can but a dozen of the Hickman's eggs that are used at the grocery store for that price. \n\nThe one highlight of our visit was the Farm Monte Cristo. It was very flavorful and the Peppered Bacon Syrup was delicious.

Wake up sleepy head and let's go to the Farm at South Mountain for some Morning Glory, ie good breakfast.  \n\nMorning Glory is one of 3 restaurants on the Farm at South Mountain.  As you may have guessed, this is the restaurant that serves breakfast.  I bring all my out of town guests here that like to get up and have a nice breakfast.  The atmosphere can't be beat.  All the seating is outdoor/patio seating.  When you are sitting back there, you completely forget that you are sitting in a farm in the middle of Phoenix!\n\nI usually order lite breakfast items like a couple eggs and a toast, but I've tried the French bread there and I enjoyed it.  My friends have all enjoyed their meals as well.  I also enjoy their coffee.  \n\nFor the novice, you will find Morning Glory all the way at the end of the drive onto the Farm.  I would recommend parking in the spaces at the end of the drive instead of using the parking lot just east of 32nd St.  You can take a walking tour around the section of the organic farm adjacent to Morning Glory.  There's a chicken coop right there and you can see some of the produce.  The green house to the east of the chicken coop.  And you might find that the artist's studio is open that day, it would be west of the chicken coop.\n\nThe patio seating is friendly to dogs, but don't take your dog beyond the perimeter of the restaurants.  Maya's farm is an organic farm and you can't take dogs in the area where the plants are growing!  Watch out for the signs that warn you if you bring your pooch to b'fast with you.\n\nMorning Glory is a solid option for breakfast.  I especially like to invite visitors there for breakfast.

We just took the small table. It took around 10-15 minutes for a server to approach us, though she was quite nice. We placed our order and waited for quite a while.\n\nThe food was just OK. It was nice and fresh, but lacking much taste or creativity. The eggs, potatoes, and sausage were cooked without any seasoning. Take some fresh local ingredients and dump them on a flattop until cooked.... OK, they won't taste too bad because they're fresh, but they won't taste great either. I ordered the Cowboy Breakfast--two eggs over easy with chili. Very, very bland, and the beans were not cooked enough. I had to dump a sea of hot sauce on my plate to even taste anything.\n\nThey are also a bit tricky with their drinks. When they seat you, they will tell you to help yourself to a drink station that features lemonade, iced tea, and and coffee in huge decanters. They don't explicitly say you are being charged for these drinks, but when the check comes, you'll discover that the server has tallied up every cup at your table and charged you $3.50 each.

It is a bit out of the way next to South Mountain, but the rural farmy setting definitely benefits from that. \n\nYou enter by going up a long farm lane, passing between several buildings, an event lawn, a group doing yoga on the other lawn, etc. It is very picturesque and seems like a good place for a wedding or other party. There are several buildings at the end of the lane and Morning Glory Cafe occupies the patio of one of those buildings - you duck beneath a vine-covered arbor and enter the seating area. The tables are patio tables covered with plastic red gingham patterned tablecloths with menus scattered on them. You choose your own table and are advised to help yourself to coffee, iced tea, lemonade, water at the station next to the house. You can also order a few other beverages from your server - orange juice, mimosas, bloody marys, etc. \n\nThe menu is relatively brief but chock full of farm fresh ingredients. They have some interesting items - The Cowboy Breakfast Chili and Eggs, The Farm Monte Cristo, and the Chicken Enchiladas were all pretty unique breakfast fare and so we ordered one of each :) Browsing the menu, I learned that if you are a pancake/waffle/french toast/pastry lover, this is not the place for you. The food came out REALLY fast, which makes me think that they have most of the stuff ready to go in the kitchen and just garnish/sauce the dishes before sending them out. Itwas pretty good - I got the Chicken Enchiladas, which were filled with shredded chicken, covered with green chile sauce, and topped with Over Easy eggs. The temperature of the dish was less than great (a bit cold) and the yolks of my eggs were overdone, cooked all the way through. When I've had dishes like this before, the intention is that the yolks are runny and add moisture and flavor to the dish beneath. Since the eggs were overcooked, this didn't happen and it left the rest of the dish pretty dry (most of the green chile sauce was soaked into the enchiladas beneath) I did ask for extra chile sauce which was provided promptly, however it was very cold and did not spread well over the dish (I also could have still used even more of it, as the dish was SO dry) \n\nWe had a side of bacon that was delicious, and my husband enjoyed the Cowboy Breakfast Chili. \n\nThe setting was nice - we could hear roosters crowing and watch the activities of the farm/preparation for the day's events, etc. while we ate.\n\nService was decent - the girl who was our server was nice but a little brief - I was having trouble deciding and asked her for her favorite item on the menu. She said the Chicken Enchiladas but didn't really elaborate further, which didn't sell me on it. Her demeanor just came across as pretty uninterested.\n\nI felt like the prices were quite high considering the type of place (outdoor picnic tables), service (serve yourself for the key stuff and overall a little less than friendly) and food (seemingly mass made, okay tasting, not quite right) We spent $60 for three people and I walked away just really feeling as though it wasn't worth $20 per person.\n\nI did want to like Morning Glory Cafe, but in the end it was more of a \"meh\" meal.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 3, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "My husband and I took his parents here for brunch on a Saturday morning.

It is a peaceful oasis in the midst of a bustling metropolis.\n\nOne note to save you some walking - as we approached the are on 32nd Street, there was a sign pointing right that said \"Morning Glory Caf\u00e9\" and a sign pointing left that said \"Parking.\"  We turned left, parked, and walked down the long drive to the restaurant...where we found parking available for the restaurant.  Don't get tricked by the parking sign and park in the little lot across the street.  You can go down the drive and park closer to the restaurant itself.\n\nThe restaurant was fine overall; nothing terrible to talk about, but nothing amazing to talk about either.   The restaurant is outdoor seating only; there is no interior dining room so if you don't like to sit outside this probably isn't the best place for you.

The farm is awesome and it was a perfect day. We came here for a baby shower/brunch and were able to sit in the back on the grass. Everyone was excited we got some sun and were able to sit outside in February with such great weather. \n\nWe recognized the restaurant was busy, and no one was in a rush, but it seemed like our waitress couldn't handle the stress of brunch as well as having a larger party. I know I can be pretty harsh when it comes to serving, but when you spend over 10 years doing it yourself, you know how things could and should be done.\n\nWe had the menu in front of us for not even a minute and she was asking what we wanted to order. No drink order...no introduction...nothing. I had to prompt her that we were good to order drinks first -it being brunch and all we mostly opted for bloody's and mimosas. The bloody was good and refreshing. Not my favorite that I have had around, but not bad. Mimosas were good sized and had freshly squeezed OJ. \n\nWhen we finally did decide to order, we kept it pretty basic. The menu isn't extensive so that's easy. We all had a variety of things including the American breakfast which was nice and simple with a great little biscuit. Someone had the biscuits and gravy as well as the hash and others had the waffles and other stuff. Generally, for taste, everything was good, but it was cold on our half of the table. Having waited a bit, we all just kind of ate and commented that although it was good cold, it would have been awesome hot. The people who had hot plates had nothing to complain about. \n\nGetting the food was another story though -that took quite a while which made it annoying that some plates were cold and others were hot. If you knew you had to bring it out as it came, then I would rather one person have a hot meal and me have to wait for my hot meal as well. \n\nNow this is where I am a bit more sympathetic: having to split a bill. Some tables can be really annoying and make it a tedious task. Generally POS systems make it fairly easy to split things off of the main bill (if they did 10 years ago, then there's no reason it shouldn't be even better these days!). We asked to have our bill split because she didn't do it from the start. Someone even asked her to make sure she did it from the beginning so we could avoid this at the end. She went around and wrote down what each person or couple had and it took FOREVER to get the bills back. No worries for the most part as we enjoyed being outside but still. Once we got them, they still weren't split correctly! At this point we each just paid whatever piece of paper we had in our hands. Luckily gratuity was already added-but it was 20% right off the bat (FYI).\n\nThe silver lining, I guess, was that our waitress also over ordered for our table so we got a free farm omlet which was yummy and a free mimosa. \n\nI was SO excited about this place so I know I need to go back and try it again.

The grounds are beautiful and while I've eaten at all three of the restaurants at the Farm I love the Morning Glory Cafe most of all because I can sit in the grass nearby while I wait for a table to become available (yes, there will be a wait, especially on weekends) and I feel like I'm not in the dusty Arizona desert anymore. \n\nI've also come to MGC for Mother's Day for two of the past three years and it's almost become a tradition for me and my daughter. However, this last Mother's Day really (really) disappointed me. \n\nWhen I arrived we were told there was an hour wait. OK... No problem. I was expecting that (at least) and any other decent place would have a similar wait on Mother's Day. However, the issue was bigger than just the hour wait - the hostess who was calling people's names off the waiting list had such a faint voice that I couldn't hear her call my name - even though we were sitting right in front of her and I had gone up to ask her 10minutes prior if our table was ready. (You would think she would recognize me if I had just gone to talk to her and was sitting right in front of her but she seemed either clueless or overwhelmed).  As a result - we were passed up and FOUR other tables were seated before us. After figuring out we had been passed up I went back again and asked if our table was ready and the hostess didn't even apologize. I'm sorry but when you have over 50 people waiting at a time for their table, you can't put someone with the voice of a 9 year old in charge of calling names. I understand it's a farm and a loudspeaker would kill the ambiance but at least get a better system in place for making sure people get seated after they've waited so long for a table. \n\nFinally we were seated, and drinks were self serve so we immediately got water/coffee. The wait staff was completely frazzled at this point in the morning. They were stopping at tables for no longer than 2min at a time and making beelines between tables and the kitchen so you couldn't even get their attention without causing a scene. \n\nWe ordered a good 15min after being seated even though we knew exactly what we wanted to order. An HOUR later we still didn't have our food and my 5 year old daughter (who normally has to be bribed to eat) started crying. I asked her what was the matter and she said \"I'm so hungry!\" Not exactly the kind of thing a mom wants to be dealing with on Mother's Day. It was so sad the table next to us started offering us food off of their plates to give to my daughter (how embarrassing).  The waitress walked by a few times and I said \"Is our food almost ready? We've been waiting over an hour.\" Her response was \"Yeah, so has everyone else\" and walked away. \n\nFinally I called our waitress back and I said \"We ordered a cup of fruit. Can you at least bring that? My daughter needs to eat something.\" She came back with the fruit cup which my daughter inhaled and about 15min later we had our actual breakfasts (which were very good and well-made as always. Food never disappoints here).  I will say, that to \"make up\" for the wait, they gave us a complimentary dessert which was a nice gesture in the end but the whole experience has made me question whether I will go back for any special occasions. \n\nReason being - I've noticed the Farm grow in popularity over the years but there hasn't been any real improvements to their service. They still run the place as though they are getting the same amount of traffic as 5 years ago and that is obviously not the case anymore. \n\nThey could have done a better of job of getting us seated at the right time - or of getting a snack for my daughter if they knew the main breakfast was going to take longer than normal - or of telling us when we put our name on the list: \"it's an hour wait for a table and another hour wait for food to be served\" - so we could make a better decision as to whether we should stick around. \n\nThey need to find a way to keep it low key and quaint without putting people through the kind of experience we went through. Maybe a reservation system is needed for breakfast? Limit the number of guests? Idk, but they certainly shouldn't just leave people to wait over 2.5 hours to have their first meal of the day - especially when the majority of patrons in the mornings are families with young kids. \n\nAgain, isolated incident, but can't say that their seating system or wait staff are any more organized on other days of the year. Wait times for a table can be up to 30-45min on any weekend but normally food does NOT take over an hour to arrive. \n\nNote: they have a separate Mother's Day brunch that you can purchase advance tickets for, and those have scheduled seating times.

I eat at the \"regular\" restaurant nearby at least once per week and have done so since the place opened about 14 years ago. As for Sweet Tomatoes Express (STe), the parent company has been looking for new ways to make money (over their \"tried-and-true\" unlimited cold salad, soup and pasta buffets) for some time. While I was happy with the cleanliness of the facility and quality of the food served, the value of the meal for the price paid was considerably less than that of Sweet Tomatoes regular restaurants. Most everything is served \"a la carte\" -- choose a salad and pick your ingredients. Get a nice-sized portion and a free garlic bun or two. Buy a drink. Want some soup? That's extra, as are proteins or \"premium ingredients\". Want free soft-serve or dessert? Go to the restaurant because STe doesn't offer them. Want seconds? Order another salad, soup, etc. at full price. (By the way, the food photos shown on this page are a lie as they are for the restaurant and not STe.)\n\nI feel badly for Mike and his staff -- they were stellar!\n\nIn my humble opinion, STe did not offer a terrific business model especially for the Henderson folks who visited. Not only were the prices too high for the value offered but they refused to honor Sweet Tomatoes coupons or Club Veg specials. As I understand it, this location was first to open. To Souplantation corporate management: \"Hey guys, you're a restaurant that serves salads buffet-style.

Hummus, two stuffed grape leaves, wheat pita bread, spinach pie, tabbouleh, and falafel--great goodness me!  It was definitely a combo.

My favorite overall item is probably just the gyro rice bowl.   It's basically a bowl of rice with several pieces of gyro meat and a small side of israeli salad (which always consists of seemingly fresh tomatoes and cucumbers) and some pita bread (white or wheat).   I think the portion size is perfect with the rice bowls as opposed to the plates which should only be used for feeding large families.   Okay that's a lie as I still from time to time will order a plate because really the food is so good I always want more even when I finish.   That's probably a medical disorder that I just admitted to you all, but I like these reviews to have that extra special personal touch to them.    The plates are a little more expensive, and are loaded with more meat, more rice, more everything essentially and some hummus to boot!   I can highly recommend the gyro plate, and also tried one of the mixed skewer plates with chicken and lamb, and everything was great.   On occasion I also will just get a straight up gyro or the \"cheese gyro\" which is the same but with feta.   Stephano's makes an excellent version of this classic.  The gyro meat, obviously the driving force, is always tender, juicy, and full of flavor.  They don't skimp on the meat either.  I usually get an order of feta fries with those, and don't be fooled by the order sizes of \"small\" or \"large\".    The small is large and the large is unconscionable.  Even if you're sharing with another, the small will do.   \n\nThe only item I've ordered that I wasn't a huge fan of was the chicken shawerma wrap.

Overall, I'd say this review is maybe a 3.5 stars.  I can't go up to 4, but it certainly is better than 3.  Solid fries (thin and crispy), and good sauce.\n\nMy main issue that prevents me from bumping Stephano's up to 4 stars is the grilling of the gyro meat.  Not every place does this, and in some bites, it's FANTASTIC.  I love that flame kissed taste.  But, in a lot of places, really more often that not, it was overly cooked on the grill.  This results in a black and \"charcoaly\" taste and mouth feel.  It was these bites that I did not care for, and each time I had a lot of these bites.  \n\nThe fry sauce has a nice tang to it, it's not just ketchup and mayo mixed.  It's probably the best fry sauce I've had.  I also like the special during lunch wherein they give you a free drink if you order a sandwich and side.  I've taken advantage of this both times I ate at Stephano's.  \n\nThe check in offer is a small piece of baklava, which was fantastic.  It was the perfect size to finish the meal, and was very moist and sweet.  It was a great representation of baklava.\n\nOverall, I understand why this place is so popular.

I've been to some really good delis in New York (and even around Las Vegas) and it's hard to really compete. I wasn't expecting much, but still, this place just seems like one of those compromises you make because you're really hungry at lunch and don't feel like arguing with your co-workers. My first trip there I ordered a pot roast sandwich and received some sort of pastrami monstrosity that I had to dissect like a pig fetus before I could fit it reasonably in my mouth. The pastrami was gristly, dry and salty and I was kind of turned off. \n\nThe next time I went there I got some kind of California croissant with avocado and turkey that wasn't bad. But it's kind of expensive - like $8 - $10 bucks a sandwich. I could go to a lot of better places for that kind of money. After a soda it's like 12 or 13 bucks. \n\nNow when I go I just get the chili, which is pretty good all around. I've never been disappointed with the chili. The ambiance is loud. There are usually tons of people there at lunch (many with kids running around and screaming their heads off - like a Little Rascals episode) and usually some sort of supervisor woman yelling \"Service!\" or something to her servers every time an order needs to go out which adds to a kind of 1930s Soviet sweatshop vibe.

Overall, the service was lacking, what I purchased was overpriced, but the food was good enough to make up for the two other areas and I will definitely return. \n\nThe flow of how and where they expect you to order is just confusing. You have to walk through a row of tables or walk against the flow of customers ordering to get to the spot where they want you to order. Once you get there, there is an awkward pillar right in front of the main menu. I found myself hovering to each side of the pillar looking at different parts of the menu. On top of all that, the sandwich makers stare you down until you start to order. I felt pressured to decide what I wanted immediately. I had very little time to ponder over my decision. Once you order, the flow of what to do next is uncertain for new customers. I walked across the counter to the register only to find out that the sandwich maker would hand me my sandwich back where I originally ordered. Then, I committed the sin of asking for baked chips and I was forced to walk across the store to pick those up. Oh and FYI they charge 69 cents extra for any chips that aren't original Lays. Once I got to the register the cashier did not offer me a small size drink. She showed me the medium and said, \"this size is okay right?\" I found that to be a little sketchy. Finally she was ready to ring up my order when another employee came up and started talking to the cashier about her schedule. The cashier didn't even say anything to me, stopped helping me, and talked to the other employee for about a minute. Eventually my order was rung up and I was able to sit down and eat.\n\nBefore I review the food itself, I want to briefly talk about the value of the food. I paid for both my girlfriend's and my meals. We each got a full sized sandwich, medium drink, and a side. The order totaled around $18. I feel that Heidi's is asking a little too much money for what you get. To be fair, they do offer a $5 special that includes a half sandwich, side, small drink, and a cookie. I wish there were other ways to upgrade to a meal without downgrading my drink, sandwich and being required to have a cookie. So basically if you want to buy into the only real good value in the store, you have to compromise in what you are getting. \n\nFlow, service, and value aside, the food was amazing. I ordered the Fresh Mozzarella Sandwich on (thick cut) wheat bread. The sandwich included mozzarella, tomato, balsamic vinegar, lettuce, onion, and a mouth watering pesto sauce. The sandwich reminded me of how some people act with crack, I just couldn't get enough. Even after I left the store, I kept wanting to go back and get another one. My girlfriend got the Chicken Salad Sandwich on wheat bread.  Her's was equally delicious. I can't wait to go back and try something new.\n\nI gave Heidi's 4 stars despite the negatives I described in this review. I was really judging them during the ordering process, but once I sat down and bit in to my sandwich I was hooked. I believe if a restaurant has some flaws, the food can sometimes keep you coming back.

If I have to be entirely objective, I'd give it two and a half stars. Since Yelp doesn't offer half-star increments, I'm reluctantly giving Cafe Zupas three stars.\n\nWhy do so many of my friends love this place? I don't know. Could it be because many of them went to school in Utah, where Zupas originates, and the restaurant reminds them of their college glory days? If so, I get that. I, however, did not partake in their college experience so I'm not privy to the nostalgia they must feel when they are greeted by the harsh blue neon that is Cafe Zupas' decor.\n\nThe food, while good, is unimpressive. It's just risky enough to be different from your average cafe fare. With more locations popping up in Utah and Arizona (and \"other states to follow soon,\" according to their website), it's apparent that as a restaurant Zupas is more interested in growth (read: profit) than making an impact in the culinary world. In other words, it seems their focus is more on creating a menu that everyone will enjoy rather than true culinary innovation. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that as long as that's what their going for.\n\nI ate at Cafe Zupas last night for a friend's birthday dinner. I had a honey bacon club panini, which I enjoyed, although it was cold and somehow seemed grow soggier with every bite I took. The shrimp and sausage gumbo soup was alright; I found the shrimp disappointing. It was mealy and the size of shrimp you would find in a Cup of Noodles.

They always give you a piece of delicious bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry if you get a pick 2 combo. \n\nI am finicky when it comes to sandwiches because I really do make some pretty decent ones at home. Every single thing I have ordered (listed above) has met and exceeded my expectations. Nothing has been bland, scarce, over seasoned, under seasoned, lacking complexity, or unpleasing to my palate. I just order my food and know that it will be good, actually great. They have \"italian soda\" which is actually just adding sprite to your drink and then pumping in some flavor shots, but it's kind of fun. I like the atmosphere in the restaurant, but I don't understand why they have signs on every table telling you to not reserve a table. I don't get why it would matter.  I have not had a salad at Cafe Zupas, so I can not comment on that . However, my co-worker has gotten salads and she is even more finicky than I am about food and the fact that she didn't complain is a compliment.\n\nAs far as comparing to similar companies goes, I put them at the top for a few reasons. I have been severely disappointed by the Wildflower inside of Chandler mall because their French Onion Soup had a seasoning that did not belong there and threw off the whole flavor for me. Paradise Bakery is great and I do love their salads and sandwiches. However, I have started to find a lot of what they make too bland and I've noticed that one of my favorite salads got a makeover which I was not thrilled about. \n\nOne last thing, there were things about the sandwiches that I was initially disappointed about and then later decided that they were not an issue. At first, I didn't like that they lay the meat down flat since I like to cascade mine on the sandwich for a gentle fluffy type layer. I later decided that it was actually easier to eat their sandwiches this way and helped keep the sandwich together. I also initially felt that there was not enough meat ( and I am not a huge meat eater) , but later decided that it was the perfect amount to not overcome the other flavors in the sandwich. Someone who is a huge meat lover might be better off ordering a sub sandwich from another place. I am not a light eater by any means and sometimes come here around noon after only having coffee for the day, but I still end up having at a minimum, half of a sandwich for left-overs. \n\nThat's all!

I would come to this place more than once a week if I made more money than I do.  It is just one of those places.  \n\nI will give this place my official N.F.A. rating (no fucking around)\n\nHere is my typical experience when I come here.  Now, I have tried about 5-7 things off the menu here in my 100 visits or so and they are all awesome.  Fresh ingredients, lettuce doesn't taste like water, meat doesn't taste like Carl Budding, soft bread (god the bread here...damn...) and kick ass service.  My \"regular\" item takes a few minutes longer than the typical sub.  The owner sees me in line, has them start making it before I even order it so I don't have to wait as long. \n\nA-fucking plus.    \n\nLet's talk about the owner, shall we (I assume, might be the manager, not sure but he is always running the cash register)  This guy is awesome.  And I hate people.  He always asks how my days is going, making small talk, etc.  If I haven't been in for a while, he says things like \"been a while since I have seen you!\" \"how have you been?\" \"Come back more often!\"  He is the guy taking orders every time I have been there.  Since I am not a huge fan of soda, he always gives me a good size ice water and doesn't bitch about it or charge me for a cup.  That charging for a cup thing is horse shit and non-existent at this place.\n\nBy the way, no fee for using a debit/credit card either.  I almost always use cash, but a plus for you card users.\n\nThe restaurant is always clean.  Tables are free of garbage and left over food.  They always have the daily newspaper to read and I have never been pushed out of there if I read it after my meal is over.  The place doesn't smell of burned bread or rotten meat either, like a lot of other sandwich shops.\n\nIf I had to make a complaint it would be that there is no bathroom here for customers.  The place is small and probably lacks the resources for it.  Plus I bet it would piss off the health department if they knew customers were walking through the food prep area to wash their hands which is why it doesn't happen.  Know this before going there and piss/shit and wash your hands beforehand and the bullet has been dodged.  If these instructions are too hard for you, then I assume natural selection will eventually pay you a visit anyway.  I look for any way to cut down a business and with this place I really can't find one.  Can't ding a star for their shitter (or lack of) \n\nIf you are in the area and want a good meal, decent price (about 1-2 bucks more than the crappy national chains but after you eat you know where that money went) and good quick service, than give this place a try.

The steak was flavorless and dry, bread was chewing inside like it should be but dry and crumbly outside like it was left out for hours prior to service. Bobby was good like back home except the stuffing was off and tasted a bit of stove top and the bread was the same as the steaks.

One of the employees told her that the wrap was a smaller portion, so she asked for the wrap without a tortilla. The other employee couldn't get it through her head that that wasn't to be rung up as a salad. In the end, the first employee ended up giving her the smaller salad as a \"wrap,\" but it was a lot of grief over something pretty simple. \n\nI like that they have healthy options. It's weird that they have everything set up like a health-food Chipotle, but they don't let you just customize whatever you want - you have to pick something off the menu and then you can switch a couple things around if you wanna have the conversation with them about it. There are a lot of proteins and \"superfoods,' like kale, that you can add for like a dollar. I did that, but I have to say, $8.47 is a little on the pricy side for a salad, even if it was pretty big. I asked for dressing on the side and there was still dressing put on the salad. Oh well. I'm not really a big complainer, and it was good-tasting dressing anyways\n\nThey shake up the salads for you, which I actually kind of liked because I hate it when all the toppings are gone in the first few bites. It was a good salad, the superbiotic one. I was more or less satisfied.\n\nOh, and they take M&G.

Well, at that time, I visualized this place as a buffet with unappetizing lettuce leafs and drippy salad dressing, like the salad bar in a university cafeteria that I never visited. Given that I was generally skeptical of my vegetarian friend's recommendation and particularly skeptical of how good soup-and-salad can possibly be, the idea of a double date there was ... kind of out of the question.\n\nNow I have the good fortune of living really close to a Sweet Tomatoes. Now I want to go there all the time, whether it is a single, double, triple, quadruple, or quintuple dates!\n\nThings I love about Sweet Tomatoes:\n\n1) Seasonally changing menu. The menu features the freshest ingredients in season and the low price reflects that. Last month I experienced an Asian-inspired buffet, and this week is a potato-fest. I like surprises!\n\n2) Amazing salads. I would have to spend 7~10 bucks on some bland, refrigerated boxed salad from places close to where I work. But why get that if I can build my own delicious salad, for almost the same price (plus other amazing goodies)? The dressing, by the way, is the reason why I don't attempt to make my own salad at home. \n\n3) Warm, yummy cornbread and muffins. In restaurants serving good bread, I would finish a whole basket of complimentary bread before my entree. Yes, I am a carb snob and in desperate need of portion control when it comes to carbs. Here, I love the selection of mini-bite, fresh-out-of-the-oven cornbread, orange/cranberry muffins, chocolate brownies, and blueberry muffins. The are the perfect size, and give me a warm and fuzzy feeling inside.\n\n4) Homemade soups. I love all the Sweet Tomatoe chicken soups: the clear-broth chunky chicken noodle soup, and the creamy chicken wild rice soup. I tried the curry lentil soup and I remember it made me very happy. The soup selection changes every time I go but I think the chunky chicken noodle soup is a staple.\n\n5) Helpful, friendly staff. People are super friendly there. They would walk around and give out a plate of warm and gooey chocolate-chip cookies to tables where people almost finish with their meal. The staff not just smile to you, but also talk to you. Each food item is labeled clearly with a description of the ingredients, but apparently I can ask for recipes as well!\n\n*A side note: the staff really care about food hygiene. I noticed one time the lady filling the salad bar had some mushrooms fell outside the tray. She didn't put them  back (even though there were literally on the verge of the salad tray) but threw them away. It is really basic, but I don't think all restaurants have trained their employees to do that.\n\n6) Kid-friendly environment. I always lament the fact that kids don't eat their vegetables. To get them to eat veggies, you probably have to wrap a celery stick in bacon, put on a buttermilk batter, and deep fry it in butter. I think Sweet Tomatoes is helping to change our food culture. I am very proud of the kids I have seen at the Sweet Tomatoes who eat a hearty serving of vegetables before digging into the frozen yogurt!\n\nMaybe I am writing an unnecessarily long review. But I think this place deserves more applause! True, it is not on your Micheline star guide, not the one-of-a-kind neighborhood gem, never featured on Man v. Food or Triple D, and surely not where you would call for an anniversary dinner reservation. \n\nIt is simple, fresh, lovely, inexpensive, and best of all, in moderation.

I feel betrayed.  I've been a longtime fan of Sweet Tomatoes for years, and ate at this location and other locations in different states.  I always enjoyed their endless salad, soup, starches, and dessert, and was skeptical of the new \"Field Kitchen\" experience.  We went here yesterday and saw that they remodeled the whole kitchen to serve an a la carte menu only.  Prices for entrees ranged from around 8-11 dollars, and they included more meat options, such as rotisserie chicken, and steak and shrimp skewers.  \n\nSuch a drastic change in their business model is a risky gamble, since the Sweet Tomatoes experience is so well-engrained in longtime customer's heads such as mine.  Part of the experience that I so enjoyed about this restaurant chain was that I could get a little bit of everything, and mix and match things as I wanted to.  I also loved their pre-made salads such as the tarragon tuna and the wonton chicken salad, and now they are gone from the menu.  The closest thing they have to the previous buffet is a make your own salad with one cup of soup and unlimited soft serve.  The price is cheaper ($7.99) and the portion of salad that you will ultimately make is quite large, but for me the best part of Sweet Tomatoes was getting a little bit of each pre-made salad, starch, and soup rather than making a huge salad made with all the same ingredients.  \n\nAnother thing that was weird was that at the end of the salad line, there were no free range dressings, although you could pick out your own toppings and greens for your salad.  There is someone at the kitchen counter that actually gets your desired dressing out for you and pours it over your salad.  I foresee that this might cause some problems as the salad line gets backed up because only one person can pour your dressing for you vs. being allowed to choose and pour your own dressing.\n\nNow, I have to admit, since changing over to an a la carte menu, the food has improved in taste, although the prices are a bit high for some items. For instance, my husband had the steak wedge salad ($9.99).  The salad portion was fairly big since it was a wedge of iceberg lettuce, but the 2 skewers of beef were small, and already precooked so they tasted like they had been sitting out for some time.  If they grilled the skewers right in front of you, that would make the high price more explainable, but for me, it didn't seem like a good deal for what you got.  \n\nAs for the new paying system, you will be given a card, and whenever you order an item an associate will swipe your card to add charges to it.  Once you are done, you pay at one of the two cashier's booths.  Tip is automatically included at 7.5%, which I thought was weird.

What the heck.  \n\nThe new Field Kitchen concept is \"ok\".  It needs some tweaking!  The biggest problem I think I had was that I wasn't expecting it.  If I return knowing what I am getting into, I'd probably enjoy it more.  We went in there hoping for a lot of food for not a lot of cash.. but alas, Sweet Tomatoes has gone a la carte.\n\nThe first station is salad: you can get a specialty salad or make-your-own.  The make-your-own version is comparable to what we went in for.  At the end, you get the option to add meat, skewers, etc for another couple dollars.  The make-your-own salad comes with a bowl for soup (or macaroni.. because that's a soup) and a waffle cone for soft-serve ice cream later.  Swipe your little FK credit card.\n\nNext station is bread and sides.  The bread is free, whew.  Every other side is priced individually.  We got samples during our preliminary tour... they were good.  I'll tell you, if bread hadn't been included, we'd have staged a revolution.  If you want some pasta or other side... swipe the FK CC.\n\nThe last station is beverages, where you can get a fountain drink with free refills, or a special juice, or a bottled beverage.  Swipe that card.\n\nIf you want dessert beyond the ice cream (IF you got it included with your make-your-own salad) you can return to that station for a cookie, cheesecake, etc.  Swipe!\n\nAfter you eat, you give your little card to a cashier and pay.  You cannot leave the restaurant without a card.  I'm not gonna lie, that creeps me out.\n\nSooo quality of the food: Salad was comparable to before, but there were no mixed greens?  Either spinach or iceberg.  Not my fav.  Macaroni and cheese has gone downhill.  As I mentioned, the samples we tried were good, but I declined purchasing more food.  \n\nConcept: Interesting.  The biggest flaw was that each station had only a small counter for resting one's tray, so in addition to carrying that tray to and fro, one must also stand and hold it as they wait their turn to swipe the FK card.  Too much tray holding.  I liked when I could put it down, slide once, carry once, and we're done.\n\nPrice: For a comparable meal, price is just slightly higher, I think, than it was.  If you give in to all the up-selling, I imagine you could spend quite a lot pretty easily.\n\nService: Great, actually!  I think they about tripled their staff.  There was someone around every turn ready to help.  I can only imagine the rigorous training they'd just been through, and they were at attention the whole time.

Today was the grand reopening of this location after months of being Field Kitchen. The menu is for the most part, the same as it was before the Field Kitchen conversion, but the interior still holds the swanky bistro feel. The dinnerware also has the same nice cups, plates, and bowls that Field Kitchen had. We went for lunch, where they had some staff outside entering people for a raffle for 52 free meals. They were very friendly and very eager to make sure this new, yet familiar experience would be good for all the customers.\n\nYour old standard dishes are back, such as the tuna tarragon and the broccoli salad, although the wonton salad is now chicken-less (At least for this month). There seems to be slightly less of a selection of toppings for your salad, to be replaced be more dressing options (Including some unique ones like smokey bacon and mango basil). As a throwback to the previous Field Kitchen days, they do offer some a la carte skewers of rosemary chicken, and fresh mozzarella with tomato for a little over a dollar. Since they nixed the fresh fruit bar during the Field Kitchen experiment, they had to move the puddings, mousses, and fresh fruit into a smallish corner of the salad bar portion of the restaurant.\n\nThe drink station is pretty awesome. There's an automated soda machine with a touch screen that has a plethora of soda and water choices with various flavor additions if you so desire. They have an increased selection of diet sodas, such as diet Seagram's ginger ale (With various flavor additions like lime), and diet Barq's (There's an option for regular diet, or vanilla diet, very cool!). There's a nice selection of teas, including a very tasty mango ginger tea, as well as various regular and strawberry lemonades.\n\nThe soups seem to be the same quality and quantity. In addition to the standard chicken noodle soup, they had at least 2 different chilis, a tomato soup, and a rich and hearty posole with big chunks of pork in it, just to name a few. The bakery selection is limited on the muffin side, although they have the same pizzas and focaccias as they did before. When we went they only had brownies and blueberry muffins available. These muffins are huge compared to the usual sized Sweet Tomatoes muffins, about twice the size of the previous mini-muffins.\n\nThe pasta section was probably the most improved since the transition back to Sweet Tomatoes. The pasta was nicely cooked, and I was a big fan of the spicy marinara. It had lots of spicy kick, and a nice rich tomato flavor. The mac and cheese seems to have improved as well.\n\nI didn't try any of the soft serve, but they still had the standard vanilla/chocolate combo, with the various toppings and sauces to go with it.\n\nService was cheerful and friendly as always. After we paid, we got a 15% off coupon to use for the whole month of April. Nice!\n\nThere are a lot of good options for restaurants in this area now, with the opening of Spokes, the reopening of Sweet Tomatoes, and the highly anticipated opening of Los Reyes De La Torta.

Normally I try to stay away from small sized Mexican restaurants because the food usually isn't all that great and a little on the greasy side.

The first restaurant that showed up was Los Favoritos so I decided to give it a try seeing how the numerous reviews gave the restaurant a good rating. My favorite burrito to order at any kind of Mexican restaurant is a good old fashioned breakfast burrito with ham, cheese, and potatoes. So I ordered the ham breakfast burrito which I think at Los Favoritos their specialty is in fact the breakfast burritos, I could be wrong. \n\nThe wait was not long at all and I could hardly wait to start eating my burrito when it was handed to me. Of course you have to try both of the sauces, which were your typical red and green. The burrito was sooo good, I've ordered burritos from everywhere around Phoenix and this breakfast burrito was among the best. The burrito was far from greasy, you know when you're eating a greasy burrito when the grease pools down from your hand into the wrapper but this wasn't the case. The ham was moist and chunky, the eggs were, you know, eggs, and the potatoes were crunchy. They reminded me of hash browns which I thought was really good because it gave the burrito a different texture. The sauces made the burrito even more tasty and moist but they weren't as spicy as I'd like them to be. \n\nOverall, I give Los Favoritos Taco Shop 4 stars out of 5.

For the longest time I thought nothing could compare to other burger joinsts around town, but I was wrong after eating at Smashburger.  I order the Bacon Cheesburger everytime and it's delicious.  Make sure you get their Smash Fries those are delicious as well. \n\nThe service is fast.  The give you a number and bring the food to you when it is ready.  They have a few people come around to check on you to make sure you are doing ok. They have outdoor seating as well which Is great for this time of year. \n\nThe only thing that irritated me was when placing my order they ask If I would like to donate $1 to an organization.  Don't get me wrong I don't mind donating a dollar here and there.  But when I tell them no not this time they say, \"oh man, I just need five more to be done.\" Talk about putting me on a guilt trip.  \n\nService is great. Food is great.  Will definitely be coming back.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Service was excellent, I had the Avocado Club Smashburger, my husband had the chicken version of the same. Both were mouth watering delicious!!  The veg fries, fried green beans and carrot stix, were great with the horseradish sauce and the smash fries, thin crispy potato fries tossed in olive oil and rosemary, were fabulous with smash sauce.

The place was packed, but we found a table, and the service was fast, considering. I thought the food was great (Classic Smashburger, and we split some haystack onions and rosemary fries). My mom thought it was way too salty, but mine was fine.\n\nI would have given five stars, but here it is several hours later and I feel like I've been heavily dosed with MSG. Their menu says they don't use it, but their food is the only thing out of the ordinary that I've eaten today, and I can't get enough water and I feel hungover. My rings are tight and my mouth has that weird swollen tingly feeling that I only get from consuming MSG.\n\nGreat food, great service, not so great feeling later.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Awesome burgers and service!

The burgers are on the expensive side, for what you get. I tried the bacon cheeseburger. The thing I was impressed by was the fries, which have a great seasoning on them. My burger was tainted by my last bite which had a piece of cartilage in it. The best way to sum it up is restaurant prices for a fast food burger. Due to my tainted burger, I will give them one more chance. I will do a new review once I do with an update.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I've given this place a few chances to get more stars,  but I keep getting disappointed. \nFirst time, burger was not fully cooked and my smash fries were cold. The burger was still tasty and fries were too, just don't like cold fries.\nNext time in, my smash fries were hot but no rosemary and garlic......well there was a hint on a few fries. I also tried the onion thingies and the we're bland and burnt. Well I should say they tasted burnt with no seasoning flavor. \nI give it 3 stars for good, friendly service and the hamburgers were good.

Very fresh meat.  Great fries (seasoned with rosemary) and battered fried onions.  Would have given 5 stars.\nVisit #2 - same meal.  Fries were cold and greasy.  3 stars.\nVisit #3 - Our burgers were overcooked, the patties were falling apart in the bun.  Both the fries and onions were cold and had pools of grease at the bottom of their containers.  The batter was completely falling off the onions.  0 stars.\nAt this point, I'm not so sure I would go back.  $18 for a couple of burgers is pricey.

I ussually have to think a while before I decide on a score, but this one is truly a 2.  We went there once, I ussually do not like to rate places after only 1 visit, but I really understood this place after one visit, well enough to write my review.  I think it tries to present burgers in a \"Chipotle\" kind of way, is it \"fast\"? \"fine\"? or \"casual\"? No one knows.  I think it is fast food dressed up like fine food in a casual way.  However, I think it doesn't hit any of those very well.\nIt is sorta fast, but not as fast as McDonalds, but faster than Applebees.  It is seasoned like fine food, probably better than McDonalds, but is not even as good as Applebees (which isn't very \"fine\").  It is sorta casual, less casual than McDonalds, more casual than Applebees. \nThe food is ok.  For the money I expect more.  I think if they were a drive through competeing with Wendys and Whataburger then would do fine.  But I am not getting out of my car for Smashburger very often.  If I am going to go in and order a mediocre burger, and over pay and wait, then I am at least going to go into a proper restaurant and sit down at a comfortable table.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "AMAZING PLACE!
