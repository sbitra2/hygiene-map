I mean, I shot 110) and enjoyed this 18 more than any other (except for a course I once played in Orlando with my father, for sentimental reasons). \n\nThe course was very well kept, much better than any I've played on in Miami or southern LA. First time playing in Arizona was beautiful and amazing to appreciate the contrast between the red clay and green, green fairways. \n\nNot much water, but just enough for me to lose 3 balls in it (I lost 9 total, again, I'm not that good). Freeways line the start of the back 9.  A little distracting. I think I hit 3 balls into ongoing traffic. Regardless, it only got better from there. \n\nGorgeous 13th and 15th and 16th holes, among the others. Beautiful semi-island par-3 on 18. I played until dark, nailed a 20ft put, almost birdied 3 in a row, and had an awesome time - very memorable - and happy as hell I took the initiative to play 18 on my day off even though its not my sport. \n\nI would recommend it.

If I were to golf I would never get past the first hole and take too much time.  Others seem to enjoy it and yell when the ball gets close or into the hole.  For me riding my bike is far more enjoyable and very scenic with great views of Four Peaks and sunsets behind Camelback.\n\nOver the past several years I have collected hundreds of stray golf balls.  I save the uniquely marked ones from other golf courses including Silverado but otherwise box the others up.  I have offered them to my nephews to sell but there was little interest.

We were somewhat slow due to the fact that we had our other twosome play from the womens tees.  I have nothing against the ladies, but the marshall should know that it takes an average of 90 seconds to get back in your cart and have the other group tee off!\n-The caddies that helped clean our tees, which we generously tipped, made remarks Charlie Sheen would be proud of: said we played a 4:30 round (when it was 4:20), argued about the marshall pushing us, and overall was focused on proving some unknown point to a paying customer!\n\nSuggestion: \n-Don't play here!

This is a fine golf course.  It is in excellent condition.  The front nine is somewhat boring as it is basically straight out and straight back.  The back nine offers a little more challenge and a few more interesting holes.\n\nA warning to walkers:  The front nine is easily walked, but the back nine is tough as there are VERY long stretches from green to tee.\n\nI played it on 11-24-11 in the first group of the day.  The greens were pretty slow, but that was probably because there was a heavy dew that morning and the greens were still pretty wet.  As they dry out during the day, they probably run a little faster, but will still be just moderate speed greens.\n\nIt's a straightforward course, with no tricks off the tee.  The 10th hole is a sharp dogleg right with a blind tee shot.  Other than that, you can see the shot you need to hit from every tee box.  The finishing hole is a moderate, downhill Par 3 over water.
