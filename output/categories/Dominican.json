We were so happy to have a new place to try and equally happy with the food. They have only been open for two days and still making plans for growth inside the Restaurant. We started off with the mambo platter with Dominican friend chicken and pork. Well the thumbs went up and smiles erupted from everyone's face. Our Friends that joined us that evening are from Jersey and this type of food is popular back there and they were thrilled. The Cuban sandwich was a huge hit and the pickles inside are scrumptious, giving it that perfect snap. The others had pork platters with yellow rice, they licked their plates clean so that was a good indication that it was fantastic. I really enjoyed the Dominican fried chicken, great seasoning on the outside and very moist on the inside. They have a pretty good sized menu and serve breakfast and amazing looking deep dish pizzas and wings. So there are plenty of choices for everyone.\nWe look forward to dining here again!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I've had a better cuban sandwich at Village Inn.

Maybe if we ate in the restaurant things would have gone better.  One big plus for Mambo's--they poked holes in the Styrofoam containers containing items that should remain crispy such as french fries and plantains.\n\nWhat we ordered:  Mambo Platter (large) \n                                  Cuban Sandwich\n                                  Ham and Cheese Empanada\n                                  Seasoned Ground Beef Empanada\n\nThe large Mambo platter is HUGE and way too much for two people.  Since my husband did the ordering and pick up, I know he thought he'd want leftovers if the food was good.  Too bad that wasn't the case with the Mambo Platter.  The pork rinds were way overcooked and pretty much inedible.  The plantains were bland and blah.  The Dominican Fried Chicken was pretty good but also overcooked a bit.  Not recommended as takeout.  Not sure I'm willing to shell out $12.00 to try it again at the restaurant (that's the price for the small platter).   The large platter cost us a whopping $22.00.  Way too much for the quality we received even though it was a huge portion.\n\nThe Cuban Sandwich was decent.  It was pretty well packed with meat and had good flavor.  It could have been pressed for just a couple more minutes to get that great crunch on the outside and the gooey melt in the middle with the cheese.   Came with bland, underdone french fries.  Reasonably priced at $6.50. \n\nThe standouts from this meal were the empanadas.  Both kinds were excellent!  Wish we'd ordered a shredded chicken one as well.  These tasty treats are the reason I'm willing to go back to Mambo's and try again.  I'd say again and again for the empanadas.  A bargain at $1.50 each, they are deep-fried yumminess.  I'm used to the Mexican sweet  baked version but wanted to try these savory babies.  So glad I did.  If the other food had been on par with these, my review would have been a solid 4.  \n\nI'm definitely going to give Mambo's another try because I'm already craving their empanadas.  Can't speak about their service because I wasn't there but the hubby didn't complain so it much have been okay.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Delicious!
