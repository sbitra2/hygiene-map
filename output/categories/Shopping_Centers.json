You see, no such thing exists where I'm from. Sure, you'll find your traditional mall and the occasional plaza in Oklahoma City, but nothing like a Tempe Marketplace that is a mini-world of consumerism. \n\nBut, out of all the outrageous retail developments I've seen, this is my favorite of its kind. (I can't, for some reason, stand Desert Ridge or Mesa Riverview.) Perhaps it's the design or even the landscaping, but I admit I am drawn here. Not because I have to go to every single store (I don't even know all of what's here), but because out of all the the places to shop, this one stresses me out the least. It's true!\n\nI guess I should admit the fact that I don't really like shopping. And I hate malls. So, yes, this is a pretty big deal: 3 stars from me for a Retailopolis. \n\nIn any case, here's a couple reasons I'd go here:\n\n*Barnes & Noble - Every big development needs a huge book store. Sure, it's not your mom and pop's establishment, but it's books, music, magazines, maps and everything else you want to distract yourself with, including coffee and amazing deserts (a few from Cheesecake Factory). Try the PB Cookie, though. It's my fave.\n\n*World Market - Ah, the wine you'll find here! Prices are reasonable and the selection is great. Organized by country, you'll be able to, in the matter of minutes, explore the world of wine. They sell some of my faves here, including Acacia, Row Eleven, Sexto. Plus, you'll be able to explore other brands that offer new alternatives, including Mark West. If wine's not your thing, check out the beer selection. While limited, it may surprise you with some of what they offer. As for everything else, I could take it or leave it. After all, if I wanted candles or dinner sets, I'd shop elsewhere. \n\n*Target - Sure as hell beats Wal-Mart, which I haven't stepped foot in for over 4 years. C'mon, it's the \"upscale discounter.\" Need I say more?\n\nThere are so many other stores here, too, including Old Navy, Ross and JC Penny. Not to mention they've built restaurants around the area for hungry shoppers. Only, instead of seeing a hoard of mediocre pubs, I'm excited to see there's a place that offers sushi and one that offers tea. (Kabuki and Tea Infusion, respectively.)\n\nOf course, maybe I spoke too soon. For if you visit the Web site, you'll see the plans for development, which includes more places to dine and several more stores, including Wet Seal, Hot Topic, Buckle, Levi's and Sam's Club. (Ugh. I hate anything Sam Walton....)\n\nYes, there is a Dave & Buster's here, if that's your thing. It's an okay time. Just don't expect to stumble into anything you wouldn't find at Desert Ridge. \n\nWhat else? \nOh yes, the music. When you get out of your car, you instantly hear music playing throughout the parking lot. It varies, from Matchbox 20 to tunes you'd hear at a lounge. \n\nEven better, every Third Thursday of the month, they offer free live music. (This was also the place for the SoCo Music Experience, which was free admission with great acts like Clap Your Hands Say Yeah and Cold War Kids). \n\nI admit it, I do like this place. My only beef would be 1. Traffic and 2. Parking.  It seems they could have done a better job of engineering the traffic flow and organizing the parking lots to reduce the amount of confused stops and cross-traffic turns as possible. But, hey, that's just me thinking down the road - when people begin to swarm this place and neglect to turn their attention on their driving, instead of the racks and aisles of clothes and goodies awaiting them.\n\nFor me, that's the biggest turn-off. You see, this place offers SO much, it's going to be a mad house, no matter what day or time you go. I've gone in the middle of the afternoon and was shocked to see the parking lot packed with vehicles. So, while I may want to go here, I probably won't. I just can't deal with swarms of shoppers. That's the entire reason I avoid malls and do most of my shopping online. Blasted! But sometimes it's fun to go wander around stores and stumble into a new shirt of pair of pants you can't live without... \n\nCome to think of it, why can't people leave a good thing alone? Must there be a Restaurant Row with 10 different places to grab a bite? Must there be stores stacked upon stores stacked upon stores? I mean, it's such a turn-off to know that you're going to have to deal with a ridiculous amount of people on any given day... and that you can't enjoy just walking around the area, exploring boutiques and shops you've never seen. You're always going to be dodging \"crazy shopping people\" and \"big lady purses.\" Ugh.

Made by the same development company, the layout of the place is similar (but worse) to D.R. with \"The District\" in the center, and the big stores surrounding it, separated by a vast impenetrable wasteland of parking lot. The District is an admirable concept I think. It's like a traditional mall but at least there's an attempt to move forward on it by making it outdoors? That's cool when it's nice out, but when it's 139 degrees out, the misters are in full amazon jungle force. The biggest gripe I have about the place is the layout of the place. The design is horrendous. \n\nFirst of all, it just irritates me how the giant flashy signs face the 202, beckoning unknowing, random passersby to come shop there. Meanwhile, the entire shopping center's fat ass is planted firmly and stubbornly toward Tempe, the city it's supposed to represent. The drive past Tempe Marketplace on Rio Salado features a glorious view of the backs of Pier One and Old Navy and Target's loading docks. It's ugly. And most importantly, it didn't need to be designed that way. \n\nSecondly, this place is one of the least pedestrian friendly strip malls in Tempe. Which is shitty because it's also one of the newest. Our planning and development should be propelling forward, not going backward. Does the developer know anything about the city it's in? Does it represent that? If you're going to create a mega structure like Tempe Marketplace, shouldn't it at least vaguely represent the qualities of its city? Tempe Marketplace is impossible to walk around when you're outside The District. If you wanted to, for example, walk from BevMo to Pier One, you must first throw yourself into a the middle of  a harrowing situation. There are no well designed sidewalks or walkways across the meandering, confusing road systems. You must just walk across the parking lot. Between the speeding frat boys in Mustangs and the SUV driving soccer moms who've gotta get to Sport Chalet FAST and have no time for pedestrians, Tempe Marketplace simply does not account for two major facts about its environment, and thus its consumer: people will be walking, and people will be riding bikes. And it didn't need to be designed that way. \n\nAnd then there's Big Brother-esque advertisements that are going on via loud speaker all the time. What's up with that? I love the one with the most anglo sounding chick they can find harping about how great \"San Feleep's\" cafe is. You can't even pronounce the place's name right and you're doing an ad for it?

Each time I have been there, its usually been for the same things, and Ive had, to some degree, about the same experience while I have been there. But, each time I return, I find another reason to either like or hate this place. Like the music selection for this place. Enough music from 1995/Rob Thomas's \"smooth Album\" to make anyone nuts. and so much more. READ ON my friends, READ ON! \n\nReasons to like Tempe Marketplace: \nA) They have a great selection of stores here. Target, Michael's, Best Buy, Old Navy and a few others that make me happy. These are just a few of the stores that surround the location! There's more inside! \n\nB) Great Movie theatre in here. also, a lot of restaurants to dine out at as well. Yippie! \n\nC)They have stages for performances, and its a lot of fun to see bands play on the weekends when the weather is nice. Place is also clean, and I like the decorations and seating options here as well. \n\nReasons to hate it \nA) HORRIBLE parking and driving is just as bad here. There are about a zillion stop signs and 4 way stops, and if you try to come out of one of the parking lots (like lets say from Barnes and Noble) into the driving part of the road, its impossible to get in and out of that lot, especially on a busy weekend evening. \n\nB)This place is so spread out. you literally cant park in front of Target and think your going to walk to Lucille's, or anywhere within reason. Why did they do that? Not all of us want to take that hike to Ruby Tuesdays from Target. Especially when its 115. BAD! \n\nC) Last night is a prime example of the \"little things\" that I keep noticing. I was trying to locate a directory because I was trying to remember what restaurants were in the area and to discuss with the person that was with me as to where we were going to eat. This is a normal course of action that occurs when you go out with others. We walked to a directory area, and it was loaded with advertisements!! NO DIRECTORY. UGH. \n\nD) Lastly, THEY PLAY THE WORST OVERHEAD MUSIC AS WELL. If I have to hear one more Matchbox 20/Rob Thomas song while I am here, I am going to yell and scream. Its like 1995 ALL over again.

As a shopping center, it's not too convenient because you pretty much have to drive everywhere within the center.  The Target is a 10 minute walk from the movies and the Best Buy is a 15 minute walk from the BevMo.  I'm not lazy-ass (okay, I am, but not when it comes to walking), but this is a shopping center, a \"marketplace\" if you will, things should be a stone's throw from each other.  Considering how the place is laid out, if you do this enough times on foot, you're bound to get hit by a car.  You're going to be like, \"Yay, I bought Mario Galaxy 2, now I'm going to get a bottle of--BOOM!!\" and you're dead.  \n\n2.  I ride my bike everywhere and, yeah, like I said earlier, I'm terrified of getting smacked by a car.  There are no bike lanes and sidewalks that end randomly.\n\n3.  Got my bike light stolen there once and I held a grudge.\n\n4.  The place reeks of Axe Bodyspray.  \n\nThere are, however, benefits to it:\n\n1.  It's not trashy.  As lame as it sounds, this is really important sometimes.  Sometimes trashy things are delightfully fun, but when trashiness is not applied correctly it can end with terrible things happening (tweekers stripping down naked and crying).  Tempe Marketplace is definitely the kind of place that wouldn't know how to do trashy correctly, they'd end up having some redneck bar where people constantly homophobic things.  Sometimes I appreciate a place where I can bring my mom without having to explain what some graffitied wall said.  \"Mom, it's when a man and a man love each other very much....\"\n\n2.  Most places there to plug your gut are at least pretty okay.  No McDonald's, nothing like that.  Most places you stop into have a pretty decent spread with a bar and you can eat pretty well.  I like that.\n\n3.  The combination of having a movie theater and a Dave and Busters is a great one.  You can have a few shots and beers, shoot some zombies in the face and then watch whatever stupid action movie is playing this Summer.\n\n4.  Plenty of bike racks.

Since I have little time or desire to shop, it just hadn't occured to me that TMP offers so much more. As we enjoyed our ice cream outdoors and had strolled around, I noticed people hanging out playing cards, sipping coffee in cushioned chairs, sitting by the fountains and the fireplace, no hurried holiday hustle to grab some random gift of which with many stores there are plenty but all just enjoying a fun place to hang out.

When I think of going to see a movie, I immediately think of this spot. For the most part, Tempe Marketplace has a ton to offer, but it is still not the best Mall of All...as they would say. Lets shop around and explore Tempe \nMarketplace:\n\n~What To Do~\nA lot of shopping options are available, from groceries at Target to clothes at Ross...They have specialty stores like Hi-Health or BevMo. They also have your Run-of-the-mill usual mall shops along the main walkway, with stores like Gap and Bath & Bodyworks. Finally, as for restaurants, they provide a bevvy of options, from Asian, Fro-yo/Ice Cream, as well as a couple separate bars. Finally, they have the Harkins here which has a Cine Capri...my favorite theatre in town!\n\n~The Good~\nThere are a number of major bright spots, mostly coming by way of the movie theater, which is well run and always has the right start time for whichever movie I want to see. One of my favorite bar treats is the Thirsty Lion Pub and Grill, which offers nicer bar fare as well as wide variety of craft brews. The make-up of the entire center is conducive to what you are looking to do. The Marketplace is spread out enough that you will be able to find parking wherever you go...save for the back entrance near the movie theater on a Friday/Saturday night. The shear amount of options available to the patron is also a bright spot, much alike most outdoors malls these days. The best thing to note is that there is something for everyone, heck they even have Dave & Busters for the kids if they want to play games while you go drink at San Felipes!\n\n~The Bad~\nSan Felipes. =haw= I love digging into them. Horrible service, waitresses who only cater to the males, and drinks that come from packages and pack so much sugar that it will give you type 3 diabetes.... that's right, type 3. Service there blows, so that's a consistent for you. Also, parking can blow on weekends when you want to go somewhere specific. I like to walk so it doesn't bother me, but it sure bothers my fiance. Another low-spot are the few stores that have boarded up of recent.  It sucks when a store shuts down, even if you had never gone in before. Seeing a bunch of stores boarded up is exponentially worse. The entertainment zones vary along the main walkway, so some stores have made while others have fallen. Hopefully they can get it together and figure out how to retain the right tenants.\n\n~The Downlow~\nGreat spot to blow a few hours of time before seeing a movie. The bar options (besides San Felipes) are serviceable, and the ability to pick and choose a specialty store is nice. It is on par with most outdoors malls here in the valley, hence the 3 star rating. Its just like most, no major distinguishing factor besides the theater. We are lucky to live in this town which offers such nice options to kill time...I think we take this for granted. Anyway, 3 stars overall, above average for most malls you'd go to nationwide, but just par here. They definitely need to nuke San Felipes. I'd suggest a military takeover; the incentive is they can procure all the liquor and sugar, which they would probably have to destroy. Who is with me!!?!??! FOLLOW ME!
