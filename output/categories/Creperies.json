A lot of the reviews with lower scores say that this place is expensive and this is simply not true in the slightest. The delicious organic, fair-trade coffee that is locally roasted costs $1.50 for a 8 oz mug. The pour-over coffee which makes the coffee really strong and gives it a silty quality not unlike Turkish coffee costs $1.70. I've been to a LOT of coffee shops and have never seen that offered. Plus, it's so flavorful that a person like me who usually drinks coffee with cream and sugar drank the pour-over black. Not because it's sweet, but that it's just so rich and flavorful. The espresso is good and costs only $2 (it can be iced upon request).\n\nThe crepes were the best I've had since spending a month in France. They were also comparable in price. A super cheap crepe on the streets of Paris are around \u20ac2; here they were $4. I had the Nutella, banana and almond crepe. It was really good and completely filled me for several hours. The sweet crepes range from $4-$5. The salty crepes go up to $8, but are the most decadent crepes I've ever seen. I did not have one, so I can not judge how they taste. I also had the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookie that I've ever had in my life; cost $1.50, but it was dense...let me tell you!\n\nMaybe it's that I'm from the North Side of Chicago, but I thought the prices here were super cheap.

In Cairo, a lot of coffee shops and tea houses are shut down, and protesters would be limited to Turkish style coffee or Arabic style tea.  In Madison, there's an excellent, personable, unique bourgeois coffee shop serving organic fair trade coffee one block out from the state capital building (which is absolutely beautiful, protest or not) in literally every direction.  \n      Okay, so if you're in need of a cappuccino, served properly in a dainty cup with saucer, finished with a leaf shaped mark of steamed milk, and you walked  due north of the capital building from your protest, then here's your place.  Its main advantage over the ludicrous plethora of other quaint little coffee shops playing independent indie-rock in this college town, is its location. For those who want to walk from the capital, it's very convenient.  Other pluses are, it is a sunny little location, with friendly competent staff, tasty crepes (using Wisconsin produce and cheese), I recommend the spinach, cheese and mushroom.  The somewhat cramped interior is ringed with seats facing out to the two streets for solitary drinkers and their notebook computers, but the center has an L shaped low table with unfixed stools, making it perfect for group project work.  When you're protesting to preserve worker rights with a bunch of teachers, you want to proofread your placards for spelling and punctuation, these tables are perfect for neatly fixing those inappropriate apostrophes on protest signs with colorful Sharpies.  \n     It is a small location, but when I was in there, the turn-over was quick, and the coffee is excellent.  Although the location would seem to be convenient for the children's museum right next door, like most coffee shops, it's not really an appropriate place for young children, the space is tight, there's hot coffee everywhere, the tables are low, and \"the grown-ups are talking here.\"  If you're looking for a longer, solitary, coffee drinking and reading hide-out, there are better places for that near by, with more comfortable seating.  The prices are pretty comparable to the other campus and downtown area coffee shops.\n     Okay, properly re-caffeinated, its time to return to the fight for democracy in the Wisconsin workplace.

However, Bradbury's does carry savory crepes, and I was craving a work space with lots of light and some iced tea, so I came here today for a change from my usual coffeehouse rotation.\n\nThe space itself has very high ceilings, exposed duct-work, a unisex bathroom, and two walls consisting of floor-to-ceiling windows. It's not unlike eating in a greenhouse, and was very welcome on an overcast day like this, when natural light is difficult to find. The staff is very friendly and helpful (I accidentally dropped a coin in my iced tea at the counter, and the server poured me a new one over my \"oh, I don't want to be difficult\" protestations, which was a nice gesture). The single-occupancy bathroom is clean and not constantly occupied, given the dining area's small size. The restaurant keeps a list of the local farms from which they source their ingredients, which I appreciated. The food menu isn't huge, but there are multiple options for both sweet and savory crepes. I'm not sure they even could have a bigger menu, given the extraordinarily small kitchen in the place. To their credit, they even make scones and muffins in the tiny space as well (options today included Nutella muffins, and both dark chocolate and lemon-poppy-seed scones). There isn't a lot of sound-dampening, but the small space effectively limits the noise, and the overhead music is kept to a reasonable volume, and is not obtrusive. There are a number of outlets along the walls, and the breakfast-bar area along the windows is a great space to work. There's one small table which seats up to three, and an L-shaped long table configuration for larger groups or shared space seating. The chairs and stools are quite small, hard, and uncomfortable, though. My butt's going numb as I type.\n\nI ordered the pastrami crepe (which also contains sauerkraut, spicy Dijon mustard, pickled ramps, and a fried egg) and some mint rooibos iced tea. They did have two iced teas today, though they weren't on the menu, so it never hurts to ask, especially in summer. I was a little skeptical of the mint rooibos iced tea, having had both mint and rooibos tea, but never together. It tasted great, though, and the mint flavor was very refreshing on a languid, humid day. There was also a caffeinated black iced tea, in case you need more of a morning jolt. My companion had a latte and another savory crepe, which contained pesto, scrambled eggs, asparagus, and fresh mozzarella. The crepes were nearly room-temperature when they came out, though they were whisked directly to our spaces from the kitchen. My companion's pesto crepe had good flavors, but the pesto was cold, the mozzarella wasn't melted at all, and the large quantity of pesto was so overwhelming that it was difficult to taste much else. The asparagus was fresh and cooked perfectly, though. The stalks weren't too thick, which prevents them from tasting too woody or bitter, and the ends were clipped an appropriate amount. It could have used some more garlic and pepper flavors, less pesto, and a bit more heat. My crepe was a welcome slap to the senses - I love Dijon mustard and sauerkraut, and the pickled ramps were packed with flavor, though these ingredients could easily overwhelm a more delicate palate, especially in the morning. The pastrami was pretty gray and tough, though. The pickled ramps were also a mess to cut. The egg was cooked over medium, but they will serve over-easy eggs and rare or medium-rare meat if you request it (though I believe the pastrami was pre-cooked). It also could have stood to have more pepper, especially the pastrami, which was noticeably under-seasoned and almost unrecognizable as such. It was alright, but I'd likely order something else next time - maybe even a sweet crepe, since Yelpers seem much more enthusiastic about those. My companion liked his latte, though, and it looked beautiful, with lots of crema and perfectly-steamed milk.\n\nI don't see myself coming here regularly, but if sweet crepes and hot drinks are your idea of a great breakfast, you'd probably enjoy it more than I did.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "My third update: still the best coffee in Madison.

Ice Tango is all around Ice- Tasty. They also have multiple other flavors including mango (the flavor of the day today) and blueberry, which tickled my taste buds.\n\nBesides the yogurt I ordered, I tasted their vanilla frozen custard. Yum. The Russian Hubster (husband/ gangster) convinced the owner to make us a crepe. Delicious- and this coming from a former creperista myself. It was the perfect consistency. Moist on the inside with the a hint of crisp toward the outside. Our heavenly confection was filled with Nutella, nuts, banana slices, and nougat. Upon tasting it, my big and burly cousin actually giggled. There was no other way to describe it, anyhow. Just picture a muscular New Yorker, still sporting the shades, giggling.

The crepe also came with some fruit on the side. I like how they are specialized in crepes and not 10 different things and their menu may be short but from our Sonora crepe; I bet all the crepes on the menu are good too.\nThe decorations inside gave you a chic feel to it. The atmosphere was quiet and peaceful but the owners told us we came after the rush hour. We both talked to the owners and they were really nice. We found out that they make everything in the kitchen fresh every day. They're trying to make their own hummus. Outside they have some food and water so it's good if you want to bring your dog or cat with you. Although in the heat, I think the water would be boiling.

My only knock is the dark interior but the last time I checked, I'm not an interior designer and this all about the food and service which were both fantastic. It was very clean and modern inside and they even had a tv showing your crepes being made. The other great thing was that they served Illy Coffee and free refills, thats pretty awesome.

While being surrounded by these colors was a bit threatening to my masculinity, I was happy to see that they had ESPN playing on the TVs to compensate while I devoured my crepe.\n\nFor a light dinner, I went with The Razorback: a savory crepe filled with pork tenderloin, spices, potato, tomato and red onions. It reminded me of a pork tamale, just with a very light and fluffy exterior. The side of ripe diced watermelon that came with the crepe was also a nice touch to complement the meal. I was pleasantly surprised. Everything was artfully prepared, with even a hovering camera above the crepe station so that you can see it all in action.\n\nTheir drink menu is just as extensive as their crepes; with wines, spirits and beer to fulfill the alcohol needs; to juices, coffees and teas fit enough to cater to the coffeehouse connoisseur. They also offer some complementary cucumber water, which was very refreshing. Be sure to check out their imported premium soda chalkboard to see what they have. It's bound to cycle through some changes from time to time, but their choices of soda are always delicious.\n\nThroughout the entire visit, I was able to tell that the owners of this establishment run it with a passion.

I was super hungry so I wanted a filling-dinner type of crepe. He suggested The Bomber, w/ pepperoni added. He said you can add whatever you want to the crepe. Awesome. The Bomber has meatball, mozzarella, tomato sauce...and I added pepperoni to it. \n\nThe Bomber was definitely.... da bomb!

Even with that type of service, the owners check up on you to see if you need anything and if your enjoying your meal. I love that! That's what top notch customer service is about! :) \n\nMy 2nd crepe, my awesome bosses ordered us some from here. I had the Sonora. It includes: carne asada steak, roasted tomato salsa, guacamole, jack cheese. It also came with a side of fruit, pineapple. The fruit is different each time. :) Which I enjoy. That was delish as well. \n\nMy 3rd crepe, 2nd time here: I brought my friends along with me. It was nice too see the owners remembered me. :) I ordered the Caprese crepe and Mimosa trio sampler. You can choose 3 out of the 5 flavors available. I chose the lychee, passion fruit, and pomegranate. My FAVE was the lychee mimosa!!! I love lychee.... and I was excited to try that one. It was delicious! I wasn't a fan of the other flavored mimosa, but the lychee was my fave. \n\nThe Caprese was good. Melted mozzarella, tomato and basil. I loved the drizzle of pesto sauce over the crepe. \n\nI forgot what my friends ordered, but they enjoyed theirs as well. \n\nBy the time we scraped our plates clean, we were soooo full but still managed to order a dessert crepe or rather a \"Sweet Yum.\" We couldn't leave here without having one of those. So the three of us shared one. Got the Nutty Classic and added banana and strawberries! It was huge, and delicious! Nutty Classic includes nutella, fresh chopped hazelnuts, whipped cream, powdered sugar...and along with that we added the banana and strawberries! It was heaven! \n\nI'll have to try their other dessert crepes the next time I come in. \n\nWe all couldn't stop talking about the decor of the place. It's not what you would expect from the outside.

I don't eat much, but I eat well. That's also the best excuse *ever* to order too much and, if needed, send it home with Mom. ;)\n\nSavory: The Caprese (extra pesto, please!). The mozzarella was fresh and creamy, the tomatoes firm and bright and sweetly tangy, the basil was sweet and fragrant, and the pesto was... \n\n.\n.\n.\n\n... oh, uh, my apologies... I was daydreaming about the pesto. Thicker than some pestos, the flavors were deep - nutty, cheesy, garlicky, basily (are these words?!) - *without* being heavy or oily. Absolutely on my faves list now.\n\nSavory: The Grand Turk. Tender, tender turkey makes this crepe fantastic. The other ingredients: guacamole, olives, cheese, are great accompaniments, yes, but the Grand Turk is not just named for it's protein base, but truly because the turkey shines. Sauteed, it has a smokey roasted/grilled taste that really makes it stand out.\n\nSweet: The Avalon. Sauteed, buttered pears, walnuts, honey, and goat cheese. An amazing combination that ends up just sweet enough. The nuts and cheese keep the honey and pears perfectly balanced. I had only one wish, and I expressed this to Ana when she stopped over to chat, was that it had more of the goat cheese and the creamy tang that it imparts into the dish.\n\nSweet: The Frisco. Blueberries and lemon curd. One bite and Mom just smiled with that \"oh, yes, my mouth is happy\" look that she gets over good food. I loved the freshness of the berries, that ripeness that brings a perfectly sweet/tart juicy bite. Add the zest of an amazing lemon curd? Fab, fab dish! Ana even took the time to talk to us about how she worked through the dish to perfect it, and shared some ideas on lemon curd outside of the crepes! \n\nI mention a lot that I don't eat bread, rice, potatoes or pastas but for a small bite here and there. So, I can admit to leaving way more crepe behind on the plate than should be legal. That said, I *do* taste things, and I had quite a few tastes of the crepes themselves, not just the amazing filling. Light batter that packs a great flavor, perfectly griddled, and even consistency are important in a crepe. Crepe Expectations has got this hands down and, dare I say it, easily rivaling my favorite little spot in Seattle's Pike Market.\n\nAdd to all of this the lemon and cucumber waters (cool, tasty without being overpowering, and oh-so-refreshing!), the large menu of libations (coffees, teas, juices, wines... so many options!), there is something for every person (and to complement every crepe!).\n\nThe service is phenomenal.

The flavors of pear, goat cheese, and walnut were rich and delicious.  However, the honey was a bit overwhelmingly sweet.  I guess eating three bites instead of 30 at a time is better for me anyway.  More for later!\n\nSummary: great variety of food, friendly staff, ample creativity in dishes, good prices, I just wish the crepe to food ratio was a little higher.

Now I'm not the biggest crepe fan in the world (usually a little too sweet for me), but this place has plenty of tasty options, with a wide variety of coffees, beers, and wines.  \n\nIt's a solid place for a coffee date with some inventive food options.  The decor is stylish stone and slightly darkened.  I was there for breakfast, but it seemed like a decent, slightly quirky choice for a first date.\n\nThe crepes themselves are light and airy pancakes made mostly from eggs.  They're a classic option in French and Swiss breakfasts, but Crepe Expectations has taken the classic crepe and fused in a colorful variety of filling options.  \n\nWhile I was there, I started off with the Sonora.  We're in the SW and I wanted to know what the French crepe filled with filled with flank steak, fresh avocado and cheese would taste like.  The steak was properly cooked and still tender but I'm not sure if the Sonora is a great dish overall.  The steak is heavy and I appreciate a filling meal, but the crepe made the dish feel more like a wet burrito.  I loved the contents, just wasn't won over by the combination of crepe and burrito filling.\n\nI also had the Avalon--a crepe filled with goat cheese, honeyed pear and walnuts.  Dear god that is sweet.  A little too sweet.  I loved the consistency of the walnuts and the softened pears, but the honeyed pear completely overwhelmed the tartness in the goat cheese.  That said, I want to love this crepe.  Even sitting here, I want to reach back into the past and dial back the honey on the crepe.  When I took matters into my own hands, controlled what was on my fork, and made sure there was plenty of goat cheese, it was a really wonderful flavor combination.  \n\nThe coffee was well-roasted and rich.  And they had nice little touches, like offering cucumber water and lemon water with the meal.  The beer and wine menu had some nice small brewery/small winery options and I'm a big fan of this place.  All in all, Crepe Expectations has earned a firm spot in my brunch rotation.\n\nBased on the food, this place gets a solid 3.5 stars.  Inventive menu--that's pretty close to delicious even if the flavors were a little too sweet for me or a little off in my opinion.  The food was still prepared expertly and I do like imagination in a menu.  I threw in the extra .5 star because the staff is very welcoming and helpful.

Really?!  The cheese was gooey and everything was so flavorful.  My friends were debating which crepe was better of the two.  At that point I'm like, \"Who gives a f@ck?!\"  They were both blowing my mind!  Cut to the 2 sweet crepes: Bananas Foster and Perfect Combination.  The Bananas Foster ruled HANDS DOWN!  God I wanted to lick that plate.  But on to better things:  THE MIMOSA TRIO SAMPLER!!!  We EACH got a sampler, so yes, 12 mimosas were on our table.  I ordered the orange (yes I stay true to the original, thank you very much), white peach and passion fruit.  When you order the passion fruit they provide a little spoon for you to mix the drink with.  There are also several other flavors to choose from as well.  I thought that the white peach and passion fruit were too sweet, but the orange?  JUST RIGHT.  And DON'T call me boring because the orange was my favorite.  I just appreciate the classics, that's all.  They're in pretty small glasses, so....yes, I ordered another sampler.  What?  Don't judge.  But when I ordered the second sampler, Mike, who I believe is the owner and totally AWESOME in every way, gave me the rest of the champagne that was left and told me to go to town.

It is comprised of three small glasses of any kinds you choose. I had the orange, blood orange, and passion fruit. The passion fruit was definitely my favorite.  My husband had a glass of the white peach mimosa which was also very tasty. \nWe ordered the \"Sunday Morning\" breakfast crepe and added mushrooms to it.  It was a good size and delicious.  For our savory crepe, we had \"The Avalon,\" which was filled with pears, goat cheese, candied walnuts and honey.  It was also delicious. \n\nOur experience at Crepe Expectations was great.  It is a great place to have a nice, relaxing breakfast, brunch or lunch.  It is also a plus that they serve wine, beer and mimosas, which makes it perfect for brunch!  The prices are very reasonable and the quality of the food is great.  The next time we go we are going to try a savory crepe and another sweet crepe.

Good thing we stayed, upon closer inspection the prices were quite reasonable.\n\nMy husband orderd the greek crepe which came with either his choice of soup or salad and I ordered the special which was bbq pulled pork with with a side of apple and blue cheese coleslaw. I have lived in Texas and I do love me some slow cooked meat but I am not a fan of bbq sauce. No problem they were more than happy to put it on the side. My husband's crepe was huge, the veggies inside were very fresh and maintained a bit of their crispness. He loved it and said it filled him up, which believe me is no easy feat. My crepe was delicious also, the pulled pork truly did rival what you would find at a good bbq in Texas. The slaw which had intrigued me enough to order the dish did not disappoint. I could have eaten a plate of that by itself.\n\nOne of the best things was the free flavored waters they had. Cucumber or lemon. I don't know if they change out the flavorings but I love flavored water and the fact that it was free made the place even more affordable. The place was small and had televisions on Food Network with the sound either very low or off.

As you enter, you are greeted by chalkboards announcing beverages of all kinds - both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, from the usual to the unique. For example, if you're  a cream soda or root beer fan, don't miss ZeiberFizz, a combination of creamy soda and mild root beer flavor. Chimay for cheaper than they sell it at the bars in my hometown was quite attractive as well. As a mimosa fan, I should also note they have five flavors of mimosas, and for the indecisive, a mimosa trio sampler for $10.\n\nOf course, you don't come here for the beverages, you come here for the crepes. Ahhh the crepes. Divided into an organization freak's dream, with categories for sweet, savory, or breakfast. Being that we were going out for the first meal of our day, we tried the Crepelet, the Sunday Morning, and the Berry Bliss. As strawberries aren't currently in season, I didn't mind that the strawberries were average, because everything else was absolutely amazing. You can watch the crepes being made on closed circuit television just above the ordering station. Everyone who knows crepes knows that if you can't see the pan through the dough, the crepe is too thick. The good news here is that the lady making the crepes has it down to a science, and fans the rake as if she is working on a piece of art. Crepes are, of course, art to the food world, and Crepe Expectations is equivalent to the Met in my foodie mind's eye. This experience was the first for my husband, who had never had crepes before. Halfway through the meal, he declared that we need to make these at home, so I see a visit to Williams-Sonoma in our future.

Don't worry though, they make sure every guest gets a table, no work required on your part.\n\nTheir crepes are packed full of top quality ingredients, actually bursting might be a better way to say it,  Normally when I think of crepes, I think of something much smaller.  These are more like the size of a burrito.  Being the unapologetic carnivore that I am, I ordered the Sonora, which comes packed with carne asada steak, roasted tomato salsa, guac, & jack cheese that came with a cup of fideo soup.  The steak was tender & flavorful, and most importantly NOT overcooked with a generous portion equally distributed throughout.  Boyfriend opted for the Ana Bananas Foster, which is just like it sounds with powdered sugar on top and whip cream on the side.\n\nWe visited on a Sunday morning, and it was totally hopping.  Despite the rush they sat us down immediately, and served up our bottle of champagne pretty quickly.  Due to the high demand and only 2 crepe chefs, it took a little while to get our order.  But we were happy chillaxing with our champagne together.  Plus the have live crepe cameras, so you can watch them cooking up the yum.  This really gave me an appreciation for the fact that they're cooking each order totally fresh and just for you.\n\nSuper bonus points for self serve fresh cucumber and lemon waters.  So simple, yet refreshing and luxurious.  They also offer some custom sodas for order.

So what did I do?  I fired up Siri on my iPhone and asked it where I can eat something good for breakfast as we strolled through Henderson.  Crepe Expectations topped the recommended food restaurants with its massive amounts of positive reviews so we said screw it, lets try this place out.\n\nUpon driving up, the store looks pretty timid and small - but was quite busy and thriving on the patio so it was pretty inviting.  When you walk through the door it reminds you of a very classy bar type of atmosphere with most of the tables packed with couples and families, and overall just a great atmosphere.\n\nWhen walking up to the counter the owner, Lou, was smiling ear to ear.

It was just so refreshing to see someone that stoked about what they do and how they run their business- you don't see that too often around my neck of the woods unfortunately. \n\nAnyway, my wife and I ordered the Sunday Morning plates and my friends ordered some other Crepe's that I do not recall.

I was not expecting an \"order at the counter and then we'll bring it to you\" style, but that wasn't much of a problem.\n\nThere is an employee who kind of patrols the ordering line, asking people how many are in their party and then getting them a table. They don't take your order until you have a table to sit at.  Here lies the problem. There is ONE THING I do not like about this place: it isn't big enough. So, when it's crowded, it can be a bit stressful and an awkward wait because of how small the dining area is. We were initially seated at a small table right in the middle of the ordering line, and I didn't like it at all. I do not like it when people are standing over me while I'm eating or trying to enjoy a nice conversation/drinks/good company. But, when I asked if we could have another table, the employee happily said \"No problem, it will just be a few minutes.\" So, we got a taller bar-stool table on the side. \n\nWhen our table was ready, we ordered. The man taking orders seemed to be either the owner of the head honcho of sorts. He was very friendly and happy to make recommendations. I ordered the Rosarito (chorizo, guacamole, jack cheese, eggs) and my girlfriend ordered the Perfect Combination (strawberries, chocolate, whipped cream, powdered sugar). \n\nI also ordered the Mimosa trio sampler. First of all, they have a chalkboard full of various mimosa flavors (mango, blood orange, orange, passion fruit, white peach, strawberry, raspberry, etc.) and you could pick THREE of them for $10. And these \"sampler\" size cups were not small. I thought they were the same size as any mimosa I'd order at any other brunch place. I chose blood orange, raspberry and passion fruit. The passion fruit and blood orange were my favorite!\n\nThe food took a bit to come out, which is slightly surprising because it's CREPES, but I didn't mind the wait because the decor is wonderful and I had amazing company and drinks to keep me busy. \n\nOnce our food came, I was surprised at how huge they were. I couldn't finish mine, but wow it was delicious! I have never had a better crepe in my life. My girlfriend loved hers and she also said it was the best she had ever had. The crepes aren't too thin but aren't too thick or overwhelmingly sweet. I couldn't get over how delicious and perfect everything was cooked. \n\nSo, EVEN THOUGH I think they were a bit unorganized (they need more space or a better organization of tables inside) and slightly slow with service, I CANNOT give less than 5 stars because of how delicious the food and drinks were (and cheap! $7-8 for a LARGE crepe!).

It has been a bit since I have been willing to give an establishment 5 stars after only one experience, but my initial visit to Cr\u00eape Expectations was simply all around perfection. \n\nI met a friend for brunch on a Sunday at 11 am. The place was packed, with a line of people waiting to order and be seated. For a minute I contemplated leaving and finding a less busy place to eat, but we had been talking about trying the crepes (and mimosas!!) here for too long to do that... Besides, that may people willing to wait was almost sure to be a indicator that good things were to come to us if we exercised a little patience. \n\nThe line moved surprisingly quick, we were seated at the 'bar' in front of the crepe making stations about 20 minutes after arrival. The bar is a prime spot to sit.. You get to watch every crepe get made. Based on what we saw, I already know what I will be ordering the next 2-3 times I go in. \n\nWe started out our meal with some of the self-serve cucumber water (love that there is an option other then lemon!) and a mimosa trio. We tried the raspberry (ok), the blood orange (delicious) and my favorite, the nectar of the gods, aka the white peach. I have no idea what kind of bubbly is used at Cr\u00eape Expectations, and I do not claim to be an expert on champagne either...  but these mimosas were some of the tastiest I have ever had. \n\nOn to the grub!! I had the Sunday Morning with bacon added. This crepe slaughters every breakfast burrito I have ever had with regard to taste. It was amazing, the only thing it was lacking was a little salsa, but it was still excellent without it. Since we were debating between sweet and not sweet crepes, my friend and I also split the Berry Delight. Strawberries, blueberries and blackberries, all super juicy and fresh... with just the right amount of whipped cream. \n\nHonestly the ONLY thing I can say about Cr\u00eape Expectations that isn't positive is that it's on the small side. With food and service this good, I think they could easily fill an area double, maybe even triple the current size. Regardless, even knowing there may be a wait, I'll be back.

Full of flavor, it had a very fresh taste as though it was all organic food, no preservatives.  I don't know if this was the case but it sure tasted that way.

When I said that, the owner responded with, \"Yeah, like a burrito, but better\" and I totally agree. The meat and guacamole were well seasoned and the meat was still very tender. The Caprese was also very good, I loved the pesto! The Clucker was filled with chicken, chorizo, and some cheese and it was super flavorful.

I think in the future I'll get the Monterey and add potatoes, that will probably be the perfect crepe.\n\nThe William Tell was fantastic, basically a nice apple pie crepe.  Again, it was enormous, so we didn't finish it.  I loved the caramel and powdered sugar on top.  \n\nAfter we arrived and ordered, the place got crowded.  Every seat taken and a line out the door.

Its in a center with a lot of other restaurants.  Its a small location with probably 10 or so tables with a couple more outside.  The place was packed when we got there and this is where the process is a bit weird.  You need to check in with the cashier to put in your name down.  This is the same place you order as well but not until a table is ready.  Sort of a hybrid of the order and pay with open seating and the more traditional sit and then order from a server. Even though there are no servers  the staff roams the floor looking to help where possible.  The only part I didn't like is that waiting for tables is done in the hallway toward the back.  Not much can be done with that though because the place is pretty small.\n\nAs for ambiance the location is cozy and has low lighting even during the day.  The crepe stations are up front and open so you can watch the chefs work their magic.  They've even got overhead camera view above so you can watch from the tables.  There are also 2 TVs on the walls which were showing football today which was a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe service was friendly both at the cashier and the staff walking around.  The iced tea cups were pretty small which is always a disappointment for me because I drink a lot during the meal.  Fortunately the staff member that brought the tea must have sensed my mood because not only did he ask if we usually drink a lot of tea, when we replied yes he brought a full pitcher and left it at the table just for us. Even better there was plenty of ice in the pitcher so no concern of tea melting the ice in my glass (another pet peeve).\n\nOn to the food.  I went breakfast with the rosarito which has chorizo, scrambled eggs, jack cheese and guacamole.  It was quite tasty.  Only thing missing was a bit of salsa on top (maybe some sour cream too).  Also came with either bananas or cottage cheese on the side.  I went with sliced bananas which were a good compliment to the savory crepe.  My wife had the little Italy which was pepperoni, mozzarella, and tomatoes basil sauce.  It was like a pizza in a crepe (thankfully she let me try it as I'll probably get that when I want lunch.) Her crepe came with fidejo soup which was like chicken noodle minis the chicken chunks.  Very good.\n\nWe couldn't be pass up a chance for a dessert crepe so we split the monkey which has Nutella, bananas, chocolate, whip cream and we added strawberries.   This was definitely my favorite of the three. \n\nThe portions are quite large so we couldn't eat everything. Probably could have split one savory and then the sweet. The crepes were all delicious and it was cool to watch the chefs make them to order too.  \n\nTo round out the experience both the wait staff and the cashier thanked us for coming in and made sure to ask for us to come back soon.  The only reason I didn't do 5 stars was the somewhat awkward waiting in the narrow hallway.  I'm not sure there is much they can do about it though and it will definitely  not deter me from coming back again.\n\nThanks for the great meal.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I lived in Vegas when this restaurant opened and went many, many times.

However, the crepe has an interesting texture, where the pores will absorb all the juices and when you eat the crepe you can taste all the flavor at once.

Meat was very tender and the meal did come with a side salad with balsamic vinaigrette dressing.\n\nSweet Crepe\nI also go their sweet crepe to taste, and I was more impressed with their sweet crepe then their  savory crepe. The Ana banana foster, crepe had carmely sweet sauced drenched on top and with in the crepe that was full of bananas. They gave whipped creme to go on top.

It looks like they just opened. First of all, I am a crepe fan, and I honestly think they can do better. I came with that expectation because food at restaurants isn't always satisfactory, and I've stopped going out for a long time.  I ordered a Veggie Delight (I'm a vegetarian/vegan), and it had baby spinach, red onion, tomatoes and feta cheese, and it wasn't fully wrapped and there was too much feta cheese. I like a crepe where everything's stuffed in-nothing spilled out on the ends. I liked their simple selection of ingredients-I would have liked to see more vegetarian options. They do have the \"create your own crepe\" option, but I wasn't in the right mood to invent my own crepe. It costs $3.50 for a crepe with 1 topping and for every meat you add, it's 1.00 and savory & cheese for .75. If I really made the effort to design my own crepe, I would have ordered spinach and swiss, and it would have been slightly cheaper than the Veggie Delight (it cost $5.25) for less ingredients.\n\nIf I could come here again, I would try the breakfast crepe and sweet crepe when I need my sweet fix. And maybe that'll change my rating. :)\n\nI like the design and decor of the cafe-a nice mixture homey 'n' modern feel to it-loove the wooden fans.

We talked about going there for quite awhile since it's just around the corner from where we live. Finally, last Saturday, after an early jaunt to the dog park, the boy and I decided to have a nice little brunch date. The place was fairly empty and we were surprised to find it was full table service. We were prepared to order at the counter and then sit. The decor was really cute and the atmosphere was really nice. The waitress was a little bit abrasive, and not my favorite, but we ordered lattes and a couple of sweet crepes, read the Ahwatukee Foothills News and just enjoyed some pleasant conversation. We both went with sweet crepes, the Strawberry, Nutella and Whipped Cream. I've never been to France and I've not traveled the world over so I'm not going to tell you about how inferior their crepes are to those I've enjoyed in Paris, so I think they were good. I guess they're a little on the thick side, from what I've heard about crepes, but it created a good balance with how much filling they put in them. This past Saturday we had friends stay over and they wanted to go as well, so we went again for the second Saturday in a row. This week there was apparently some sort of Senior Olympics, so 90% of the tables were pushed together for them, fine whatever. So we were sat and brought menus, and not two seconds after the first waitress walked away, the same woman as the last time came over and said \"are you ready to order?\". I felt kind of rude but she was so I guess no harm, no foul, but I just said \"She literally JUST brought us the menus\". So she went away for 30 seconds and was back. Then we ordered coffee, 1 min later she was back with the coffee and very clearly ready for our order. We were half way through giving our order when this group of 3 other diners who were apparently regulars and favorites of the waitress felt that they should interject and begin joking about the waitress not already knowing their order, she of course obliged, and eventually returned to taking our order. We ordered a breakfast crepe each and then two sweet crepes to share. She informed us that she was just going to bring them all out together because that other large group was going to be ordering too. It was obvious what they were trying to do was squeeze us in really quick before the large group of senior bicyclists weeded their kitchen for 20 mins. That's cool, I get it, but it could have been done a bit more gracefully. I had the Ham, Egg and Pepper Jack cheese crepe, which was really good. The ham seemed to be really good quality. One saving grace of the waitress was that she had the forethought to put the whipped cream on the side of the sweet crepes so that it wasn't a melted mess by the time we were ready to eat them. Everything was tasty yet again, but I still think their service could use some work, or maybe I just need to work on being \"a chosen one\". We'll probably go back once in a while, we'll just try to avoid senior bike race day from now on.

I didn't realize how many fro-yo junkies were out there waiting, hoping and wishing they would open their newest location! \n\nTonight being there first night I have to tip my hat to Dave and family. They have managed to put out as good of a product as they have over at the North Scottsdale location. I had the twangy yogurt topped with Fruity Pebbles and mochi.. you know for me its all about textures and flavors. Something about the sweet tart yogurt up against the crunch of the pebbles and the soft chewiness of the mochi that just gets me going. \n\nIce Tango is truly a delight and I'm just so excited that they are only about a mile or so from the house.

It was a beautiful summer, where I lived only a little ways from LA and subsequently, from Yogurt Passion, which, if you ever get the chance to visit, is AMAZING. Thus, when I came to the realization that there were hardly any yogurt places here, I went through a period of depression....until....I did a yelp search and found Ice Tango!!! It was just as I could have possibly imagined anything that I could find in LA!! However, most of my opinions are comparing Ice Tango to the almighty Yogurt Passion...so pardon me if I'm not falling head-over-heels in love with this place.\n\nPros:\n-best plain yogurt flavor (Twangy tart) I've ever tried. There's this mysterious sweet, somewhat fruity flavor to it that I'm a little obsessed with. I've never been a fan of plain, but I guess now I am.\n-The peach flavor is also very good too, if you want a flavor recommendation.\n-All the fruit is fresh and tastes amazing.\n-If you sign up for their \"fan club\" online, you get emails with coupons.\n\nCons:\n-This is damn pricey yogurt. When I went to Yogurt Passion, I could pile up the biggest size cup with maybe 10oz of yogurt and 4 different types of fruit and it would ring up to be around $5. I come here and I can't even get toppings without paying and extra $0.75 for each and even with a cup of just yogurt, it costs more than $5. If they priced the same way as Yogurt Passion (and a ton of other LA yogurt chains) by the ounce, I would've said that Ice Tango was the best yogurt place I've been to in my life. Sadly, my wallet isn't big enough my college-student money on topping-less yogurt on a regular basis.\n-Passion fruit is gross! Don't get it no matter what you do! It will be the regret of your life, to exaggerate. It tastes...a little muddy. I would say that's a bad thing.\n- Those new fruitty sparklers? Yeah, I wouldn't recommend them, at least after trying the coconut lime. I'll give them another try in the near future, but until then, it's a thumbs down.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 0, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I really like this place.

Good, yes.  And in a good location.  And clean and the staff was nice.  But when I'm looking for dessert, \"twangy tart\" simply cant stand up to any kind of chocolate, which they had none of, at least in the frozen yogurt genre.  \n\nHowever, fresh, creative toppings and not TOO overly priced, especially for this McDonald and Scottsdale Rd location...I'll go again when I'm looking for something a little more healthy and a little less amazing.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Very fun!
