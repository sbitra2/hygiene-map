Crave is excellent for what it is - a mish mash of hookah, cheap drinks, and good food specials. It's a great spot to pre drink without dropping a hundred bucks if you're with those annoying friends who feel like they need to go out before 11. \n\nThe food specials are solid as well. As Sunny mentioned, five bucks can get you anything from a hummus plate to a quesadilla to a solid sandwich combo. Throw in a couple $2 beers or mixed drink and you've got yourself an excellent post work wind down. \n\nThe music selection does get pretty gangsta on the weekends, but if you are just looking to avoid the long lines at Cue or Zuma, and want a cheap drink while you're doing it, Crave is the place to be. \n\nOn a side note, I've never lost my card or witnessed anyone puking.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Good times.

Now im white also but I lived with a mexican family for 6 years so I know what REAL mexican food is and that  is what I expect when I go to a mexican restaurant,That didnt happen here and I will never go back here.....to eat that is!  so if you like totally Americanized mexican restaurants you may like the sandbar but if you actually know what real mexican food looks and tastes like your going to be very very disappointed with this place!", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Kelley is Awesome.

I'm usually game for anything, but, I didn't know just how NOT cool it was going to be. \n\nWe arrived at the restaurant, and, as Michael C noted in his review....it is  a100% geriatric establishment.   The inside is about as exciting as the Salvation Army down the street.  It's horrible . But you see.....therein lies the stark dichotomy:  old people LOVE this place.   Allow me to explain: \n\nUpon arrival, the lounge singer \"Jimmie\" greeted us.  The g/f's  grandparents go to this place every Friday night, apparently.   Old people LOVE going to a place only to be acknowledged.  Period.  My parents love that.    They feel really special.   Well......when Jimmie the lounge singer says hello, gives a wink, etc.--people dig it.  Doesn't matter what the place looks like or what the food looks like.......they like the PREDICTABILITY of it all.  No surprises here fellow Yelpers. \n\nSo we sit down for dinner -- and order drinks.   The wine tasted as though it had been filtered through a sweaty gym sock.  No joke.  Later found out it was Vendage (i.e. \"box\" wine).  I couldn't drink it.  And I like Two Buck Chuck!\n\nWe sat for two hours watching the 60+ crowd get their groove on.  And.....for that reason, I say, keep this place going!!!!   Old people dig it!  The lounge singer was 100% geriatric, but the songs he sang brought the folks back to the \"good old days!\"  And they seemed happy !   Live and let live is what I say.........\n\nThe food--about as good as an old shoe.  Absolutely 100% old people food.  Tasted like eating in the retirement home.    But the old people LOVE IT.  Wow. \n\nYou wouldn't believe it, but ended up going BACK to this place the next morning for the $4 breakfast special.   It wasn't as bad this time around -- not sure if I was starting to blend into the Scottsdale geriatric retiree community and just giving up......but .....it wasn't too bad without the lounge singer....(sorry Jimmie-- your version of \"Moon River\" is just not my preference).  \n\nIf you're 70 and over (which, doubtful you're here on Yelp) -- this is your 5 star place.
