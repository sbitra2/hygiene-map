It's one of those restaurants that has nice decorations and a romantic feel to it -- like an expensive restaurant would -- but still manages to price its entrees between $8-16. This place is definitely not a hole-in-the-wall -- it's pretty, with nice art on the walls.\nFor starters, my husband ordered the chicken curry pastry puffs, which were really good, he said.\nFor entrees, I decided to try something called \"samosas and Ba-Yar Gyaw Soup,\" which is a tasty thick yellow bean soup with cabbage, onion, potato and tamarind juice. It's presented with broken up pieces of samosa and Ba-Yar-Gyaw (dried split peas crushed and deep fried). It was $8 and it was SO AWESOME. If I could have this for lunch everyday, I would. The owner told us that particular soup is really popular among the women who come in for their lunch breaks.\n\nMy husband, meanwhile, ordered the coconut milk chicken curry, which he loved. He said it had high-quality ingredients, and the taste was more subtle than a Thai or Indian curry would be.\nFor dessert, I ordered Burmese semolina cake, which was nice, but heavy. \nHe ordered Falooda, which is this funky rose-flavored milk, icecream, tapioca, bread pudding and jello strips all mixed into a sundae dish (It's quite the acquired taste -- although I like it).\nThroughout dinner, the owner was very friendly about discussing Burmese cooking, etc. The waitresses were friendly, too.\nI really hope this place makes it -- it's tucked in the same complex as a Claim Jumper, Tapino and Radda wine bars and Sushi on Shea, so it has a lot of competition for diners.

It was the less-than warm reception to the questions I had asked- a perception I haven't had in a VERY long time (all the venues I've been to for many months, a few years, even, have been quite accomodating), and the long wait times I encountered affected the tone of this review.  \n---\nI've had this \"Taste of Phoenix\" giftcard (purchased through Costco) good at restaurants such as Tapino, Picazzo Gourmet Pizza, Medizona, and Little Rangoon since pre-Christmas, so I decided to go for my first LRvisit last Friday.  Alfred, who I later found out is one of the venue's two owners (found a business card w/ his name on it), showed me to one of the corner tables (there were two occupied tables indoors and a full table outdoors).  \n\nAfter food allergy issues were covered, I ordered the two items I spotted on the online menu beforehand- Chicken satay app and Dhal curry.  I was starving and was thankful for the complimentary fried wontons and questionary dipping sauce.  It looked somewhat akin to Chinese duck sauce and was sure to contain allergenic ingredients (Alfred didn't check on the info).  Though I was almost starving, I had to ask Alfred to take the plate away, even though 2/3 of the wonton chips remained.  Thankfully, the two menu items I ordered almost arrived simultaneously, albeit after what I thought was a long wait for an app dish and soup (15 minutes for homemade soup I can understand, but 15 minutes for an appetizer of four 4\"x1\" skewers of grilled chicken skewers?).  Though it wasn't as dark in the restaurant as my photos would lead you to believe, the somewhat fatty satay skewers didn't have that gorgeous caramelization I'm used to seeing in other venues and as such did not strike me as \"grilled to perfection\" as stated on the menu.  The serving temperature of the skewers also seemed closer to room temperature than straight from the grill, but at least I was able to eat these right away since the Dhal curry was so hot, I had to let it cool for at least ten minutes.  The paratha that accompanied the curry was nicely plump and flaky when it first arrived, and, fortunate for me, I tore a piece and tried it with the too-hot curry then and so was able to enjoy its flakiness.  After devouring the slightly luke-warm satay skewers, which were very good when paired with the DELICIOUS peanut sauce (although I found it visually off-putting), I turned my attention to the curry soup, which was still very hot, but was so tasty that I decided to plow ahead (an almost visual truth since I was hungry!).  The split pea and lentil soup was a satisfying meal, yet I was expecting a more viscous consistency, closer to hummus, although I cannot fathom why, since dhal/daal curries of Indian cuisine are also on the watery side (at least Pasand's and Udupi Cafe's were, as I recall).  The cooled paratha was disappointing at this point since the flakiness was almost nonexistent, and the bread's texture was now almost pasty.  Should I order the dhal curry dish again, I'll have to ask that the paratha be brought out after the soup's cooled for a few minutes.\n\nI hope to visit soon for lunch where I hope I'll be able to give a higher rating.  In the meantime, please enjoy the pics I've included!  :)  Be warned- it took at least fifteen minutes for my check to arrive, despite the fact there were only three or four tables occupied at any given time (around ten people or under that).  Thought I'd also mention that while the take-out menu only indicated two dessert items (Sanwin Makin and Mango-coconut pudding), the server did show me a menu with many intriguing gelato desserts ranging from $3 scoops to $5-$8 sundaes and other creations!  Since I had the impression that Alfred didn't appreciate the food allergy questions I posed to him earlier, I wasn't in the mood to go into more detail with the gelatos' ingredients.

We stayed away from the menu items that are obviously there to satisfy the less adventurous and aimed at what we thought were the more traditional Burmese dishes. Our meal started with us sharing the Green Tea Salad - which to this day, even after eating this awesome dish dozens of times, is still a favorite. The marinated green tea, crunchy garlic slices, crunchy yellow peas, peanuts, and smoked dried shrimp are all hand carried by friends and family out of Burma. These are added to thin sliced cabbage, tomato, some lemon, oil, and - if you request it, boiled egg. So while this dish may appear pricey, considering its origins and the rarity of these ingredients in the United States, we are quite lucky to be able to sample this delicacy. Try Green Tea Salad with a side of rice for a complete meal.\n\nMy wife asked for the Spinach and Marinated Bamboo Shoots for her entree and was asked if she knew if that was what she really wanted as this is typically an acquired taste. The smell of the marinated bamboo shoots is not for everyone, but my wife is never one to shy away from a food challenge, she loved it and has ordered it a couple of times since then. I ordered the Pork Belly Curry served in a homemade tomato based savory curry I have enjoyed ever since (this curry is used as a base for many of the curry dishes). For dessert it was our lucky day as Elizabeth, the owner, had made her and her workers a special Sanwin Makin or semolina cake with durian (normally it is made with raisins) - delicious, but an acquired taste for us Americans. This must be the easiest way to try durian for the first time as its notorious smell is hard to detect in the cake, not that this was our first time experiencing this pungent king of fruits.\n\nOn subsequent visits we have been treated to most every Burmese dish on the menu, including a number of items not on the menu. One of my personal favorites which they have on offer from time to time is the Butternut Squash and Fish Curry. Another favorite but not for the weak of palate due to its astronomic spice levels is a simple preparation of sliced onion with salt, oil, lemon, and enough roasted chilie flakes to camouflage the onions. It sounds simple but the combination comes together to deliver something awesome - this spicy onion salad is more typically a food eaten by rural Burmese. The Pig Ear Salad (not on the menu) was challenging but we were both thrilled at the opportunity to try it. \n\nSomething you must try is the Tobu Salad, and no, this is not a spelling mistake, I did not mean tofu. Tobu is a yellow split pea based kind of tofu that is sliced and mixed into a large salad which is one of my wife's and my favorite dishes here. She also loves the Moh Hinga. This soup is one of the most traditional of all Burmese dishes. Moh Hinga is made of cat fish and rice noodles, garnished with cilantro, and on request served with sides of lemon juice, chili flakes, boiled egg, and crunchy yellow peas which you can mix into the soup to your own taste. There are many more authentic Burmese dishes on the menu but if you only try what might already be familiar to you, you will not have mustered the courage to try something new and wonderful.\n\nLittle Rangoon, like nearly all restaurants in the Phoenix / Scottsdale area this year finds themselves at times in the doldrums waiting for a customer but they are surviving so if you find the restaurant devoid of diners don't let that disuade you from dipping your toe into the Taste of Burma.

The food really is quite good, with a handful of intriguing dishes, and worth the trip.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "invited by some friends with a 25 dollar off coupon, and since we love ethnic experiences, wanted to try this place out. \n\ni don't know what's wrong with my palate lately, but i keep trying these new places that i'm not chomping at the bit or dreaming about for days afterwards. my girlfriend tells me it's because i've crossed into the \"mid-late 30's\" and that my taste buds are just getting old....because i haven't given a 5 star recently, and i'm starting to get down on myself.\nbut i wasn't that impressed with my dish. i ordered the buddha dish and it was just standard asian style veggies with 2 chunks of tofu...bok choy, carrots, peas, those cute littel corns, and a light syrupy sauce. tasted just like any other chinese food i've ever had. and the dessert..semolina cake....was also just ok, not \"whoa, this is delicious...i have to lick the plate\" but simply ok. \nwe did get a toda salad which was good, and alot of the curry dishes smelled and looked tasty, so if we go back, we'll have to try those....\nbut now that we'ver read \"Eat This, Not That\" restaurant edition....damn man, you can't eat anything in restaurant anymore without feeling guilty. i wish i'd never read that book...boo hoo. \n\nso to sum up, if you get something, go for hearty...a curry or meat dish, they may be better than what we got. and get dessert somewhere else. oh....our waitress said the family style plates we were ordereing were big enough for two people, but i didn't think they were (and i'm little....only 145 and i ate my whole plate plus dessert). \n\nexcellent staff...very friendly. we spent about 25 bucks each there.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Popped in for a late lunch Saturday. \n\nI like almost everything about this place, except possibly the location, which prevents most of us from finding it.

Delish.  I won't write a whole review as I've only been once and had a lunch special.  The menu seems to be very pan-Asian influenced, with bold flavors.  If you like heat, ask for the side chile sauces, which you can mix in and increase to your desired level of pow.  The owners were incredibly nice and I'm afraid their lease is up, so it remains to be seen if they stay put.  If you like Asian food, give them some business... I think it would be a great place to take friends and share a bunch of dishes.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Closed.
