If I see them, I must have them. There's a funny thing about cinnamon rolls though, they're not all good... Weird right? \n\nFinding the best cinnamon rolls takes time and perseverance. It's not an easy task, but someone has to do it, and I will sacrifice my waist line for you in order to find excellent rolls of cinn. \n\n The cinnamon rolls at White Cup Coffee are made in-house. This, of course, is mandatory to be considered for the upper echelon level of cinnamon roll greatness.  \n\nI ordered mine to-go. When the moment finally came to eat it, there was some slight disappointment. The cinnamon roll had to be heated before eated... \n\nSometimes, but rarely, a cinnamon roll can be eaten cold. However, in my experience, it's best to have them warm and soft to the touch. It seemed that for now, I'd have to wait...\n\nTonight I popped that bad boy in the microwave (unfortunate it came to that). It was very good though. The icing was of the cream cheese variety (my fave). The roll itself wasn't as gooey as I like, but it's tough to judge after it's been sitting around all day. \n\nOverall, I'd call the White Cup cinnamon roll a success. Of course... I will have to do more research. Another visit will be required to know for sure. And then maybe another visit, just to be Really sure. \n\nOh... I forgot to mention... they had coffee.

I still can't decide... \n\nAfter we ordered Walter came by and introduced himself.  I found out a few days later he is one of the owners.   \n\nI have to say I was put off by several of the things he was telling us.  \n\n1. They haven't started advertising.\n\nExplains the customer situation - almost a month after opening.\n\n2. They are getting rid of the Spanish wines in favor of California wines.  \n\nI asked \" Are you trying to make the wine more approachable?\" to which he fumbled a halfhearted yes.  My instinct is that maybe Walter does not like or understand Spanish wine and does like California wine.  Maybe it is just me... but if you take away the second most important thing about a Tapas bar - the Spanish wine - you can't expect to survive as a Spanish Tapas Bar for very long.  I suggested he add a few more Cava to the menu - I don't think my suggestion went far based on his lack of enthusiasm as the conversation shifted to: \n\n3. They are changing the menu and removing some of the Tapas and adding Paella.  \n\nNow... I LOVE Paella.  Between my friends and I we have two or three 36-48 inch Paella pans with the grills to cooks them with and a half dozen of the smaller Paella pans. Walter was kind enough to wait while I searched for an old picture of me cooking a 48 inch Paella - so it was off putting when Walter asked me what my favorite Paella was and I told him rabbit and he stood there with his mouth agape.  He said they were going to have vegetable, chicken or seafood Paella. Ok.  \n\nJust a suggestion but has to be REALLY good - because mediocre Paella is horrible.  Not that it can't work or be a great addition, but had better be really, really good.\n\nNow to the food:  We ordered the Shrimp, the Steak, the Jamon and Cheese tray and a glass of the one and only Cava.  \n\nThe Cava was good, ok quality = B-\n\nThe Jamon and Cheese tray - had some lovely dates, Jamon was nice but cold like it just came out of the refrigerator instead of being hand sliced at room temp.  The Cheese was ok and the Marcona almonds were fine = C\n\nThe Steak arrived on a regular plate - not the traditional Tapas clay dish.  The steak was thin, of poor quality, overcooked and luke-warm.  The plate was cold and hence why the steak was not hot.  The steak didn't have the cumin like at the old Lola's - instead it came with a blue cheese crumble on top, needed salt and pepper = D\n\nThe Shrimp also arrived on a regular plate that wasn't heated.  The first few were great, reminiscent of the old Lola's flavor and pizzazz.  Then, because the plate was so cold the shrimp cooled quickly and lost their pizzazz.  Started out as an A and quickly cooled/congealed to a C\n\nI sat there basking in the romantic wine soaked memories of the old Lola's - all of the chaotic energy, bumping into people, yelling over the music, laughing, spilling wine on someone and buying them a new glass as an apology, reaching for that last olive, anxiously waiving down the rushing waiters furiously trying to keep up with the second or fourth round of orders of the shrimp and wine, striking up conversation with the people next to you...  With this excellent space, all of the new coffee equipment, all of the frenetic energy of the Yard Lola's Tapas should be a huge hit.  I sat there willing it to be better, to match the quality of the space, the quality of the coffee equipment the quality of my memories.\n\nI truly hope they don't get rid of the Spanish wine or Tapas.  I hope that they go full Spanish traditional with the clay tapas pots piping hot (just a suggestion).  I hope they add more Tapas like the Croquets con Papas y Jamon, Roast Suckling Pig, Spanish honey with Manchego or Mussels with Cava and Chorizo, Fideos with Chorizo.  I hope they add more Cava, and/or more... dare I say it... Spanish wine.\n\nWe will give the time.  The Lola's of old deserves the chance to be reborn in this amazing space.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I am SO glad these guys are back in all their glory.

The word palatable or delicious would only be used to describe the herbed potatoes (come with the omelets) if a gun was put to my head. In fairness, not much you can do with potatoes if you choose to serve them. But that's the point, don't come here for a delicious breakfast.  Some people \"do breakfast\" and don't really focus on decor or ambiance; this place is about the latter, not the former. \n\nLola apparently also just opened as the cashier and cook both responded to questions with \"I'm new here.\"  Why would I be talking to the cook at a restaurant you're thinking? Well, I was given a number tab by the cashier which would ordinarily cause one to believe his or her food/drink/order would be brought to him or her. Nope. After about 5 minutes the cashier brings me my latte and says, \"It's been ready for pick up at the counter.\" As I look at the tab I think, \"Why did you give me this then? \" A few minutes later, the cook yells out, \"Number 2 is ready.\" That's my cue I guess. The tab was apparently in case I forgot my number. When I asked the cook for a knife and fork to eat the food is when he explains \"He's New\" and has no clue. The cashier points me to the plastic knives and forks on the counter.

The only thing giving this a 1 star is the decor and the manager that I will talk about later in my review.\n\n\nDefinitely Not a fan of the girl working on 5/24 at 11 being a bit to touchy feely with my boyfriend sitting next to me and calling him baby and sweetheart all night(in which he knew and plenty of other people I told about her actions knew why I would be livid). That is the reason for the 1 star mostly along with the burnt slider she probably told the chefs to burn on purpose. The fact I have to get up and help myself to my own water since she failed to ask me at one point after I finished my first glass of water if I needed anything else or different. The manager (I think) helped me more than she did and directed me to where I needed to go; since she is obviously a horrid customer service employee not noticing that if I empty out of glass and not ask if I needed anything further is a tad annoying. Asking once if I need anything isn't enough if you are a server/waiter/bartender.  But apparently in her eyes it's okay to just care about the a girls boyfriend and pissing off girlfriends at this bar.\n\nThe sliders were not really pleasant  and i had been drinking too so you think they would be more than tolerable but good god they were so charred. Nothing I would reorder unless they didn't burn the burger so much. The bacon made the whole sliders were the only thing keeping me from not touching it completely.\n\nWill I be back? Maybe if they got rid of the bartender touchy feely lady that got me all riled up.  If she is there next time i can promise you that management will be notified at that point if she starts being her inappropriate self. I'm severely tempted to write a letter of complaint to the company if they don't read these since I have never felt so disgusted in my whole entire life going to a restaurant/bar.  Being Disrespected in the slightest is what i have no tolerance for what so ever and she crossed every possible line and worse by not even asking me at one point if  I would like one thing after I finished my first glass of water.  \n\nWhen i was going to pay for our tab and my boyfriend hurried so he could sneak in her undeserved tip and our balance she had no idea that we were even on the same tab since I apparently wasn't allowed to order anything for myself.\n\nI literally felt like this was some kind of joke like I should have been on one of those shows like Restaurant stakeout.\n\n*threatened by kindness and spunk to my boyfriend alone.

Funny enough, this Einstein is very occupied during the weekend!  A good size line and crowded tables often await us.  But no matter since the wifey needs her morning cup of Joe!  This location is a popular early destination for folks living nearby as well as those getting back on the road for the trek back to their home state.\n\nWifey is pretty basic when it comes to ordering, a cup of coffee, and a bagel (toasted) with a shmear.  Her bagel and flavor of shmear will vary by visit, but her cup of coffee is a constant.  She gets it often enough she's bought one of those refillable mugs from Einstein's, you get a nice size on it, plus it saves you in the long run on refills.  I myself am OK with the food there, I like a fresh toasted bagel with shmear, but I often go up to the menu board to get something.  Now, we all know that Einstein's does use microwaves for much of their food items because let's face it, there is no large kitchen there.  Much to my chagrin, things like their egg products and bacon and such they use gets nuked in the microwave.  So if you're looking for a fresh fried egg on your bagel (damn that sounds delicious), you're not going to find it here.  I've gotten a bagel sandwich with egg at Einstein's before and it's not usually one of my favorites.  I stick with a few things there.  For some strange reason I like their Chicken Salad deli sandwich.  To me it's yummy!  Chunks of chicken, grapes, almonds, and craisins in a vinaigrette dressing, topped with lettuce, tomato, and red onion on wheat?  Sign me up!  I like it very much, even for breakfast!  Another one of my favorites is the Thintastic Chicken Pesto bagel sandwich.  Sliced chicken breast strips, roasted tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil pesto on a thin bagel of your choice.  For not being a 100% in house made sandwich it is pretty good.  Most of their sandwiches come with a pickle, and a side of potato salad, fruit, or a bag of chips.  I opt for the potato salad most occasions because Einstein's actually makes one I like.\n\nA bit of a downer for me is the pricing.  Einstein I guess can be considered 'gourmet', their prices reflect it!  Not the cheapest for a sandwich or any of their combos.  A sandwich combo will run in the $6 range, and that doesn't include a drink!  Luckily I just bum off some coffee from the wifey.  Even a basic combo of a bagel, shmear, and a small coffee will run folks back $3.99 plus tax.  If I get this combo I guarantee you I will be left HUNGRY.  And hungry boy = grumpy boy!  Compare this to the $3 Subway breakfast combo (6 inch breakfast sandwich and drink) right next door and you can see the gap in food portion.  I will give Einstein's their due though, the bagels are A-OK.\n\nService is usually good for us, as we often get the manager to take our order.  She's attentive, and quick on her toes.  The thing that takes the longest is actually getting our order.  But that's no problem, I get to hang out with the wifey longer.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Came for lunch and there was 1 person I front of me.

However, they are nothing in comparison to the Bagel Cafe and New York bagel shops. Since there is only one bagel cafe and the New York bagel shops are nearly 3,000 miles away, my tastebuds coexist with Einstein Bagels.\n\n    Today, I stopped off at this Einstein Bagels on the way to Spring Mountains National Recreation Area. It is off the 215 Freeway along Durango Drive and just south of Centennial Hills Hospital. It was a breeze to get to.\n\n  The experience I had at this location is really no different than the other Einstein Bagels I reviewed. I walked in. I ordered and gave them my name. I walked past the display case of bagels where I paid. The cashier handed me a coffee cup before they brought me my bagel. I had the choice of few brews of coffee to fill the cup. The coffee is on a par with the coffee house chains. The way that I could tell the coffee us good is that I don't need syrup in it. The refills are unlimited. A few minutes after sitting down, I was biting into the toasted sesame bagel with salmon shmear. The bagel was 3.50 star good. That puts it on the same league as a Dunkin Donuts bagel. The coffee and bagel with salmon shmear duo came out to $5.01. Not bad! But not spectacular! My complaint about Einstein Bagels, which is the exact one that dates back to my 2012 review on this company is that they don't include a side item like a pickle or potato salad. It takes some getting used to when the New York bagel shops would include potato or macaroni salad and a pickle with the meal. Even their more $ nova lox sandwiches don't include a side. Maybe thats why Einstein Bagels only lasted around three months in the New York market.\n\n  When I returned to my car, I drove toward Durango Drive with no enthusiasm for Einstein Bagels. If Dunkin Donuts was on the right side of the road I probably would of chosen it over Einstein Brothers. My realty is that because Einstein Bagels is all Vegas really has for bagel shops with the exception of Bagel Cafe and a couple others, I will settle for 3.5 star bagels.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 6, "useful": 6, "cool": 7}}, {"text": "I will admit that I'm a little biased when it comes to my bagels because I'm from Northern NJ and New York City, but I have to admit that these are pretty darn good.

I think it was around \u00a33 for a small portion but with the two slices of home-baked bread and a really generous portion I left full and happy and not regretting the \u00a33 at all. And have a look at my uploaded photo. I know it doesn't really affect the taste of the food, but it's presented in a beautiful little bowl (with a lid!) on a slate board (which is, like, so hot right now). Classy.\n\nAnd the soup itself. Oh my and oh yes. If you're in the mood for soup, and good soup, Union of Genius should be your first port of call.\n\nThey have Artisan Roast coffee and Pekoe (I think) tea and Love Pure Cakes (an Edinburgh based baker who does gluten, wheat and dairy free cakes and has quite healthy sounding options too). \n\nI think there's also wifi too but due to lack of seats I can't imagine it'd be particularly polite to set up shop for a while.\n\nGood soup.

I saw this place & the connected sandwich shop next door to it open recently. I recognized the name of the sandwich shop, Capriotti's, because there is one up in north Scottsdale. I've never eaten there, but have driven by it numerous times. This was my first clue that the new bagel shop was probably locally owned & operated. I always prefer to spend my money at those types of places when possible. When you pull up you notice there is very little parking in the front.There is however ample parking behind the building. If you are familiar with his area, you know parking is a bit limited everywhere. I walked in the front door and was hit by a soft sweet aroma. There were large coffee carafes filled with \"Peet's Coffee & Tea\" neatly lined up along the wall. The place was well lit, organized, and seemed very clean. I walked up to the counter and was greeted by a friendly man. As expected, there was a large selection of bagels to choose from at the counter. I couldn't pick just one so I decided to go with half a dozen. They had some unique bagels on their menu such as tropical & sourdough. The man kindly offered me an extra container of cream cheese & I decided to try the light veggie one. I brought the bagels home and cut into an asiago one. I notice right away that the bagels were big & thick! They looked homemade & not like the usual generic, mass produced ones you get from Buerger's or Einstein Bros. The inside was so moist. It was almost doughy, but not underdone by any means. Impressive! I lightly toasted it and put the light plain cream cheese on it. The cream cheese was delicious. It doesn't taste like it's the light version either. If the light version is this good I wonder how good the regular cream cheese is?!? Out of curiosity I try a taste of the veggie cream cheese on its own. It's also delicious! Again, you can tell this was homemade and not made in bulk somewhere & sent out. A good balance of flavors! This is my new favorite bagel shop. I cannot wait to try the rest of the bagels I bought. Next time I want to try some of their coffee & or bagel breakfast sandwichs. There will definitely be a next time. This is such a great addition to the CenPho neighborhood!", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 10, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "I think I arrived opening day.

Very original and extremely tasty!  Staff was friendly and love that its a unique local place.  Very small space other than the seating outside.  Give it a try and bring your friends!  These types of great places need our support to keep our neighborhood special.\n\nAnother great thing about this place is that they took a sad old building, refurbished it and made it look great.

Most of the seating is outside where they have a handful of tables under a covered patio. The weather was too gorgeous for me to pass up that opportunity, so once I had my food I grabbed a seat and enjoyed the morning.\n\n**There are only 3-4 parking spots available in the front, but if you go around the right/south side of the building there is parking in the back.\n\nI had a simple request: a toasted chocolate chip bagel with reduced fat shmear. It was perfectly toasty, crunchy and flavorful, accented well by the shmear. The bagel was pretty large, so I felt that I got what I was paying for. I felt bad because when I went to pay, I realized I only had a credit a card and no cash...I felt silly paying for such a small purchase with plastic, but the cashier was totally cool about it, he just smiled and told me it happens a lot. It helped to ease my mind :)\n\nI don't live in the area, so the only reason I'm not sure I'll return is because I don't know when I will be close again, but the experience I had Saturday was very pleasant and should I get the opportunity again, I'll stop for another bagel!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "It's no surprise that the businesses around this place have lines & full parking lots, and this place has the buzz of zero interest.\n\nI woke up with a craving for a fresh bagel this morning, and decided to walk over to Everything Bagels. \n\nI walked in at 7:20 to a place with no sign of life. The display case was nearly empty, and there were very few bagels in baskets. I thought maybe they were closed. I was about to leave when an older man stepped out of the back. I asked if they were open, to which he gruffly responded, \"yes, the door was open, wasn't it\"? I was taken off guard by his rudeness, and apologized, and simply told him that it didn't seem like they were open yet. He said, \"you're fine\", as if I was the rude dumb-ass. He proceeded to lecture me on the fact that he was the only one there, and that he had many things he had to do all by himself. Here's some free advice dude --- it takes 2 seconds to make a card that says, \"In back. I'll be with you in a moment\". \n\nAt this point, all I want to do is order something, and get the hell out of there. THEN, he asks me if I want a drink. I ask him how the iced coffee is served, to which he patronizingly says, \"well, I give you a cup of ice, and you can poor the medium or dark roast over it\". When I decline, he says, \"do you mind telling me why you dont' like coffee over ice\"?.  More free advice - - It's stinking hot here, and you have to be totally clueless not to offer your customers a descent iced coffee during a Phoenix summer.  Since he asked me why I don't like they way they serve it, I tell him that I don't like pouring hot coffee over ice because it just melts the ice cubes, and makes the drink watery. ---- DUH!\n\nI then muster all the politeness I have to ask him if he has every had toddy coffee. I mention that it's smooth, delicious & easy to make.  He goes on this diatribe about all the water that is required to make a toddy coffee taste good. I make toddy coffee at home all the time, and he clearly didn't know what the heck he was talking about. It takes time, but not a huge amount of water. HUGE SURPRISE --- When I asked him if he had ever had toddy coffee, he said he had not. The take-away from this is that hot coffee over ice is bad. However you get your hands on cold brew is up to you, but a cold brew over ice is a key component to iced coffee. \n\nSummary: Customer service is key.

Big open windows, white interior that is calm rather than bland. And the tables and space around the tables is really big.

A lot.\n\nThe reason I'm harping on about seemingly bizarre things in the face of the coffee and cake is that all the other reviewers have said it before me. The coffee (Artisan Roast coffee) was just right. The guys at Artisan can be confident Dovecot are serving up the perfect coffees with their beans. It was so good I ordered another as soon as my first was finished. Although, lovers of the S'Bucks generation of coffee be warned. The cups aren't 'MUGS' and therefore a bit smaller than a generic, spin-off imitation. If you go to Artisan Roast, or any other independent, you'll be used to the more moderate portion size. Trust me, there is no less caffeine, and far more flavour.\n\nI also tried the banana and chocolate gluten-free cake. I'm attempting gluten-free. It didn't help that I then tried a taste of Louise C's apple muffin (not gluten free) but the fact they have gluten-free cakes and can do all their sandwiches with gluten-free bread was awesome.\n\nI'm going back to try the salmon sandwich, on gluten-free, and one of their soups.\n\nBut I'm already a little bit in love with this place, the super friendly staff, the calm atmosphere, and the genuine, coffee-loving, cake-baking, good-food-loving tone to the place.\n\nThey also have post-it notes stuck up behind the counter with regular's names written on. Rather than a card you get stamped and carry around with you, your name is actually pinned up into the caf\u00e9 and they stamp that. So they may not write your name on the cup (i'm looking at you, coffeechainwhoshalnotbenamed) they'll actually remember your name, and face, in order to stamp your own wee post-it note. Love it.\n\n#IndependentEdinburgh", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 3, "cool": 4}}, {"text": "Oooh, I'm super pleased I didn't do my usual get-impatient-and-leave-when-I see-somewhere-looks-busy thing when I wandered into Dovecot Studios. I had a peek round the cafe and noticed it was bustling to the brim (lunchtime), but then one of the really nice staff dudes hopped over pretty much straightaway and did his best to source me a table quickly. That bit of instant customer service got a tick for awesomeness in my mental reviewing list, considering the guy probably had about ten lattes and 20 sandwiches to assemble. I've lost count of the amount of places where I've stood at the door, all full of anticipation for the experience ahead, then felt the disappointment start to sink in when I realise I've been waiting there for 15 minutes without actually being acknowledged.\n\nI had the very pleasing falafel and houmous salad, for which I was supplied olive oil and balsamic vinegar to apply to my own preference. Nice touch there, people are fussy about their dressing. And then, there it was...the dawn of the Dovecot espresso. I could almost see the stag in the distance, watching and nodding its head slowly in approval as I sipped on the most bloody delightful espresso macchiato I've had in some time. If I say it had a chocolatey taste and texture and a full-bodied hit that made my afternoon typing fly with a bang, then I probably wouldn't be using the right coffee lingo...but what I had in that cup was good, anyway. I'll be returning to try and make my way round the menu - whether it's a tasty-looking slice of sweetness I'm after or some savoury goodness, or...actually...oh dear...I really need one of those espressos RIGHT NOW.

It would have been nice to have a more cakey/pastry option! \n\nThe coffee here is supplied by artisan roast, and tastes really spectacular. It's a good size too, and is really like that which you would order at a good bar in Italy-strong, with a sharp crema, but not too bitter.

After reading \"A Little Princess\" when I was 8, I wanted to be the little princess. After reading \"The Secret Garden\" I used to hope and pray I would find a secret door in our old walled garden leading to a hidden garden. Whilst it was an age that wasn't kind to women, I still have fantasies of dressing up in period dresses, with a morning dress for breakfast in the morning room, a going out dress with umbrella and hat for a stroll in the garden, and then a lighter frock that matches the colours of the upholstery in the afternoon tea room.\n\nThat last paragraph wasn't essential to this review, but it gives some context to why I was so enamoured with afternoon tea at the North Bridge Brasserie. The hidden room you can only be led to for your afternoon tea is a delight, and the setting and service is definitely the closest to the old-fashioned style of afternoon tea anywhere I've found in Edinburgh. Many places do afternoon tea, offering the three tiered cake stand with scones, cake, sandwiches and tea. But that's just the food. What the North Bridge Brasserie offered was the whole experience.\n\nTHey set up a table for 12 people and took all our orders, accomodating gluten free, vegetarian and no-fish. They then brought us all our afternoon delights. Rather than putting everything on individual, or between two, cake stands, they brought out all the sandwiches, then all the scones, then all the cakes. This was more practical, although did take away from the lovely feeling of 'all my food on one cake stand' slightly.\n\nI had the gluten free option, shared with Claire L. The sandwiches, well - you couldn't tell the difference between the gluten free bread and regular. THe scones, whilst slightly smaller than the regular scones, were equally delicious and you couldn't tell they were gluten free. I can't really complain about the size of the scones, as there was so much food we got several doggie bags to take home after. 6 finger sandwiches each, a huge scone, and at least 5 or 6 mini cakes which were all very rich. \n\nOn the gluten free cake stand there was the 'dime bar cake' made with almonds (Claire L tells me you can buy this in from supermarkets and at Ikea), a white fudge, chocolate truffle, cranachan, chocolate brownie, mini meringue with lemon curd... A lot of cakes! I was envious at the lack of carrot cake, and wonder if they could add more 'sponge like' gluten free options to the gluten free cake stand, using gluten free flour. But again, I can't complain as it was all lovely.\n\nThe tea itself was really the only less-than-lovely exprience. Many people ordered earl grey, myself included. It was very weak, no matter how long we let it brew, and was distinctly lacking the earl grey flavour. It was just...weak all over. There is nothing more pleasurable than a sip of scented, bergamot earl grey tea followed by a bite of a scone lathered in clotted cream and jam. It is afternoon tea after all, with the emphasis on the tea. So the fact that this tea was perhaps stale and lacking flavour was a bit sad, and was a noticeable drop in standard, given the rest of it was all exquisite.\n\nHowever, I would definitely return and perhaps get a regular, stronger tea. This would be my highest recommendation for afternoon tea in the city. It's central (a 2 minute walk from Waverely Train Station), in a gorgeous building fitting to the tradition, and in a beautiful room with light, open windows, with delicious, home-made food and very attentive, kind service. \u00a316.95 per person for the regular afternoon tea, and \u00a320.95 for a glass of prosecco.

We were then handed to the very capable hands of a function manager - she took our coats and  sat us down.  \n\nwe were sat on a table with full linen and (porcelain?) crockery. Our water glasses were promptly filled. Once we all sat down she placed the napkin and took our tea orders. They had a full complement of loose teas.\nI went for the famous Scotsman breakfast and an additional Jasmine green tea. These are served in full sized classic teapots and strainers.\n\nShe also fully explained the delight that were served to us - after ensuring that there were any dietary requirements.\nScones, clotted cream, sliders, bon bons, profiteroles, soldier cut crust-less sandwiches with salmon cucumber, egg, ham, cheese and also some flap jacks and carrot cakes.\n\nThe acoustics of the room allowed for a conversation to be followed from all over the table without getting too loud., although the level of conversation topics was at times a bit questionable, but that cannot be attributed to the Scotsman :o)\n\nI had a wonderful time and relay enjoyed the visit.

You need to get buzzed in so I felt like I'd passed some kind of test when I was allowed in. Then there's an elevator to take you up the four stories to the level where afternoon tea is served (it's the street entrance off North Bridge, which gives you an idea of how ridiculous Edinburgh is. No wonder I get lost every time I go there). \n\nThe afternoon dining area is pretty nice although definitely has the feel of a hotel restaurant. The tables are a bit too cramped for four ladies afternoon tea-ing at the same time. For \u00a319.95 per person you get a tower of treats between two people including all the usual suspects -\u00a0sandwiches, desserts, scones and tea or coffee. I opted for a gluten free option and was pretty impressed at the selection - it all looked pretty delicious. The sandwiches were nice (although egg mayo sandwiches should be outlawed) but I was let down by the scone which was a little rock-like and hard to eat. The desserts on the top were pretty lovely and I liked the lemon posset the most. \n\nService was fine, and the place wasn't particularly noisy.

Platter to share? It's there, abound with venison, salmon, cheeses, deli items, roast veg. Little nibbles? You bet, there's smoked salmon and pates galore. Or a bigger, heartier meal? Yes please. Make mine the chicken breast with sweet potato mash.\n\nYes, still a little pricier than a pub-dinner, but oh it was worth it. The food really was delicious, prepared wonderfully, seasoned to perfection, I can't really complain about anything. \n\nAnd the desserts, chalked up on BOTH sides of the chalk board. Theres little treats (tray bakes, scones, mince pies) and then the larger desserts (banoffee pie, cheesecakes and more). All 4 desserts my companions and I sampled induced those *eyes to heaven* moments, and made my taste buds literally tingle.\n\nYes Peckhams, you may have left my wallet a good few pennies lighter, and my waist line a good inch wider, but you were worth that sacrifice.

Hum... interesting because I have eaten here during the week before... \nWell, that combined with the abysmal meal we consumed, left me wondering if it is now under new management.\n\nThe menu has changed completely and it appears that if you want lunch or dinner, you have to buy into their two or three course set menu.  \nI don't really like eating a lot of courses, but can handle it for dinner... not for lunch.  All I really wanted was a panini with a side salad but had to order two courses of very sub par scran.\n\nMy starter was fish cakes, while the man had tomato and rocket soup.  The fish cakes were mostly potato and the bits that were actually fish, were a) smoked (an important detail to include on the menu) and b) undercooked.  I know that fish doesn't have to be cooked through, but when it's in a fish cake, you expect it to be.  My man's soup didn't taste like it has been seasoned.  It was as though tomatoes and rocket were blitzed together and heated up.  \n\nFor my main I originally ordered the Thai Green Curry with sweet potatoes and noodles (it sounded a bit strange, but I love green curry so wanted to try it) but they were out, so I went with chicken.  The man had a lamb burger.  My chicken, while well cooked, was literally swimming in a mustard sauce which completely masked the flavour of the meat and made the whole dish just taste like mustard.  It was accompanied by (again) un-seasoned and poorly roasted new potatoes, and some odd sloppy looking artichoke hearts and roasted bell peppers.  The man's burger apparently tasted a bit strange, and his oven chips were a bit under done.  \n\nMy man is the least picky eater in the world, and he actually sat across from me and said \"this food is pretty crap, isn't it?\"\nWe both agreed that it was like we'd been given posh canteen food.  \n\nTo add to this, the restaurant was full but it is small enough that with two waitresses working, we should have gotten much better service.  Our waters were never re-filled, it took ages to catch someone's eye to get the bill, then ages for them to come pick it back up again to give us change.  \n\nThe kicker was that two courses set us back \u00a322 - \u00a311 each.

She never apologized for not refilling his coke sooner, just acted flustered when my husband asked for it. Btw, this was not a busy Monday night. When she came back, she refilled his coke and put the check on the table. And the coke was flat. Like it literally tasted like watered down syrup.

We didn't tip and I ALWAYS tip even if the experience isn't that great, as long as the servers are nice and food is ok. I would have tipped if the coke had been taken off the bill. Also, as we were walking away from the table we saw the bus boy counting out the money we left right there at the table in front of all the other guests!

We hit the Yelp app looking for a coffee place close by that served breakfast.  When we first walked in, I was ready to leave since all I saw were pastries (although good looking ones) on glass stands, and I had an abandoned cup of (albeit crap) black coffee in the car.\n\nI was squinting to look at a printed breakfast menu encased in a photo holder, when one of the baristas quickly handed me a printed menu.  Belgian waffle, oatmeal, yogurt parfait, french bread with an egg. . . nothing was really catching my eye. I had the feeling these items were a second thought to coffee because they needed to get people in with another option.  We thought about leaving (shame on us) and decided to just get the kids a couple of yogurt parfaits to tide them over until after the next match.\n\nThat's when my feelings started to change.  After being handed my latte, the barista asked, \"How is it?\"  Sincerely.  Like he actually wanted to know.  Well, it was great.  It was the best coffee I've had in a long damn time. They walked out the hot chocolates to the kids, even though we were almost close enough to hand them to.  It's not often servers treat kids like customers.  As we sat, I checked out the woman at the next table eating the oatmeal.  It had a crunchy brulee top with fresh fruit and looked nothing short of divine (well, as close as oatmeal can get). She was friendly, and told me it was as good as it looked.  Next, someone came out of the kitchen and told us they only had enough yogurt for one parfait, what else could they get us? Waffle? Granola? Egg? No big deal, just polite, what can we do attitude.  Kids voted waffle with whip cream of course.  Belgian waffle came out perfectly cooked - brown, slightly crispy, still soft in the inside with a cloud of fresh cream on it.  Next, the parfait - plenty of granola, tart yogurt, ripe strawberries and blueberries abound. Delicious.\n\nMy opinion now. . . breakfast might have been a second thought, but it's not treated like one.  Everything we saw was pretty, tasted great, and had fresh ingredients.  And the coffee. . . well I was just jonesing for one on another wet, soggy morning.  We'll definitely make a trip back to Cave Creek to visit this little hideaway.\n\nOh - and those pastries?

Firecreek has been populated around the greater PHX area for a bit now, but I have to say, sadly, they've done them little justice.  Today we made the trip for two reasons: 1) our own curiosity, 2) a local shop who uses Firecreek asked us to check them out personally (they're not really coffee people).  We made the drive from downtown PHX, quite a trip, but certainly worthwhile.  San Francisco roaster in the back, in clear view through the main room window.  Bags of green beans.  Penny farthing (+1) hanging in the roast room.  Great feel in the rooms.  Outdoor seating galore, in the shade or not.\n\nThe four people working there today were fantastic and friendly.  John was our main engaged person, of who was a joy to deal with.  We started with two pourovers.  Those who know me know I am always skeptical of a pourover at a new place.  I'm very picky when it comes to this brew style, so rightfully so, I am worried when first trying out a place.  Watching John do his magic was also a little worrisome.  It takes a lot out of this style coffee to please me, so seeing his method + being my first experience with in-house FC...I wasn't expecting much  Boy was I wrong.\n\nThis cup trumped the vast majority of PO's that I've savored.  Phoenix's scene for good coffee isn't huge, and excellent & exciting - Eek!  Full of flavor, body and greatness.  Next up was a shot each.  He warned us the beans were a bit fresh due to their high level of traffic of late.  The shots were pulled consistent and appealing.  Taste was full, citron-esque and a tad caramel-syrup-like; no complaints at all.  Lastly, we partook of a cappuccino.  This was my only complaint of our visit (other than the fact that the shop is a good 30 miles from my house).  I went for my initial taste, of which it scalded me (I wasn't the only one) - it was a bit too hot, and remained so.  I looked beyond this, though it was important to me.  Espresso came through in nose and taste though, so this was good, though the drink was a bit wet (but there was definitive froth).  Four hours later: my tongue still complains.\n\nI can't knock them for the one issue I saw though, in all honesty; I was too thoroughly impressed otherwise.  One thing that slightly bothered me, and would make me feel more at home here: we came and explained we'd be here a while, ordering 3+ drinks each, tasting, testing, enjoying.  The only drink of three to be made into a non-paper cup was the shots.  If I'm staying and savoring, it's not only a waste, but makes me feel like less of a person that belongs / should stay.  Lastly, give spoons to espresso folks (possibly even small glasses of water or seltzer).\n\nI didn't enjoy a cuppa here, as I'm even more snobby about my tea and afraid therefore.  The selection was decent, though both blacks were Earl Grey (ehhhhh), and while I could define the teas, \"citron blend\" means little.  Dragonwell (longjing) - green: faint sweetness and citron - use something like that!  Food looked excellent and delicious, though we didn't enjoy anything but coffee drinks.\n\nA- though.

It was a big improvement from the Chinese buffet house that used be here.\n\nFrom then on it went downhill. The menu was small, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but there was little for vegetarians. I wanted to have soup with something else but my only options were basically soup with mushrooms or some mushroom quiche. In the end I just went with the soup.

I am a big fan of their cakes and this was the first place to introduce me to the delights of chocolate beetroot cake, I know it sounds like a pretty eccentric combination, but the main ingredients really compliment each other: the chocolate is rich and sweet and the beetroot keeps the sponge moist. \n\nIt can get pretty busy, the Newhaven locals have really bought into this place, so it can mean a bit of a wait for a table, do wait though - it's worth it.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I need to declare up front, I'm an Eggs Benedict fan. Some people aren't and that's cool, but if you even remotely partake, every now and then...get down to Porto & Fi and experience what is possibly the best hollandaise you'll ever have. Magic!\n\nVery friendly table service and a great seaside setting make this a place to come as a family, group or single...not to mention the fab cake offerings and daily specials.\n\nYou may wonder why only a 4 star review given the massive compliment above? Well, the coffee was ok, but SOOOOOO hot I had to wait 10 mins before I could get my lips to it.

Wandered in on Friday afternoon last week with a couple of friends and we were I suppose lucky to get a table straight away as the place was heaving. Once seated the number of other customers revealed the first downside to the cafe - its acoustics. Either this was an unusually loud collection of customers or anything over half full always results in such a cacophony but it was noticeable for the entire time we were in there and as such offputting.\n\n\n Waiting time, service, quality of food (eggs florentine, beef olive and lamb shank) and prices (the pot of tea was particularly good value for money) were all fine but I'll think twice about going back in if the number of punters is that high next time.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Ditto to the person who said the Eggs Benedict is good.

I'll come clean, I don't really like houmus, and I ate it twice this weekend. The second time was clearly a homemade houmous, and tasty to boot, but what was standout was the aubergine chutney - spicy and made a lovely contrast to the plainness of the houmus. Rounding off with some homemade cake (bakewell tarts, tray bakes and apple & black cherry crumble), the crumble itself reminded me of the jubilee pancakes that you used to get at a Little Chef (syrupy cherries... fab!).

It's Monday around 1100 and hungry tummies are looking for breakfast in Leith, there are a few options, but we chose P&F, and were glad we did. From the outside it just looks like a wee caf\u00e9, but it's a good size once you get in.\n\nWelcomed immediately by a friendly waitress, we were told to sit anywhere we liked. Lots of reserved signs, but they had a time on them so we knew we could use a table by the window which was a good spot. Not the best views, but it wasn't the best weather. They already had a few tables already in, and some were getting cleared.\n\nThe Menu was simple, but had a good range of brunchy stuff on it, and as always I couldn't see past the Eggs beny with Salmon, which were fantastic. Obviously free range eggs with a bright yellow yoke, poached  like a pro and perfectly runny. The Salmon was nice and salty, with a really rich flavour. Accompanied with freshly squeezed orange juice and an awesome double espresso (I think Swedish coffee?). There wasn't much conversation for a few moments....\n \nThe food didn't last long, but we weren't rushed, when the waitress cleared I asked if they were getting ready for a rush? She said they are busy for lunch most days and normally do a good early dinner trade also - if all of their food is that flavoursome I can understand why.

However, after having been there regularly for a couple of years I have to say both the food and the service have become a little patchy.\n\nIt still gets three stars, because when they get it right, it's superb. But then you get things like a plate of eggs benedict where the Hollandaise sauce has clearly split and tastes of nothing but vinegar. It's pretty rookie stuff and has happened to me several times.\n\nThe service can be a bit shambolic too. They stop serving breakfast at 12, so one weekend I was sat down and ready to order 11:50. By the time my order was taken, it was bang-on noon and they flatly refused to serve anything from the breakfast menu.\n\nThat said, there's some great stuff on the menu (the fish goujons served in a wee galvanised bucket are great) and the coffee is always really good.

Each time I have had about 20-40 minutes for a quick pot of tea and sometimes with a baked good. They serve Eteaket tea here, but as with many coffee shops and cafes you have to be sure to order one of the specialty teas in order to get it. The house blend is just regular tea bags, not bad but not great. I have had the Eteaket chai teabags a couple of times and really enjoy those. As far as the baked goods I have tried a malteser slice (or something similar) and a scone. Both of these are nice, but nothing that I would travel across town for. And I guess that's partly why I give the place only 3 stars at the moment... Porto & Fi is worth a sit down if you're closeby, but not something I would go out of your way for.
