I have to admit, there were about three times that I contemplated leaving and just coming back at night when the sun wasn't pounding down (it was definitely hot) but I was so close...I decided to wait it out.\nOrdered me a small cheesecake ($2) with ice cream ($.75)\n\nI watched as all the colorful orders came out before mine and then my turn.  Such a sad looking snowcone - there was absolutely no color and looked like a cup full of ice..I wondered if I made the wrong choice in flavor.\nI was so wrong!  The flavor oozed through with each lick and spoonful.  The ice is so soft and the small was good enough for both me and my hubby who I shared with once I got home.  Our two other roommates just had to listen to us enjoy this wonderful treat...LOL.  \n\nI'll definitely be back tonight and this time with three more curious souls.  :)\nI'm so glad they are just down the street from us and not across town.

The Japanese inspired food truck delivers in creativity, but needs to work on execution. \n\nI went with the #1 Fuku Burger that costs $5. Its your traditional burger of tomatoes, lettuce, and onions, but with pickled garlic and their Fuku sauce. My first bite, I knew I wouldn't be a fan of it. First, the sauce drowned the entire burger, so you really couldn't taste anything else. The burger patty also had something in it, possibly the garlic that just obliterates the pallet where you can't even taste anything anymore. Lastly, they used a lot of salt, and I mean a lot of it. I'm not one to usually ding a place for using MSG or anything else that makes you thirsty, but I never EVER had to drink so much water after eating a meal. 4 full glasses of water last night and as I'm writing this review, drinking even more water. Ridiculous. \n\nFor mentioning Yelp, I got the free flavored ice mountain. Mine was really a mountain, I think it was taller than the Stratosphere.

However, its not a good sign especially for a grand opening.\n\nThe wait time for the food is similar to Slider Truck, but I would say Fuku is slightly faster.

Definitely not a place to grab a quick bite.\n\nAgain, I'll say the same thing as I did for Slider Truck as a suggestion for this place.

Like many others I attended the grand opening of the Fukuburger Truck on July 4th.  I love the creativity that went into creating a menu that put together Japanese ingredients and the American burger.  I like how each burger has one unique ingredient that makes me want to try the entire menu.  Fukuburger is on the right track, they just have some fine tuning to do.  \n\nI had myself the #5 Karai (burger with cucumber, lettuce, avocado cream, spicy mayo) while my friend had the #2 Tamago (burger with fried egg, onion strings, teriyaki and furikake).  We also shared a side of macaroni salad topped with furikake.  \n\nThe Karai had some good flavors going for it; when you got lots of sauce in that bite.  Take one bite of the burger alone and you have yourself a mouthful of salty beef.  I'm not sure what seasoning was used but it certainly felt full of sodium.  The Tamago also had some saltiness issues, but had a great flavor mix going on with the yolk of the fried egg.  The mac salad was...mac salad.  It didn't disappoint but didn't make my taste buds explode either.\n\nTwo burgers, a mac salad, and a bottle of water came out to $15; which would normally be fine, as there are other burger places in town where you can expect to spend at least $10 per person.  The thing with Fukuburger, though, is that $15 and a couple burgers later, my friend and I were still ready to eat more.  Larger than a slider, but smaller than a Kilroy's burger, a Fukuburger sits in the weight class where you want to have a side of fries to leave your stomach satisfied.\n\nAs is, I might could see myself stopping by Fukuburger again if it's nearby and I really want a burger.

I usually find it to be dry and lacking flavor. Fortunately, Fuku's Katsu burger is the exact opposite - juicy and tender, and none of that oily yucky after effect.

Thing I hate most is eating outside and in the heat, but this burger was worth eating outside out of the back of my friend's car and in the heat.  I had the Tamago Burger which is the burger with a fried egg, crispy onion strings, topped with teriyaki & something else I can't read it off the menu. \n\nOne of my friends had the Naga dog which is a spicy link topped with home-made pickled daikon relish and grilled kim chee. Drizzled with wasabi mayo and kabayaki sauces then finished with hari nori.  Colin said it's like the Jap dog in Vancouver.  Makes me miss Vancouver lol.  \n\nMy other friend Jas had Buta-burger.  Apple wood smoked bacon, american cheese, pickled ginger, + Japanese bbq sauce. \n\nAll of it was mouthwatering.

Sure it may get hot during the day in the summer but when night rolls around, being outside is simply majestic.  Why not then, combine the social aspects of dining with the wonderful atmosphere that a desert summer night can provide?  Well the guys behind the Fukuburger truck have done just that.  Not only have they created a social atmosphere unlike anything else in Vegas, they have created a menu that doesn't suffer one iota from the limitations that a mobile kitchen can create.\n\nSetting up shop in a non-descript parking lot in Chinatown on Spring Mountain, the truck may be small but packs a hell of a culinary punch.  After meeting one of the owners Colin, he walked me through the menu and explained all the ingredients are made from scratch and sourced from local Asian markets.  Everything he showed me looked and sounded great so I asked him what his favorite was and he said the Tamago Burger.  Never one to shy from a good recommendation, I ordered that with some of their garlic fries that come with an Asian inspired aioli sauce.  \n\nAs I waited for my food to be prepared, the stream of people coming and ordering their dinner was non-stop.  Patrons were also pulling up their cars, playing music, drinking beers they brought and the whole atmosphere reminded me of a tailgate if it was hipsters running the show and not jocks.  It then donned on me that Fukuburger had really captured something awesome.  Food at the end of the day is food, some is better than others.  What truly makes a place special is if they pair their food with an atmosphere that does the food justice.  For some spots that mine mean white table clothes and an ocean view.  For others, that might mean nothing more than the American look of greasy spoon and for Funkuburger, it was the energy of Chinatown and Las Vegas and the desert warmth.  \n\nI devoured my food as soon as it was prepared and enjoyed the complex flavors that the Asian/burger fusion provided.  The guys behind Fukuburger have really explored their Asian roots and let their imaginations run wild with their creations.  The Tamago Burger I got had an egg, onion straws and the meat was marinated in Teriyaki and other spices of the Orient.  A nice treat for this Jewish boy.  The fries were good too, nothing that will set the world on fire but they certainly complemented the burger nicely.  \n\nThe prices are very reasonable (think 7-8 bucks a person) and the service very friendly and accommodating.  In the end, I came for the food and stayed for the atmosphere.  I cant wait to come back and visit the Asian-inspired tailgate party that captures the true essence of social dining.\n\nI hate gushing but they had me at Fuku....", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Caught the Fukuburger truck tonight in Chinatown.

I received several un-necessary apologies for the wait (they were maybe a dozen or so customers hanging out) and for not having my food wrapped to go (that was entirely my fault because I didnt know they could wrap stuff up to go).\n\nThe menu is short (6 different burgers and a hot dog, strawberry lemonade, shave ice, french fries and mac salad... i think thats it).\n\nI ordered the Tamago (Fuku patty with a fried egg, crispy onion strings and a nice sprinkling of furikake) and my boyfriend ordered 2 Karais (spicy burger with yummy seasoned cucumbers) thinking (for some reason) they were spicy chicken sandwiches. Maybe because it was next to the Chicken Katsu burger? I don't know. I also ordered fries and a strawberry lemonade.\n\nOMG.\n\nThe burgers were hot, juicy and delicious. The lemonade refreshing but not overly sweet.  The french fries had a yummy seasoning and were served with 2 different dipping sauces (some kind of creamy one and another sweet and sour type sauce).\n\nMy boyfriend is an unofficial burger snob and he was impressed by the flavors and by the fact that this \"fast-food\" truck didnt overcook his patty...they weren't even taking temperatures...just cooking them a yummy medium/medium-well.\n\nBottom Line:\nHot, juicy burgers with a Japanese twist from a trendy food truck. Bring your own seating or do what we did and take it home.  At $5 a pop we are definitely finding this truck again. Oh...

We asked the Red Handed Tattoo people when they'd be there and they said 7, so we waited and they still weren't there at 7! We ended up calling the truck and they said they were running late and would be there at 8. That STILL didn't happen. They ended up coming at almost 9. We waited for almost 3 hours. They could've at least twittered something about being late... It was our first time ever going to the truck and it wasn't making that great of an impression on us. That was...until we tried the burgers ;) The burgers turned out frowns upside down cuz it was definitely worth the wait. \n\nSince it was already 10pm when we finished our burgers we decided to drive around and come back at like midnight since they were suppose to have people break dancing. We came back and people were barely breaking; They'd kinda just keep going and doing random tricks. The music was horrible too; I wish I would've just gone up and plugged in my mp3. They would keep changing the volume of the music and keep changing songs because there was nothing good on their ipod. We kept staying longer cuz we thought something good was going to happen, but it was already 1am and no one was really breaking, so we just left. I'm sure Wednesdays will get better for them once they start getting more popular though. \n\nThey're pretty quick with the output of their orders for the most part. We've never had to wait more than 15 minutes for our food, but I've seen some people that have. Just the other day we went here with a few friends and they ordered about 10 minutes before us, but we ended up getting our food like 30 minutes before they got theirs! I didn't really understand what happened, but they were given FREE strawberry lemonade and FREE shaved ice for waiting so long. I think that was a pretty good recovery. \n\nI really love the Tamago burger, it has egg in it which I LOVE in my burgers. The fries and mac salad are bomb as well. Sometime they put too much seasoning on their mac salad though, so you gotta make sure to really mix it in. \n\nWe're pretty fond of this truck because it's a pretty laid back place to eat and they're open late!

The whole burger worked perfect together.  I loved the texture the burger itself had, I love the japanese bbq sauce, and i love the combo of the pickled ginger and red onions.  Everything was great.  \nThe togarashi fries were also really good.  A little hint of spice and served with some special sauce and ketchup, and the fries themselves were nice and crispy.  \n\nThe Naga Dog was also very good.  The hot dog itself was pretty big, and was very crisp in texture.  Topped with nori, and a bunch of other stuff that I have no idea what it was.  The flavor combination worked very well, and was pretty spicy, too... kinda like a chicago red hot.  \n\nWhat my friend and I both were impressed with was their flavor combination's and seasonings.

What a colorful and moody character you seem to be.\n\nAfter a night of shenanigans, the boy wanted a treat. Having spotted the illusive Fuku-truck on our way elsewhere, we hoped they'd still be there when we were done. Around 2 AM, they were, and had a big crowd of costumed fans gathering around. Descending upon the Bank of America parking lot, you can hear their music blasting; we arrived to a song about capping people and a chorus of gun-shots and the N-word. Kind of awkward, but whatever. It seems there's a lot of repeat customers or fans that hang around the truck, as there were people parked and hanging out by or in their cars for the entire duration we were there. \n\nThere was no sense of organization in the line, just a clusterf**k of people mobbing around the lone girl taking orders. We had several people attempt to get in front of us and others asking us where the line ended. Some people stood on the periphery of the cluster and waited for 10+ minutes in the cold in skimpy costumes before getting frustrated and leaving without anything.\n\nThe music was also so loud that it made ordering a challenge unless you got in the poor girl's face or yelled at her. She took our name and put our order in. When done a guy would scream out your name  from the window, vainly competing with the music. We watched him call for 4-5 people with visibly growing aggrivation. \n\nThe menu itself was pretty simple, though I know you can customize with eggs or extra patties. We opted for the Karai, or spicy burger, and an order of their garlic fries. We ate the fries on the drive home and had the burger once there. The fries seemed like they were from a box then heavily dosed with their garlic salt. I liked the sauces that came with them, but J thought they were too salty. The fries had decent crunch and heft- they weren't potato needles or massive steak fries.\n\nOnce we got to the burger, we were disappointed. The burger had flavor but was burnt on the outside and ultra-rare on the inside. Topped with a spicy mayo, another sauce, cucumber, avocado \"cream\" and a couple of other toppings, it had an interesting combo of textures and flavors to compliment the meatiness, but not enough to save it from being mediocre. The burger may have been more redeemable if the experience/atmosphere of ordering it hadn't put us off. \n\nThe area around the truck was trashed with half eaten food and debris everywhere. Stickers and photos covered much of the windows and the only insights we had into the kitchen was the irritated guy sticking his head out and yelling at a \"mutha fuga'!\"to get back in the truck. \n\nThis is really an instance where the business philosophy shines at the forefront. Compare these fellows to the Slider truck; The boys there sing while cooking, happily greet their customers with enthusiasm & a fist bump, maintain a clean exterior and fairly consistent food preparation. I've had a mediocre slider and forgiven them because they were so pleasant to deal with.

Not very many places to sit but when you're coming to eat at a truck I don't think you'd be expecting an abundance of chairs and tables just lined up for your convenience, so it's understandable. The staff is friendly and I think one of the most memorable things while you're just sitting around waiting is that when somebody tips, the person taking the order yells out \"TIP JELLY\" and so does everyone else on the truck and participating customers as well.

BF said it's the most amazing panang style he's had and it definitely was up there for me. \n\n\"Chicken and Waffles\" Okinawan Style- Chicken skewer was crispy outside yet juicy with interesting spices that I can't quite place. Came with donuts with a cinnamon coating and syrup which was soft and super noms. I like the dishes separately and not together and wish I can order more donuts. \n\nThai Mi Bahn Mi- Thai style bahn me sandwich with sliced sausage, cucumber, carrot, cilantro, jalapenos. This was good with the contents, but the bread was just okay. It was chewy and not that crispy crackling bread you come to associate with bahn mi sammies. \n\nMuch respect to Jet Tila for coming out of his fancy kitchen and come cook in a moving box. \n\nI know it was a Fuku hosted special event, but it made me respect their business as a whole. I like that they think outside the box. I've heard that Westside Wednesdays has DJs, car enthusiasts, artist, etc. show up and show off and it becomes more of an event than a stop.

The meat is cooked to perfection... in otherwords... it's medium rare.  Juicy, what you would imagine a sushi chef making if he was making the best burger you've ever had.

First, my boyfriend and I got Tastybunz, where we waited about an hour altogether. After trying that, we made our way over to Fukuburger so we could try it for the first time. The line was just as long as Tastybunz's was, so we figured we would wait about the same time. This was not the case at all. We waited in line for an hour just to order, but then waited yet another hour for our food to come out. The waiting was awful considering there were obnoxious drunk people spilling beers on your feet, screaming in your ears, and blowing smoke in your face. Also, we were completely turned off when we noticed the guys of Fukuburger were serving their friends who were simply just walking straight up to the pick up window asking for food and receiving it immediately. I understand these people were their friends, but it was incredibly annoying and frustrating considering we were waiting forever just to get 2 burgers, along with about 30 other people too. When our order was finally ready, we grabbed our food and left the area so we could eat in peace. At this point, we were agitated and tired of standing, but nonetheless excited to get our first taste of Fukuburger. Sadly, after taking our first bite, we came to realize that the burgers were completely raw and inedible. We were so disappointed and mad that we had just wasted money and time on burgers we couldn't even eat. With that said, I gave two stars only because the actual flavor of the rest of the burger was good and I do understand it was probably hard feeding a crowd so large.

Of course my main thing is burgers, so that's pretty much all I care about at this point. This whole food truck scene is a bit pretentious for me, I don't appreciate having to get to one of their locations early, only to stand in line and fight to hopefully get a burger before they sell out. If I have to work too hard for my burger, then you're never going to get me to eat one. Oh and let's not forget that almost every food truck scene I've been around in Vegas has been attended primarily by our entire high school population. I tried one time to actually be at Fuku's scheduled locations, and by the time I got there they were sold out as predicted. This is the reason it's been almost a year since that time, and the only reason I ate one last week is because I happened to be on Fremont St right where they were. And good luck trying to find where they will be, if you can navigate their fairly awful, Myspace-like website, their schedule isn't always up to date so finding where they will be tonight may not always be possible unless you are also following them on Twitter or some other social media site.\n\nAs for the d\u00e9cor, in this case we can only really mention the truck itself as they don't have a fixed location at this point. The truck is fairly clean looking, aside from the loads of stickers, and slight grime on the shelves which you can maybe see in the background of the burger closeups. There is a hot girl taking your orders in the midst of slight madness. There seems to be some planned method for order placement and pickup, but the drunks on Fremont don't quite allow this to flow smoothly, neither do the homeless that are assaulting you for an add to your order for them. Also, the megaphone that's used to call out your name could probably stand for a replacement as whatever they are saying is hardly intelligible, and a decorative ring around the front edge fell off while I was there. Still, this is all part of the overall feel of getting food off of a food truck, so the overall mystique and character are quite fun. Plus I happened to catch this on Fremont st, which is my favorite place in Vegas.\n\nThe burger itself was surprisingly good. Although it looked nothing like the picture on the menu, it had great flavor and was quite fresh. The meat didn't have amazing flavor on its own, but wasn't bad by any means and still better than some sit down restaurants I've been to lately. The bun was grilled as well, had decent flavor, and was proportioned well, all considering it's of the more 'typical' variety. The lettuce was, well, lettuce. The Fuku sauce was lacking a little flavor, but maybe there just wasn't enough. The bacon was pretty tasty, although maybe a bit soggy on mine. The American cheese was ok, but most importantly melted, which is something that many restaurants can't seem to do somehow. Overall this is a good burger, similar to a Bachi burger in its Asian theme, although this doesn't quite come close to that freshness and overall tastiness.\n\nThe fries are nothing to write home about, I think I got them garlic seasoned or something, but they just seemed to be out of a frozen packet sprinkled with some garlic seasoning. I don't know if I would expect them to have a full setup to make amazing fries on this truck though, for their focus and main attention should be the burgers. I'll leave that up to the fry truck whenever someone unveils it.\n\nOverall, this burger is good, and you could do a lot worse in town. The scene isn't for everyone though, many people would prefer to sit down in a clean restaurant and get their food without having to fight for it. But if you're into the 'cultural' scene of Vegas, enjoy eating your meat on a sidewalk surrounded by drunken hipsters in 100 degree weather, then definitely get your Fuku on. Just make sure you get there early or you'll be let down.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "My momma was in town and the hubby and I had been talking about trying this place out, I have never eaten off of a food truck and trust me my momma hadn't probably even heard of such a thing (we're from small town midwest-some of them don't get out much!)  We headed downtown last weekend for a wonderful first experience that I can guarantee won't be my last or my moms!  We both had the Buta burger and garlic fries, that could have been more garlic-y but man o man were they good!  Loved sitting on the home depot buckets watching traffic go buy as we ate, great over all experience awesome friendly staff and a pretty cheap burger and fries:)", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Disclaimer: I'm rating this establishment as a food truck.  Of course it can't compare to certain establishments that offer a dine in experience, but the food is excellent for the price (You can get a very satisfying meal for less than 10 bucks), so I'm rating it as such.\n\nSo I've been a patron of this place for a year or so, since I've discovered its existence.  I've brought many people here and all of the people have raved about it.  \n\nSince I've tried every burger on its \"regular\" menu, I figured this is a good time to review.  Sadly, I'm trying to recall memories from months ago for certain burgers and foods, so I can't completely describe the euphoria in detail, but I'll do my best.  At the very most, take my following words as suggestions.\n\nLucky Burger:  This is their standard burger.  It combines the taste of the fuku-patty with the flavors that remind me of In-n-out. Don't get me wrong, it's not a copy-cat burger.  The fuku-patty is what makes all the difference.  It's a marinated marvel that is tender and melts in your mouth, and it's standard in all of their beef burgers.\n\nTamago Burger: This is an interesting burger.  It combines the classic fuku-patty with crispy onion strings, egg, and terriyaki sauce.  This probably one of the messier burgers, since the egg is not completely cooked through (sunny side up).  It's still a good burger, but I tend to avoid it because it's incredibly messy.  This is definitely one of their heavier burgers.\n\nButa Burger: This burger is for the bacon-heads.  The pickled ginger adds a special kick that isn't overpowering, but blends nicely with the miso bacon and fuku-patty.  Admittedly, it's hard to taste the miso on the bacon, so don't expect too much out of it.  But it's bacon, it makes everything better.\n\nKinoko Burger: Otherwise known as the mushroom burger, it is a slightly lighter burger.  Mushrooms are good, if you like mushrooms.  I happen to like a mushrooms, so if I'm feeling slightly guilty about going, I pick this burger.  \n\nKarai Burger:  So, admittedly, I'm a little desensitized to extremely spicy foods, so this is actually a medium spicy burger to me.  This is also a lighter burger, so if I want a little spicy kick, I'll pick this burger. \n\nChicken Katsu: It uses fried chicken!  It's amazing.  It uses a panako crust as the breading, which is a type of breading that is lighter than traditional breading but fries crisp and delicious.  The combination of the sauce and the shredded lettuce gives the impression that you've got a bento box in between the buns.  \n\nFries: there's the classic garlic fries, and the jazz fries.  The garlic fries are amazing in their own right due, and you can dip them in the included cup of crack sauce for an amazing synergy.  If you like eating fries with the fork, there's the jazz fries.  They're basically the same garlic fries with brown gravy and the crack sauce dumped on top.  I'm pretty much sold on the jazz fries.\n\nThere is also a burger that's off-menu that I haven't ordered in a while, but supposedly was mentioned in an earlier yelp review that I tried.  it's the \"Fat Hakujin\".  It's a two patty monstrosity that combines cheese, egg, and bacon and some other stuff that will probably contribute to a ride to the nearest ER one day.  If you're brave, have great family genetics, or are REALLY hungry, try it.  It's still delicious.\n\nStrawberry Lemonade is fresh and it's good!  I always order one when I come.  Apparently it's made fresh daily and mixed in this huge igloo cooler.  Unfortunately, no refills with purchase.\n\nSo food's great, how's service?  It's pretty good for a food truck (obviously my expectations aren't high), but the people are courteous when I'm there.  Of course, order to mouth times vary depending on how busy they are.  But if they're not busy, generally it's about 5-6 minutes tops.  But the sky is the limit if they're busy.  \n\nProbably fair warning is that there is extremely limited seating.  Seats are either a portable bench table, or a bunch of Home Depot buckets.  I tend to see tailgate parties if someone drives their pick up truck over or SUV/station wagon.\n\nThis food does not do terribly well when you take it home.  The flavor is still all there and good, but the textures start to fail, especially when the meat juices completely soak into the bun and the fries get soggy when wrapped in tin-foil.  It's best when you eat it within a few minutes of receiving from the truck window. Just fair warning.\n\nProbably my only gripe is their typical business hours is 8pm 'til late.  I generally like to have my dinner eaten and finished before 7, so it becomes fairly difficult to justify a 16-20 minute drive from my place to wherever they happen to be.  But if I have visitors, or I just happen to be in the area (or if they're doing some daytime event somewhere) I'll stop on by.  As far as keeping a schedule and tracking them down, they're a lot easier than some other trucks that service the Valley.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Best Food Truck BURGER I ever tried.\n\nMy wife and I went to see her cousin that cooks for Fuku Burger.\n\nWe tried the Tamago Burger, Fries with spicy sauce and had it washed down with their Special Lemonade.

I have easily spent $15-$20. When I get  Fukuburger, I usually get the Tamago Burger. It is basically a fuku burger with the egg, fries, and teri sauce. I have actually become a bit of a burger connoisseur, and I am a huge fan of the egg on burgers.  I really like that the egg is still pretty yokey. This is a warning, please do not wear white, or try to keep it away from your clothes if you are wearing white while eating this. It is a pretty saucey/ messy burger. The sauce can be overwhelming at times. \n\nYou can track them on their facebook and/ or website. They are also use to getting large crowds, so they are actually quite fast.

The fact that they are operating from a roadside truck would make you wonder why anyone would go there and eat.

BUT, their great food and schedule should more than make up for it, so \"DONT JUDGE A GOOD BOOK BY ITS COVER!\". The prices are very affordable for the average family. Service is great and they are usually at their designated location into the late hours depending on the customer traffic. Another plus is that they take debit/credit cards so you dont always gotta have cash on hand. Of course you gotta understand if there is a grip of people in line just to order that you will probably wait the same amount of time for your food. My favorite is the mushroom burger.  All thats left for them to get their 5th star is to open up an actual sit down restaurant. Oh, btw, just go to their website, fukuburger.com to find out about their schedule of locations and specials. 8 pm is their usual time they are ready to take your order at the designated location.

Had to type that in all caps, it's that true!!!  We came across this foodtruck a little over a year ago, and after eating every burger in town, this is still the reigning champion of meaty deliciousness!  'Fuku', meaning happiness (I know, it looks a lot like something else-my family is from Fukuoka) we follow their whereabouts in Vegas and make our way over to them when they're in somewhat close proximity!\n\nDefinitely a younger, hip, skateboarder cum LA following, the owners have created a Japanesque twist that elevates the All American Classic to new heights...\n\nWith foodtrucks emerging as a viable dining establishment, it's getting harder and harder to shine from the onslaught of mediocrity that you find nowadays. And especially if you go to the food truck nights or festivals, the competition is fierce and your choices boundless.  But with Fukuburger, you can't go wrong.\n\nWith six main burger choices, (check their twitter for the burger specials)  we have come to rely on the two all time favorites:  The Tamago Burger and the Chicken Katsu.  From the first time we had these two, it blew our minds right out of our car!  It's pretty pathetic that we actually haven't tried a couple of the others (The Kinoko Burger, The Buta Burger and The Karai Burger)  but it's like when you know you have to have those two, when you drove out there for those two, you gotta get those two.....(one day, we have to starve ourselves and then order all six of them at once).  That'll be a long night afterwards...\n\nSo their hamburger meat comes from Larry's Great Western Meats over on Valley View, and the quality is top notch.  This where a great burger start and ends, it should be fantastic with nothing on it, the meat has to be flavorful and rich, (not just greasy and fatty).  So these guys got it right from the start!\n\nThe Tamago Burger; A Fuku Patty (they have their own secret ingredients to make it taste divine) with Teriyaki Sauce and Wasabi Mayo, Furikake (Japanese Bonito Flakes) and then topped with Crispy Haystack Onions and A Fried Egg.  Okay folks, I want to emphasize to you about THE EGG!!!\nIt's is a perfectly cooked, runny egg that mixes with the burger to create a moist and texturally satisfying combination!  The egg squirts out upon your first bite and runs down your hand and you find yourself sucking it off of everything that it lands on!  These guys have perfected the art of egg frying in such a little, mobile kitchen!  Topped with the creaminess of Mayo and soyness of Teriyaki, we are obsessed with this flavor profile, hands down best burger in Vegas!\n\nThe next on the list is the Chicken Katsu-katsu of all kinds are our favorite dish, (Pork, Chicken-fry it and we'll eat it).  I have never had Kastu like the one at Fuku, that is one tender piece of fried chicken. The exterior is fried to a perfect crunch with a deep brown hue while the chicken is moist and soft to the bite!\nIt's topped with shredded cabbage (an accompaniment with Katsu) Crack and Katsu Sauce. It is the personification of perfection in a paper basket-Foodtruck food heaven!\n\nIt's a shame that we also haven't gotten around to their Hot Dogs, but I'm less worried about that.\n\nWe've had the Furikake Mac Salad, it's straight up dope-it's Kewpie based, so you know its for real.\n\nBut the main side that is a must is the Jazz Fries- it awesome!  It's got Gravy and Crack Sauce on top and again a twist on an American Classic to round off the meal.\n\nI can't say more about Fukuburger, you have to try it once and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.  For those who haven't tried it, or can't get to the Foodtruck, I'm sorry, but you haven't lived!!!\n\nRatings (out of Five Stars)\nFood:           5\nService:       4.5\nAmbience:  4", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "If you haven't tried these guys yet then go Fuku yourself!

So if you are in the Hollywood area, make Fuku a part of your lunch/dinner plans. Your hungry stomach will thank you!\n\nAs for the actual Fukuburger Truck, I originally gave these guys 4 stars because I'm very picky with who I give 5 stars to and it is very rare. The fact that it's a roadside truck and not a sit down restaurant, was major to me. BUT since I have been eating at their different locations regularly, I have grown to know the owners, Colin and Mags. You will not meet any nicer owners anywhere. Since these guys are customer friendly and they try to cater to everybody's requests, they have earned that 5th star! I appreciate the fact that they actually get back to you when you contact them. \n\nNow for the food. Doesn't matter if you're a first timer or not, everything on their menu is fantastic. Their beef Fuku patty is so juicy and perfectly seasoned that you will probably use it as the measuring stick to any burger you eat from that point on. What makes them unique is the different ingredients they put in their menu that you just can't find in other burger joints. Oh, and I can't forget to mention their different specials every night. Always something new and tasty. Special props goes out to Colin and Mags for actually naming their special the other night with my name! Awesome! Tell me how many other places would do that for you? Thanks again guys! Whatever you decide, you gotta get jazz fries with it. Trust me on this.\n\nPrices are reasonable compared to those other gourmet places. They take cash and cards. Remember, it's not easy to operate a food truck and they work hard so you can have a freshly cooked burger, so don't hesitate to show them your appreciation. Whether it's by tipping or giving them a great review, it's up to you.\n\nIn conclusion, you will not find a better burger truck anywhere.

That burger already has a lot of flavors going on and the fries were kind of like Wah Pow ! extra taste.  They also have strawberry lemonade which is really really sweet. Personal preference, again, on that one.  \n\nDownsides: It's outside haha and the weather in Vegas isn't always optimal.  Also, they're so stingy on napkins! Like whatthe, these burgers are so messy and how you gonna give me enough napkins for one of my hands and half my face? Ok, I exaggerate, but really, they don't give you napkins with your order. Plus it's hot...or cold (depending on the season) outside so that just makes it ten times worse. \n\nFood though=yummm! sorry for the rant!

This is generally true. They're pretty good. I've had the entire menu.

Their strawberry lemonade is a must on any hot day. \n\nAlright, I like it that much, why not 5 stars? Because half of their burgers are underwhelming. #4 5 and 6 have almost negligible toppings on them. I understand the idea behind creating umami. Nothing should be overwhelming in flavor and it should be just right. But these items just don't have a balance. Especially the chicken katsu. I've had it a couple times and it was like biting straight into breaded fat. Maybe it was just, coincidentally, a bad chunk both times. Also, the patties aren't as juicy as they used to be.

I may have just gotten a bad batch, but they were pretty forgettable.\n\n2- The Toppings, there is a point when you reach overkill, when a sandwich has more than 10 items on it you might be going a little overboard, all of the ingredients in my Porker were great, but they got lost when they were mixed all together, I actually dissected my second half and ate it piece by piece, all of the meats were amazing, but it may be a little overkill.\n\n3- Location I know finding places is hard when you start you, and the place you were at had a ton of traffic (rainbow and russel), parking was ok (hospital lot across the street), but there were no tables, benches, grassy areas, or anywhere to sit, I don't mind eating in my car, but if a group of people want to eat it can be a little hard.\n\n4- Your Hours, I know you're new and you are still getting things worked out, but being open 3 hours a day 11a-2p is not enough time for people to get a chance to try your grub. I really think with your portions and prices, you would be a better late night truck than a lunch truck, you could corner the post bar greasy food market if you found the right location and got the word out!!!\n\nI will give flowrider truck a few more tries, and hopefully they earn a few more stars, the more quality trucks this town gets, the better!!!", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 8, "cool": 5}}, {"text": "My BF just left home and I'm getting a call from him. Uhoh. \n\nNothing to worry about- he was just letting me know that he saw Flowrider right by our house. He knows how I love my food trucks, even way before it was cool to go curbside. Gotta love a thoughtful man. \n\nI grabbed the Philly Rider which is Beef  with grilled onions, mushrooms, green & red peppers, topped with melted cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and jalapenos on a 9\" grill french roll. Comes with fries and you get a choice of bottled drinks (the usual sodas, water and some Jaritos) for $10.  \n\nWowwweee this was huge of a sandwich. I grabbed a fork to work it out and I definitely think they should stock a lot of fork and knives! LOL I liked my sandwich a lot and thought the flavors work well. I do like Philly cheesesteaks but I'm not a \"cheesesteak person\" because it gets too dense and rich with just a whole lot of meat and cheese going on. I like their take because the crisp lettuce gives a crunchy texture and tomatoes and jalapenos lightens up the flavors a bit. I might be stating blasphemy for some right now in saying that I will probably get this philly over Pops. Pops is good but too damn rich that I always have to share a sandwich and get other sides and another sandwich to break up the dense flavors.\n\n I ate a good amount of fries first and I thought that it was lightly crispy and good. They weren't seasoned, but apparently before they put seasoning and some people thought there was too much so they're trying without. I added a packet of salt to get it to where I want it. Since they are sitting most under the sandwich, I think that's really where it can pose a problem with losing its crispness since the weight of the sandwich is on it.\n\nThe ingredients were fresh and quality so they weren't skimping quality to make their big quantities. Some of their options are wild like the D Porker, but I think a lot of people can get into some of the other offerings. You can always strip it down if you're not a \"topping person\".  Theres also some \"mini\" options for smaller appetites and really nothing is stopping anyone to share some of these. I got maybe a 3rd of my food it before I had to take it to-go to eat a little later. \n\nAs I was eating I got talking to the crew about food truck culture, randomness and a bit about themselves. Apparently they're not new to foodtrucks- they ran a taco truck that went to construction sites for 2 years and have gone this new route into the \"culture\". When it comes to this business, personable people go a long way. It's no secret that I go where food is good, but I frequent places where the staff/owners are people that make you feel at ease and makes me feel like I'm eating at a relatives house. In fact, \"Pelon\" reminds me of  one of my Tios.  It was very comfortable talking to Gigi who runs the orders and \"Flaco\" and \"Pelon\" manning the line. I normally never let businesses know about Yelp or that I'm a Yelper, but it was really easy to talk to them and they were very receptive to wanting to know what people think and what can be done better. I also rarely give suggestions while I'm at a business since I never want to put my mouth where it don't belong and cause tension, but since they were receptive I threw out some ideas that might help like putting fries in a paper bag on the side and maybe leaving the french fry seasoning out so people can season or not to their liking. Maybe see some locations where people can sit curbside or on some grass since that lot is really rocky (I suggested to check out the Centennial Hills Park/Library/YMCA area). I really want to see this truck succeed. \n\nAfter reading Chris M.s review, I can see where he's going with the night time venue. Don't get me wrong, I would eat this for lunch, but I'm just a late night person so I just woke up and threw on clothes at 1:30pm to catch them in the 3hour slot that they're out for the day. A few longer days or maybe a day where it's late night might bring more customers. A late night honker of a sandwich to end the night....hell yes that would be lovely. Fuku does it and they're always with a crowd. Perfect nightcap (dinner often times for night owls like me), drunk food, stoner food....and that's not a downer comment coming from me, it's a high compliment since I usually want a lot of things while in a \"altered state\" but at the same time get very oddly picky of what I would eat. This would be a good one to go to First Friday and those Thristy Thursdays bar crawls. \n\nI think for them being open only for a week they are doing good. Every truck here that's doing well had to work kinks out.  I see some promise here and hope they do well. Since they used to do a taco truck, I have to try their tacos next- The Super Tacation.\n\nOnce they get more into their Flow I can get into following this Rider.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 3, "cool": 4}}, {"text": "Due to my incurable desire to try all the food trucks in Vegas I had to stop by  Flow Rider truck since it was not too far from where I live.

I'm thinking that goes along with the sin city theme, giant proportions that are not good for you, but you can't help. Food can range anywhere from $4.50 to $20. The $20 item is this huge burger with 8 sirloin patties and many other things. \n\nAnyways I only ordered two lunch specials, the mini loco dog and the mini hydrolic, but man for $4.50 it makes me regret touching subway. I believe that there are four specials, which are mini versions of their regular menu, comes with a McDonald's medium size of fries and a 20 oz soda, great lunch deal if you ask me.  This is not diet friendly food, but you only live once. Moving on the mini loco dog which is 6 inches, its a California street dog of giant proportions. The huge beef dog is wrapped with bacon and top with avocado, lightly grilled onions, relish, some kind of sauce, and maybe parsley and jalape\u00f1os? The only nitpick I have with it is that my bread broke in the middle so it was a bit messy, but good nonetheless. \n\nThe fries were lightly crisp and nice, but were unseasoned, which is ok for me since they provide a station of the side for you to add your condiments and seasonings. \n\nThe lady who took my order was nice, told me how although flow rider truck is new they have been in the mobile truck business for a few years.\n\nOverall I like flow rider truck and hope to visit them more often in the future.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 4, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "I tried their food for the first time last Sunday at the Clark County Library for the Comic Book fair.

I didn't have much money to spend so the $6 deals were my best option although I wasn't sure it would be enough food.  Both me and my partner got the mini philly combo with just meat, cheese, onions and bread. It came with fries and a 12 oz can of soda.  We found a place to sit down and started grubbing.  The sandwich was so hot and gooey, the cheese sauce complimented the meat so well and it was hard to believe the roll could hold it all together.  The meat was well seasoned and tender, there was the perfect amount of cheese and grilled onion on it.  I was shocked, this was the best philly I have had here and I eat them everywhere.  It was so good I went to Capriottis the next day to get a philly cause Flowrider's made me crave them but the 9\" sandwich I got from Capriottis didn't even compare to the 4\" sandwich I got from flowrider.  That little 4 inches was so filling and delicious I could eat one every day if my arteries could take it.  The fries were kind of plain and I didn't see any type of sauce or seasoning available for them so about half of them got thrown away but it was okay, I was stuffed and got my moneys worth.

We had to try their ice.\n\nSure enough, as the guy in the truck puts it, their ice is shaved most similar to Waiola's.  I'd say they are very similar to Koko Nuts in Koko Marina too!  The kids had their usual, rainbow flavahz, strawberry (or cherry), banana, and vanilla, while my husband and I tried their blood orange and mango, a favorite also of one of the ladies in the truck.  Shaved ever so delicately, their ice melts in your mouth faster than it can in this 100+ heat!  Their syrups selection is great!...too much for me to remember.  I guess we will have to return again, and again, and again...!\n\nThe truck staff is uber friendly and their service is exemplary of how a small shave ice business should run itself here in this desert heat!  It's good to know that they strive for the best and most friendly service (that I have ever experienced), despite the known fact that it's way too easy for just about anyone to lure heat-stroked customers with just sweet, sweet thirst-quenching shave ice!  SnOw OnO just does it all with their service with a smile!  (^_^)*\n\nMahalo SnOw OnO for your friendly island service!!!

I went with the lychee shave ice and added some mochi balls and azuki beans.  The ice is definitely velvety smooth without the choppiness of snow cones and they managed to distribute the syrup evenly throughout the bowl so that every bite is consistent.  Mochi balls had the right amount of chew for contrast in texture and azuki beans added some depth and color.   Sweet condensed milk and vanilla ice cream were other options, but I was already dangeously close to approaching a diabetic coma, so my only recommendation would be to request them to go easy on the syrup, but then again, my sweet tooth is a bit on the subtle side.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "This is the best SHAVE ICE ever.

It was a humid night at Tommy Rocker's and instead of trying this first... we saved it until the very end. It was close to midnight when we ordered a large Tiger Blood, Horchata, and Lychee flavored shaved ice with add ons of mochi bits, ice cream, and condensed milk. Half way of making our order we were told they ran out of ice cream and received a refund for that. We were crushed by the news, since I was told by a great food source that I must get these flavors with mochi bits, condensed milk and the ice cream. Quite disappointed, but what can you do.. I know... try this truck first, then go eat the other food trucks next time.\n\nMy brother was ecstatic as can be when he first took a bite of this shaved ice. Actually he was head over balls for it! He shouted out and into the truck... \"this is the Best! I'm so happy to be here!!!\" He claims the taste was still great without the ice cream and for the musky weather.. it was perfect to have one of these to cool off your senses. I took a bite of each flavor and they taste true to its name. Horchata was wonderful and felt like I was actually having one, but with shaved ice. They even sprinkle cinnamon on top, like the real thing! Lychee was refreshing and with the bite of smooth, velvety shaved ice.. it was definitely a real, juicy treat. Now for the name Tiger Blood... the color was a fiery red and the taste... well I honestly couldn't describe it, but it was good. It didn't have a strong bite to it, but you can definitely taste it. I just love the color! The mochi bits gave the shaved ice some excitement and texture... they were fresh and soft. I enjoyed the slight marshmallow feel, it gave in my mouth.\n\nAfter taking a few bites... I thought out loud that this is a lot and attempted to take the rest home, so my Mother could try it. So I took off and with my right hand holding the shaved ice and the other on the steering wheel.. I almost did an illegal left turn on Dean Martin Dr., but on the corner of my eyes, I saw a bike cop... so braked and changed my signal to right. Bike cops are notorious to pulling you over for anything and everything, so beware!!! So I turned right and got in the middle lane to make a u-turn, but wasn't successful in completing it.. I literally had to reverse then turn my steering wheel then put it back to drive to make the u-turn.. All while holding this shaved ice cone haha I had five cars racing down like mad bulls my way and I maneuvered everything just in time to not get hit by one. Thank goodness I'm both handed!!! Dashing away and looking like Statue of Liberty, I finally made it home to give my Mother the shaved ice that was still intact and not melted. She loved it! \n\nThis Hawaiian shaved ice concept is such a brilliant idea to have... especially in the hot summer nights and after a long, hard day at work. We were all pleased with this delightful, powdery ice dessert. They even cater for Birthday parties, Weddings, and any Celebration!!! My brother loved it so much he's even wanting to book them for his Birthday Extravaganza! We'll definitely come back to try it with ice cream... Very kind people that run this truck.

It was pretty cold and one of my friend didn't have a jacket on and the owner brought out her own coat for my friend to wear while we were eating in front of the turck. \n2.

A few weeks ago as I pulled my rig out of the station to go on a call this bright yellow truck drove by. As it passed us I was able to read the name Sloppi Jo's in big letters on the side of the truck. Many of you are probably aware that \"lunch trucks\" are becoming quite popular right now. Because this truck caught my eye that morning I decided I needed to check it out. Upon visiting Sloppi Jo's webpage I discovered that they specialized in two of my favorite things: Hatch, New Mexico chiles and an owner that grew up on southern cooking. For me this is combination that can't be beat. Today I was able to track down the bright yellow truck and I was not disappointed.\nThe headline item on the menu is \"The Sloppi Jo\". I've found that anytime an eating establishment puts their name on a dish that it's the best place to start. The \"Sloppi Jo\" is slow roasted pork in a red chile sauce, topped with a fried egg and pickled onions. It's served with a large flour tortilla as opposed to a bun. To say that it was delicious would be an understatement! The pork was very tender and moist and the red chile sauce was done perfectly. The pickled onions didn't over power the rest of the meal and the fried egg was the perfect topper for the pork. This is an item I'm sure to order again on future visits.\nWhile waiting for my food the trucks owner, Jo, was putting out some dessert items. The chocolate iced cupcakes she had drew my attention so I asked about them. Jo told me they were white cake with chocolate buttercream icing. The kicker was the buttercream had cinnamon and chile pepper in it. That sold me and I'm glad it did. Some people get a little freaked out when you tell them that there is chile in a chocolate dessert, but when it's done right the end result is awesome. These are certainly done right! She also had some cupcakes that are Guinness infused. That will be dessert on my next trip.\nThe prices at Sloppi Jo's Roving Eatery are more than reasonable. Everything on the menu is $5-$6.There were a number of people at the truck eating various items and to a person they all said their food was delicious. \nSloppi Jo's website is sloppijos.com.

I might not have dared to eat here had I known this...but as it was, I have been here twice and had the chicken fajita tacos both times: once Mexican, and once Cuban-style.

Mamita's predates the hipster infestation...they survived YEARS of life on East Fremont before it was cool, so is it ANY FUCKING WONDER they don't want trendy shitty food trucks rolling in and stealing their bidness?! \n\nMamita's is like that grumpy old man in the neighborhood who's constantly yelling at you kids to get off his goddamn lawn.

Salads come in large and small and you only pay for what you cram in there. A good bonus for those who know how to pack really well! The only thing the new management added is a giant rope around the whole thing which makes it even more confusing. I really hate it.

Pork was well marinated, and tender. I liked the beef, it was charred just the right way, even though she didn't care much for it. Chicken was excellent. Just the right amount of asian ginger-based spice, some kimchi, and lots of fresh greens. Everything was cooked to order. Tofu taco was something i never tried before, so i can't compare it to any other place. It was good, although the main taste came from the kimchi and the spices (as expected).\n\nChicken wings were a little less spicy than I would like them to be, but they were tasty, and not greasy - actually a tad on the dryer side on the outside (still tender on the inside) come to think of it.\n\nFries were very good. They had the home made taste to them, and were cooked in tasty oil. The garlic fries could have used more garlic, but if you aren't a big fan of really garlic-y fries, you are bound to love the subtle flavor. Asian fries were great, with just enough zing to make them stand out from most other fast food places.\n\nCrazy sweet dough (very much like donut holes) were surprisingly good. I expected them to be more soaked with oil, but was excited to find out that they were crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside - no oil drippings, and the taste was donuty (and not oily). The powdered sugar on top was just the right amount.\n\nI was the only person in \"line\" so it took a little while for everything to come, ~15 minutes, but it was well worth the wait.

Let me preface that I am from LA and have been eating my way through all the fusion food trucks when the craze started. You can say that I've had the standard, the grail to which I will judge all others heavily. Oh, and I know how to pickle, brine and kimchee with the best of them and I have done fusion tacos all my life being part of a blended family (filipino adobo tacos, ethiopian tibbs tacos, duck confit tacos, \"bahn mi\" tacos, BBQ pulled pork and beer slaw...yeah I go there with my food). \n\nEven if I didn't have \"experience\" in this food genre, there was something off about the food. Not trying to be the \"expert\" asshole, but just saying, I know what kimchee should be like and what is good fusion since that is my style of cooking. Though the kimchee had a right amount of spice to set off the food but not  be overwhelming for meek palettes, the flavor was off and was going in a sort've bitterish, weird flavor that threw off all of us. That is my main shtick is the fusion part of the taco was not good- that is not how kimchee is supposed to be. It can be savory, a bit sour, a bit salty/briny, but bitterish and odd flavor I can't place is a no go. Best way I can describe it is if you were to botch up or have a spoiled batch of kimchee. I had a bad jar once and later found it wasn't not only sealed loosely, but my dad ate pieces out of it with the spoon he was eating lunch with contaminating it hence the off fermented spoilt flavor. So the tacos are fairly big flour tortillas but it was mostly filled with lettuce. The pork was cubes, not the usual shredded, and was soft and juicy and nice on their own, but sparse. The Tofu Egg had a lot of tofu egg in the taco compared to the pork.. It was mashed tofu mixed with the egg and with the very wet kimchee made for a soggy texture that just wasn't working for me. Also, the wetness made it a bitchfit to even eat the tacos because they were stuck to the paper container and ripped holes into my taco so it was then a \"bowl\" instead of a taco. I think it needs a \"heavier\" fry to stand up to the wetness of the kimchee (I personally would do crispy/fried tofu cubes and shredded omelette instead of blended together) or drain the kimchee a bit better before putting on the taco to avoid a large amount of the sog factor. The BF left this Tofu&Egg alone after a few bites and that guy kept saying \"I'm soo hungry\" in the car after we decided to skip \"lunch\" at 1, go to errands and go eat later here at 4. Apparently not hungry enough to down his taco. \n\nFries were yummy- crispy, not greasy and a good amount of seasoning on them. Crazy dough was good- it was crispy and doughy and not greasy at all, but it definitely needed more sugar coating on it (I dipped them in honey at home). \n\nI think Vegas needs street food since every great city has great street vendors so I give kudos to anyone who wants to get into the food stand/truck culture and start this city off. For that, I gave it a very fair 3 stars (being VERY nice) and for the fact that my fries and dough were tasty. However, I can't just live off dough and fries alone as a meal and I'm afraid as the way the cards fall that's all I'll be ordering and only if I'm at Lee's already feeling like having a snack. They were doing some sort of promotional stuff at Lees and even had a Hanshik raffle so very well an \"event\" can boggle things up.  I will come back maybe in a few months and try one taco again to give it a fair chance, but as it stands it's something I hesitate ordering again. The BF does not want to go back, he says he was really disappointed.\n\n I was set to go to Blue Nile Ethiopian food for lunch, Crown bakery for dessert  and dinner at the Slider Truck then the BF got the idea to go to this instead to bring to his mom and grandma food who weren't feeling to well. Yeah, today I feel I got shafted out of a good eating day at three places to go to one place that didn't live to the hype....I was pretty pissed I starved part of the day to eat w/ the family instead at a place near them. I have to resurrect it myself by getting in my kitchen late tonight and doing up something Chef worthy. It might have been an off day for them and everyone can have that, but shit it made my seeming good day off. It wasn't their fault we chose to come at that day and time, but we expected something worth giving up my day for and that leaves me bitter as the kimchee.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 7, "useful": 11, "cool": 9}}, {"text": "After eating at the Kogi truck in LA, I was stoked when I saw this truck set up in Lee's parking lot.

It's like two of my favorite foods ever made a delicious baby. Served on a crispy toasted bun, the sandwich is a brilliant \"why-didn't-somebody-think-of-it-sooner?\" pairing of rich, smoky (apple and pecan wood, I think?) and impossibly juicy pork shoulder and just a touch of sweet, spicy Cincy chili. Honestly the pork is a little more chopped than pulled, and while I generally prefer the latter, this is perfection. Especially when contrasted with the relatively thin texture of the chili, which is a perfect example of the unique, cinnamon-centric regional favorite. The only other spot in Vegas serving Cincy chili is Egg and I/Egg Works, and to be honest I find their chili to be overly sweet and a little dry in comparison. But this? The real deal.\n\nThe only other meat I've had there is their hot link, which is juicy with a nice snap - I wish I had ordered it with the chili. Their potato salad is the only side that I've had, and it's superb. I've heard many good things about their sweet potato casserole and baked beans and definitely look forward to trying them.\n\nTheir sauce comes in mild and spicy; as is custom I opted for the hot. Which actually had a fair amount of bite - a rare thing for me to say about anyone's BBQ sauce.\n\nA word must be said about the service.

The sauce I tried was not showy and complemented pork perfection, rather than attempting to cloak dry, under-cooked meat as is typical of many \"sauce-based\" chains.\n\nKnowing how good the meat was, I would have still given 4 stars had Top Notch tripped on the sides, but they pulled through for 5 with great service and a sweet and crunchy (from a brown sugar, pecan topping) sweet potato casserole, which was practically a souffle, and a creamy potato salad.  I even enjoyed the Texas Toast, which was an adequate shovel for scarfing the last remnants of shredded pork and sauce.\n\nNext time (read: Tomorrow), I will definitely indulge in the Cincinnati Chili - I hope to convince the owners to boil some pasta soon and serve up a 3-way, smothered in shredded cheese.

Here's a breakdown of the menu: (pictured here http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg?select=MZ000fT2g5Ww9Tw8OkCtYg)\n\nBacon Bird - cheese dough w/ creamy chicken & bacon filling (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg?select=UB2iCvcS_b-gaEbgQ1K1Gw)  Probably my second favorite.

Maria L. was spot on with her comparison to scooping up the last bit of spaghetti with your bread.\n\nBBQ Rib - cilantro dough w/ Mom's BBQ beef filling (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg?select=M21vsLD4RpfI6WtqpzNLCw)  I was surprised at how moist the beef was inside the bun.\n\nThe Dilly - green onion dough w/ Pop's ground beef filling (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg?select=IEV7U49flzyc4QKdInZnpA)  Not my preference, it was okay.\n\nHot Pig -  jalapeno dough w/ spicy pork filling (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg?select=bXvr9e0_TQ83RI3nZwDdsg)  I didn't really get any spice.\n\nThe Sloppy Bun, Bacon Bird and McCheesy were my favorites; you could eat these blindfolded and know what they were easily.  The other three didn't seem to have a distinctive flavor profile; yes, I knew that the main meat was (shredded beef/ground beef/pork) but it didn't excite the taste buds.  On my next trip I'll have to try the truffle tator tots and some dessert!\n\nMy one suggestion for eating at TastyBunz is this: don't come here on an empty stomach.  I ordered six buns for $11, and ended up eating them all!  In the end I was satisfied, and not overly full.  TastyBunz seems like the perfect spot to hit up with a couple of friends when you want a snack.

The concept is definitely unique and who wouldn't like a bun stuffed with mac and cheese.  The staff is really nice and I really like the sides.  The truffle tater tots are to die for and the Frisco garlic fries are also great.  But the buns are pretty bland.\n\nI came to the grand opening at Costco and I've tried to visit every time they are at Costco so I could try all the buns.  I've tried everything except the sloppy bun, a bun stuffed with spaghetti, which I am eager to try but they've been out.\n\nThe pork special (now called Hot Pig?) is ok but not spicy.  \n\nDad's picadilly is interesting, but not very tasty.  Like taco meat with some vegetables in it.  There is dill in the bun, but I couldn't really taste it.\n\nMac and cheese bun (now McCheesy, I think) is mac and cheese in a bun.  There is supposed to be mushrooms and/or truffle in the bun but I could not taste either.  But the second time I tried it, I got more truffle flavor in the mac and cheese. But I think I built this one up too much in my head and it just disappointed me in the end.\n\nBBQ rib bun was ok.  There is cilantro in the bun, but I can't really taste it.\n\nThe bacon bird bun is probably my favorite so far.  Nice bacon flavor and very creamy.  But again, not getting much flavor from the bun.\n\nI also tried the Me fries but they are a little overwhelming with the egg.  I could not finish it all.  I'll probably stick with the Frisco fries.\n\nThe dessert potstickers are super sweet.  So sweet they hurt my teeth somehow.  Unfortunately I just can't deal with the sweetness, but I've only tried the smores potstickers, which are fried pastry potstickers stuffed with chocolate and covered with condensed milk and graham crackers. Maybe others are less sweet.  You can try all three if you order the happy ending.  Cute.\n\nThis is the only food truck I've encountered anywhere that does not include tax in the price.  So bring change or expect to get a lot back.  3 buns are $6 without tax but $6.49 with tax, if that helps.\n\nThat being said, it's a new truck and has a lot of potential.

A litle bit pricey, but what can you do? They don't accept card so you will have some change. The buns are pretty bite size and the ratio of dough to meat is somewhat leaning on the dough side, but maybe thats the only way to cook it?\n\n The McCheesy is stuffed with mac & cheese with truffles, but it didn't seem to have a dominant truffle flavor. \n\nThe bbq rib bun was interesting, cilantro mixed into the dough and the rib was still moist, rib was tasty, but couldn't taste the cilantro.\n\nThe bacon bird is probably my favorite of the ones I've tried, reminded of a chicken bake from Costco because it had a nice creamy chicken and bacon filling.\n\nI haven't had the sloppy bun (spaghetti filled) yet because they've always been out.. arghhhh. \n\nThe bacon dog (~$4 something) was pretty delish, it is split fried, and has a heavy garlic aioli sauce.\n\nThe packaging is pretty cool and a custom sticker to seal it is a nice touch.

The menu consists of only two items, steak tacos and chicken tacos. The meat is marinaded beautifully so the flavors are intense and satisfying. And they are only $2 each! Incredible bargain! Cheese is an extra buck. You really will be blown away by something so tasty being so inexpensive!\n\nIt isn't advertised but they will also make you a quesadilla for the same price as a taco, and I find them a bit more filling! So if you want to get something a little bigger for the same price try one out!\n\nYou really can't beat this deal in oldtown and they are superb!", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Good food,when the lazy douches decide to work.

I strayed from Short Leash inorder to spread the wealthand try something new.  Their menu featured a spicy sausage sandwich,  a Caribbean pork sandwich, a pulled pork sandwich and probably another sandwich or 3 I failed to mention.  \nThe wonderful aroma of smokey goodness filled the air while I waited my turn to order.  Deciding on the pulled pork sandwich, to go, it only took a few minutes to prepare the order.  \n\nThe sandwich was served on a very sturdy roll that stood up to the sauce on the generous portion of pork.  On top of the pork just enough coleslaw and the top bun of course.  The price of the sandwich includes a bag of chips, a wet nap and a peppermint patty for dessert.  \n\nThe pork was nicely smoked and not overly sauced, the slaw did not overwhelm. The bread...couldn't tell if it was purposely toasted to the point of slighty dry in order to accommodate the sauce or if it was just dry. I'll. consider it the former. \n\nThey were also at the Friday Mobile Food Court and I saw several people with their sausage sandwich. It looked so good, definitely next on my list to try here.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "REVISED REVIEW:  TRY THE KOREAN PORK SANDWICH....OMG...AMAZING!!\n\nPulled pork sandwich with a spicy cole slaw...enough said.

I had the rib tips (a special) last night. They were dry and a little overcooked, yet still miraculously tender. They were sauced to perfection - not glopping off with every bite, but yet a good counterpoint to the dryness of the meat itself. I ate every last bite with enthusiasm. The sauce was sweet and tangy and dark and everything I want from barbecue sauce - again, perfect with the meat. \n\nThe special came with a side of rosemary tater tots, which were fantastic. I accidentally dropped one into the paper container holding the remainder of the ribs, and let's just say it was a happy accident - the sauce and the tots got along just fine. Dipping a rosemary-flavored tater tot into delicious BBQ sauce - it's just like I invented Silly Putty up in here! \n\nAnyway I was filled and very pleased with my meal for $6.50 - I can't wait to try the pulled pork, but from what I could see the different specials looked pretty amazing...

It got late and I got hungry and my desire to cook was far outweighed by my desire for the half pot roast half pulled pork special I saw advertised on facebook.

As I waited I chatted with the guy who I think is the owner on everything from the craft beer industry to my job search, he even gave me a tip of where to look for a position. 5 minutes later I had my Po' Boy and home I went.\n\nThe flavors were spot on for a bbq Po' Boy. The pot roast was perfectly fall apart in our mouth tender and the pork was nice and juicy with a nice smokey taste and there was plenty of both on there. And I am not normally a fan of slaw but the zesty slaw was awesome. The tots were far from your old school cafeteria tots they packed a rosemary punch and a garlic kick and were nice and crispy even after being in the sealed container for 10 minutes seaming up.\n\nFor the price you aren't going to beat it.\n\nHopefully I can track these guys down again and try some of their other creations.

The garlic tots were not as amazing as everyone seems to think either. They tasted like frozen tots tossed with some garlic. I wish there was more depth to them, but definitely wasn't.
