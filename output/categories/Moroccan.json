Sometimes they can be a pain in the ass trying to coax you out of your seat to dance with them.  For the fixed price of about $40 per person, you really can't go wrong here.  You will leave stuffed and feel as though you got your money's worth.

We were greeted by a typical male Las Vegas nightclub host; seeing that we were dining at a venue that promotes itself as an authentic Moroccan restaurant, I found him to be quite out of place. Upon entering Marrakech we found ourselves submerged into a relaxing, and tantalizing ambiance. If you select the basic option you are given three courses, including a dessert. I had a glass of Amazir red, a Moroccan wine, that paired nicely with my meal. This is definitely a delightful place for couples and groups. They had really gorgeous belly dancers who were very \"skilled\" at their profession, Lol. But make sure that if you are brave enough to shake it with these ladies that you have \"CASH AT HAND\" and tip accordingly :o)\n\nBefore you are served your hands are cleaned in a cute sort of ritualistic manner. Eating with your hands enhances the overall experience. If you are an average size lady, the portions may be a little big for you. However, I found myself falling in love more and more with every bite. The dessert was too much, but the overall meal kept my taste buds very excited. The servers weren't the most talkative, but I'm not sure if that was a cultural thing and that's just how Moroccan food is presented? Its also very easy to lose track of time, which makes this a great mini escape from Vegas without leaving Vegas.\n\n\nAlex: 4 stars. I've never had authentic Moroccan food, so I'm unqualified to compare. All I can say is that I was thoroughly impressed with the taste. Very flavorful and well-prepared. We ordered the three-dish meal for $25 each (a solid deal) which came with cooked veggies and dip, chicken with couscous, and dessert. I had no complaints whatsoever about the food. The dancers were great, and made sure to keep the entire restaurant engaged; bring cash for tips to show your appreciation for their talent. The atmosphere is extremely laid back. Dance with the dancers, laugh, drink, be merry. I guess what keeps it from being a true 5-star for me is two things: First, though I love the belly-dancing music, between shows it slips into cheesy Vegas techno and kills the beautiful atmosphere they've created with the interior design and lighting. Second is the Welcome-Factor of the waiters. There is none.

Liqour-wise they're stocked but, wine-wise it's pretty much all house.  \n\nOne of the highlights of the night was the hand washing.  A guy came out with a kettle of warm rose water to cleanse our hands.  Loved it!  My hands were so soft afterwards.\n\nShortly after, the first course comes out.  Shrimp, looked like shrimp scampi.  I don't eat stuff that has lived in the water, yuck.  Squiggly goo, blah.  Everyone else seemed to like it though.  \n\nNext was the harira or, lentil soup.  AOK.  Definitely a tomato/vegetable based broth. Not too spicy, not too bland, just okay.  \n\nThird course, Hummers and eggs.  More like hummus, eggplant dip, fresh vegetables, and fresh bread.  The hummus was okay.  The eggplant dip, okay.  It sort of had a bitter salsa taste to it, quite unique.  The bread was good and soothed the bitterness from the dip.  I don't eat veggies, LOL.\n\n\"Where's the beef?\"  Guess what, beef skewers were our fourth course.  I bet you weren't anticipating that.  For presentation purposes, the skewers were stabbed into a fresh pineapple and had about four or five large bites of beef (assuming sirloin) on them.  They were tender, juicy, smokey, and were really good. \n\nCockadoodle Doo was our fifth course.  This was pretty good as well.  Not good enough to go back to Marrakech but, good enough to order it from another Moroccan restaurant.  I could tell the chicken was either slowly stewed or slow cooked in a juicy sauce for many hours.  To get the flavor they attained, the chicken was obviously bone-in.  So beware when chewing because it's dark in there.  This dish also came with couscous.  The couscous tasted as though it was simmered in chicken broth (yum) and had a near perfect texture.\n\nCourse number sex. jdofa;je;wajfewioj! Six.  I don't know what the heck you call the dessert bread they served but it had fruits, nuts, and lots of powdered sugar on top.  Tasty but we were all so full by then.  Along with the dessert came the my second favorite thing of the night.  The mint tea.  It looked like battery acid but, it had this heavenly scent and flavor.  I need to find out how to make this and where to buy the ingredients!!!!  I could drink this battery acid-looking stuff everyday!\n\nHey guys and some girls, there's belly dancers that shake what their momma gave them there nightly.  \n\nAs mentioned previously, it's dark in there (remember the cockadoodle doo course).  In fact, when you walk through the front doors you immediately walk through large red drapes and, from there it feels like you are magically transformed into something Aladdin may have dined at back in his day.  The restaurant as a whole, is small for Vegas standards, though the dining room is one large room--predominantly red, with appropriate Moroccan decor.  Tables are very low to the ground and replicate a Moroccan dining experience.  With that, don't expect to have a lot of privacy from other parties.\n\nThis was a new experience for most of our party.  It was fun but, our waiter was rude.  Hopefully, you don't get him.  Otherwise, foodwise, ambiance, entertainment, and price I would've rated it four stars.  Our prix fixe meal was a mere $40ish per person.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Food, service, atmosphere......all fabulous!", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I've been driving by this place for years, and after a Groupon popped up offering two-for-one on the Six-Course Prix Fixe menu, I knew it was time to give it a go!\n\nWalking into the restaurant was a surprise itself! This place is located in a strip mall off of Paradise, nothing too exciting...yet the interior is absolutely beautiful. Decorations cover the walls, low tables are in the room, fabric drapes from the ceiling with lanterns dangling as well. The room is lit very dimly as well...this is an ideal place for a date, albeit a costly one.\n\nThe night started with a Moroccan hand-washing ceremony, where the server poured a jug of rose water over Dana and I's hands. It was a neat little touch, and the water left our hands smelling great and feeling clean :)\n\nI'll list the courses in order and talk about each...\n\n1) Sauteed Mushrooms w/ Wine, Oil and Garlic Sauce - We opted to substitute this for the Shrimp Scampi as Dana and I don't eat shrimp. The sauce was tasty, although super garlic-ey. Dana thought the mushrooms weren't cooked enough, and to be fair, they didn't look like they had been sauteed at all. We used an entire loaf of the sesame bread they give you at the table just eating the garlic sauce.\n\n2) Harira Soup - This soup was excellent, and tasted more or less like Tomato soup. It had a nice flavor and was served extremely hot.\n\n3) Marrakech Sampler - This plate included Hummus, Zaaluck (Tomato/Eggplant dip), Olives and Carrots. Neither of us like Hummus, so we skipped out, but I thought the Zaaluck was extremely tasty. Dana thought the marinated carrots were alright, but neither of us found the olives very tasty.\n\n4) Beef Brochette - This dish consisted of two beef kabobs that were stabbed into the side of a pineapple. The meat was extremely tasty and included some roasted onions and peppers. I had thought the meat would be much more seasoned and found it somewhat less tasteful than I would have liked, but it was still wonderful.\n\n5) Couscous Platter w/ Chicken - This dish was a pretty big platter and included some cabbage and other veggies mixed in with the Couscous and Chicken. They also gave us an extra container full of chicken broth to add to our food for more flavor. The chicken was amazing. It feel right off of the bone and nearly melted in our mouths. The couscous was cooked perfectly and even the cabbage tasted great as the flavor of the dish overall rubbed into it. \n\n6) B'Stilla - This was the dessert item, and neither Dana or myself particularly enjoyed it. It's a pastry stuffed with fruits and nuts and topped with powdered sugar and cinnamon. The mint tea that came with it was AWESOME though.\n\nI also must say that this restaurant has great entertainment in the belly dancing. I've seen many belly dancers, and normally they're not particularly attractive, but the one at Marrakech is gorgeous AND very talented. She had people getting up and dancing with her in the middle of the restaurant, which made for much laughter. \n\nOverall, this place is worth at least one visit. I wouldn't have gone before simply because $40 per person is a little more than I'd be willing to pay for this.

I'd wanted to check it out for a while because of the belly.... I mean the favorable food reviews that it gets here on Yelp and for the promise of hips, er, dips, skewers of meat, and bread that I'd read about here.  \n\nFirst things first, we were greeted warmly upon entry and seated.  The seating structure took me by surprise a little as we were right next to another group that seemed a little too close for my usual standards of comfort.  In a restaurant the further I'm seated away from the next table generally the better I feel.  Anti social behavior FTW!  Luckily another friend took the spot closest to the next table, and I breathed a sigh of relief.  The handwashing ceremony was nice, even though my friends and I made fools of ourselves trying to figure out exactly how to participate.\n\nWe each decided to try some different specialty cocktails from the menu during the meal, and personally I found them too sweet for the most part and therefore disappointing.  At $10 a pop I expected a little more out of them, but I should have known to just stick with what I tend to like.  That's what I get for being adventurous in my libations  \n\nWe each did the 6 course prix fixe meal.  The following is the 130th recap of all 6 of those that exists here:\n\n1)  Shrimp Scampi - I liked this a lot.  The shrimp tasted fresh and there were plenty to be shared between all of us.   Accompanying it was a huge plate of fresh bread that tasted great dipped in the Scampi sauce or with the shrimp on it\n\n2)  Lentil soup - Decent, nothing I would order again a la carte.  It was tomato based which is not normally my preference\n\n3)  Hummus and eggplant dip - I love hummus and this wasn't my favorite I've had by any means but I enjoyed it still.   I dont really like veggies so I'm disregarding that there were some on this plate\n\n4)  MEAT ON A STICK.  Beef skewers sticking out of a pineapple.   I don't have to get it to know that these were delicious.   For the 4th plate in a row, bread was not spared and in fact we asked for a 2nd plate of it to be brought out during this.   Moral of story:  bread goes with damn near everything in life\n\n5)  Chicken with couscous.   I liked this more than the rest of my party I think.  I tend to like anything that consists of a grain like substance mixed in with various meat and veggies.  I also got a giant chunk of chicken skin in with one of the bites which would have only been more delicious if it was fried.  Bread used with this?   You betcha.\n\nPrior to the 6th plate being brought out, we got some hot tea that they pour from like 3 stories up high into a small cup.   Showoffs.   Once it cooled down, I thought it was very nice.\n\n6)  Some chocolate/banana pastry dish.   I rarely order dessert on my own, but when it's placed in front of me I'm like a moth to a flame.   Tastes exactly as it sounds, which is a good thing.   No bread used for the first time in the night.\n\nI shouldn't eat carbs again for a month.\n\nWhen it was all said and done, I enjoyed the meal a lot.   I didn't dislike any of the six dishes and highly enjoyed 4 of the 6 plus the tea and bread.\n\nService was fine, though there was a weird moment in the beginning when the waiter asked if we had any allergies, and I told him I was lactose intolerant.  I'm not sure if his face expressed more confusion or annoyance but I believe he made a comment to the effect of \"We don't use lactose\"   My entire party thought this was what he said, which I just found completely bizarre, and I'd bet the Scampi and dessert both had some sort of butter or milk involved in the preparation.   I brought lactaid so it wasnt a big deal, but I guess I didn't really understand the interaction.  Nothing worth docking any stars.\n\nI'd be remiss to not mention the dancers, both of whom I thought were very entertaining and not intrusive if you didn't want them to be.  Unless you're a stick in the mud it'd be hard to not enjoy yourself here on at least that level of watching them interact with the crowd.  \n\nGreat experience overall.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "This restaurant is in a strip mall and much smaller than their photos depict.

Seriously, what muscles do these girls have that I don't?! Sugar honey iced tea.\n\nSo I'm going to give you a disclaimer for the meal that I wish had been there for me to see when I had dined there this Saturday: do NOT have a 6 course meal if you plan on going clubbing later that evening. Just don't do it. Why? Well, after 6 delicious courses you will have no other desire but to curl up into a ball and slip into the inevitable food coma. Nothing else. No really, nothing else. \n\nThat being said, the fare at Marrakech was heavenly. Here's a detailed course by course recap of our FEAST:\n\n1st Course - Moroccan Style Shrimp Scampi (sauteed in lemon, wine and garlic): I could not get enough of this dish. We were given two plates of shrimp for the four of us and it was such a great serving. I could not get enough of the sauce and kept dipping my bread in it to munch on. I knew I  was a goner once half of my loaf was already in my belly at after this course.\n\n2nd Course - Harira Soup (lentil, rice, lemon and spices): I usually dislike lentils but I really enjoyed their version of this dish. The flavor of the lentils did not overpower the other flavors and I really appreciated the tomato-lemon essence. True it was probably 90 something degrees outside but I really did enjoy that hot cup of soup!\n\n3rd Course - Moroccan Sampler (hummus, zaaluk, Moroccan style olives, beets & carrots): Wow that was definitely homemade hummus. Wonderfully fresh with a hint of smokiness. We were given even MORE bread at this point (i.e. warm pita) to mop this up with. The zaaluk (eggplant tomato dip) was to die for as well.\n\n4th Course - Beef Brochette (marinated beef kabobs): Beef skewers served on a whole pineapple. Unfortunately I dropped two pieces of my kabob like a child but I really enjoyed my meat. It was a tad chewy but great seasoning.\n\n**Please note that by this course you should make sure that you have car arrangements figured out once you receive this entree otherwise you might be screwed FYI.**\n\n5th Course - Royal Moroccan Couscous Platter with Chicken (served the traditional way with heaps of vegetables including squash and cabbage): At this point we were totally dying. I think I had 4 bites of this dish and had to call it quits from fear of exploding. The chicken was tender and literally fell off the bone and the couscous were fluffy perfection. Our poor waiter thought we didn't like the food but we reassured him that we did. \n\n6th Course - B'Stilla (classic pastry filled with bananas, walnuts and chocolate covered with powdered sugar served with Moroccan mint tea): Basically this was a warm, flaky puff pastry filled with all of the above. \n\nThe voluptuous belly dancers entertained us about every half hour during our meal which was a great distraction from our constant noshing.\n\n\nOverall Marakech was a fantastic and AFFORDABLE dining experience in Las Vegas. Now I will reiterate that the food was great.. but the reason why this restaurant received 5 stars instead of 4 was because the amazing owner drove me and the rest of our party to the Palms after waiting outside his restaurant for an hour for a cab. He took pity on us and offered us the ride since we were sweet (unlike the other see you next Tuesdays that were also outside). What a gentleman! \n\nPlus, he's hot.

I booked the restaurant about a month ahead of time in order to make sure we could get in.  I had heard from a couple of friends that Marrakech was not to be missed, and they were right.  Marrakech Moroccan Restaurant was everything they had mentioned plus more!\n\nI have never been to Morocco, but I imagine that Marrakech gives a good representation of the cuisine in that country.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated with tapestries, inlaid tables, low to the ground couches, and gorgeous belly dancers!!  They encourage you to eat with your fingers which is the traditional Moroccan way (although silverware is available if requested).  I have absolutely no problem with eating with my hands cause that is the traditional Filipino way also!  Before partaking of the six course meal, they wash your hands with rose water.\n\nThe six course meal is the same menu for everyone.  With the exception being a vegetarian menu for those who request it.  All of the courses tasted very good.  Starting from course #1 which was shrimp scampi all the way to course #6 which was the dessert.  The dessert is a Moroccan pastry called b'stilla.  It is a yummy concotion of chocolate, banana, & nuts all inside the pastry.  It was a perfect end to the meal.  \n\nThe entertainment was the highlight of the evening at the restaurant.  Those belly dancers are fabulous.  They came out to dance twice during our time there.  Of course, I had to entertain the patrons also.  They had me do my belly dancing with them as well.  I must say that they put me to shame, but I got a loud applause (at least I think the applause was for me).  My wife loved my dancing, and I got to burn off some calories which is always a good thing!!  \n\nI highly recommend that you visit here if you're in Las Vegas.  The location is not far from the Strip.  The ambiance, service, and entertainment are top notch and worth 5 stars.  The six course meal is 4.5 stars and costs $40 per person.  I could not quite give them 5 stars for the food because I'm just not a real big couscous fan.  Although, my wife really enjoyed it.  Our time at Marrakech was truly a memorable and wonderful experience.  \n\nI do have one suggestion, though.  It would be terrific if they would offer a couple of other options for their prixe-fixe menu.  I'd love to taste other Morrocan delicacies on our next visit.

Bread was okay, nothing special, clearly purchased from a factory. Everything was underspiced and a little bland, which sucks because one of the things I love (and expect!) about food from this region is the flavor. The red wine I had was good, but not $11/glass good. Maybe $6.\n\nPros: kebabs were yummy, put a couple drops of lemon juice on them for a different flavor. Can't go wrong with hummus and cucumbers. The shrimp (though a bit tough) had a nice sauce. Dessert was yummy and went well with coffee (they give you mint tea, but ask for the coffee instead). Chicken was pretty good. Large portions, my party of 3 had plenty of food to go around. Decor was lovely and the dancing girls were a crowd pleaser. Service was spot on.\n\nI think this was once a nice restaurant experience with authentic food, but management was losing money or wanted to make more money so they cut corners with the food. Typical, but sad. Marrakesh, make a fresh soup and your own bread. Stop outsourcing. Add a little love and flavor into the food. You're not doing yourselves any favors by Americanizing your menu.

The Marrehech mojito is no joke, by the way.  I probably should not have had the second one, but it was so tasty.\n\nThe prefix menu is a crazy amount of food.  A couple of recommendations.  First, eat a baby size lunch that day before going in.  When you get the first course of shrimp scampi, despite the deliciousness of the homemade bread, stop yourself from completely gobbling it all down.  You have a long way to go and if you go too hard at the beginning courses, the main course will arrive and you will have no room!\n\nThe shrimp was perfectly cooked.  Well seasoned and a good texture.  The second course of the veggies with the hummus was good.  The hummus was the best part.

Often meals from this region are lengthy multiple courses that involve desserts and then coffee so sitting without much support can become uncomfortable or distracting from the food and the experience which is meant to be drawn out and savored.  \n\nNot only is the atmosphere amazing, the food is delightful.  My dish, whose real name I admittedly cannot recall, was lamb with prunes served over rice.  I substituted rice for couscous which I always find rather mundane.  The lamb was very tender and juicy and the combination of that at the prunes was surprisingly delicious.  My partner got a b'stilla, I remember that one, which is a very unique creation.  It's a flakey pie stuffed with shredded meat and vegetables with the outer layer being sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon, amazing flavor combination.  The meal also came with a nice soup, a lentil and a chicken and beans both of which were also quite nice.  \n\nOverall, my experience at the Casbah was well-rounded and solid.  With gorgeous dcor and really fresh flavors in exotic dishes.  The service was also quite courteous from host, waitress, manager, even the cook from the behind the bar waived to us.  It was one of the few times I've felt like I was actually being treated, in every sense of the word, to a exquisite meal, as if I was a foreign dignitary.  This brought the whole evening together making the Casbah a truly enjoyable and complete experience.\n\nUPDATE:  I went back to eat here about a year after the above and the food wasn't as fantastical.

We ate there a couple of weeks ago with a friend who is vegan, and therefore made very sure to let the waiter know that she did not want a particular side that included yogurt.  When they brought up the plates, hers had the yogurt dish on it.  She very pleasantly explained the problem to the waiter, who took her plate away and returned about 10 minutes later... with visible traces of the yogurt still on the plate, around the side with which they had replaced it.  She did eventually get a plate that had not been contaminated (as far as we know), but if you had, say, a serious food allergy I would NOT trust the Casbah waitstaff not to kill you.\n\nThe food is excellent--well-seasoned and the meat is always succulent, and their rice and couscous have lovely flavor.

Avoid.)\n\nThe $$ price category fits, but just barely--I find that a dinner for two, with one of us drinking, generally runs us about $65 once you add on the tip.

I am a huge fan of Middle Eastern food, and consider myself to have discerning tastes.  My favorite places include the now shuttered Sabuddy's and Middle Eastern Bakery and Cafe in Phoenix.  I have always thought there was a huge opportunity for a restaurant to remake and redefine Middle Eastern food like Chipotle has done to Mexican food.  Hummus Xpress appears to be taking on the challenge.\n\nUpon arrival on Friday around 12pm my friend and I were warmly greeted by who I assume to be the owner and entrepreneur and another line cook.  Now imagine Chipotle: Before us were about 30 different Middle Eastern salads, sides, sauces, hummus to choose from.  You start by picking your menu option: pita, salad, or plate, I believe were the options.  Then you choose your meat.  They had grilled, marinated chicken, beef, gyro, and vegetarian.\n\nI picked the plate and started to load up.   I got a mixture of cooked brocolli, cauliflower, and zuchini, eggplant, purple kale, regular hummus, pickles. jalapenos, tabouli, cucumber, and turkish salad.  My meat selection was gyro and chicken based on the owner's suggestion.  There were about 15 things that I couldn't fit on the plate including a couple rices options, cous cous, several different hummus, lots of sauces, almonds, raisins, olives, you get the point.  I also ordered a side of falafel. The owner was very gracious and offered to let us sample anything before adding it to the plate.  I declined knowing that this place was for real.\n\nThe food was magnificent.  All of the vegetables were cook and seasoned well.  All of the salads and sides were incredibly fresh and tasty.  The meat was delicious.  The portion were huge.  I was stuffed upon leaving.  The only thing I didn't care for was the falafel.  They were prepared fresh, but they were too dense, and the tahini wasn't right.  I couldn't tell you exactly what was wrong with them, but if you want proper falafel and tahini go to Middle Eastern Bakery and Cafe.\n\nOverall, though, the restaurant is an amazing concept that I believe will satisfy many discerning fans of Middle Eastern food.  It will satisfy herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores alike.  The quality and value is top notch.  And I think the concept is a winner, and I would like to be the first investor!\n\nBest wishes to the owner and team at Hummus Xpress.

This place is tucked into a strip mall that, for whatever reason, I have never had occasion to visit despite living 1/4 mile from it for the majority of my adult life. Although strip mall is generally depressing (it's next to an MMJ doctor and a dry cleaner) the atmosphere is clean and modern if a bit stark. \n\nA reviewer below mentioned that this is sort of a middle eastern Chipotle, which is a useful comparison. You basically chose a bowl, a pita, or a platter. Each option entitles you to a certain number of meats (or vegetables) and an unlimited number of toppings. The proprietor is more than friendly and guides you through the process, perhaps a bit too thoroughly, but it's great to see an engaged small business owner who cares about his product. \n\nThe food is outstanding. I'm a vegetarian and my girlfriend is vegan and there were plenty of options. Every filling was extremely flavorful in a non-cloying way. Sometimes the prospect of eating vegetables and hummus leaves something to be desired, but dishes like the roasted eggplant, cous cous, and the various hummuses (hummusi?) were so interesting and complex that I was excited to go back and try the dishes I missed. \n\nI would have given the place 4 stars if not for one quibble - VEGAN TAX. Allow me to explain. Some establishments, this one included, do not deduct a dollar (or two) for omitting meat from the meal. There is no way that hummus costs as much as lamb, so in theory, a vegetarian bowl should reflect the difference in price. Instead of reducing the price accordingly, places that charge the same essentially profit from the difference between the cost of a meat dish and that of a vegan dish. In my opinion, this shouldn't be passed off on vegans/vegetarians, and essentially operates as a tax on vegans. If the guy lowered the price of a veggie pita/bowl/platter, I would go here more often.\n\nVegan tax aside, the food is great and fresh and the staff is nice.

I would be hard-pressed to pick a favorite. This one is right up there at the top of the list. In fact, I may just go ahead and make a list. \n\nThe way you order here is similar to eating at Chipotle or Q-doba, but instead of tortillas you're getting a pita and different fixings... except cheese.

The service is friendly and quick. And of course, the food is fresh and absolutely delicious. Since you get to pick what you want to eat, if you don't like it - it's pretty much your fault. I had a pita with beef and fixings, while my girlfriend had a chicken plate (which also comes with a pita, but you get extra protein). We both ate ourselves stuffed. \n\nThis strip used to be kinda dead - this spot used to be an always-empty Chinese place where the owner didn't give a shit anymore, but the new owner cleared out all remnants of what it used to be and transformed it into something great.

At the risk of the yelp*ing community throwing themselves off Camelback mountain, I have to say that Pita jungle sort of sets the bar for me when it comes to overall taste, portion size, and quality.  Having said that, I was fortunate to try Hummus Xpress (hard to take the place serious with the name) this afternoon.  Based on the reviews alone, I was expecting a lot and was not disappointed. Live music, handful of tables, not much of a line and fairly straightforward system of ordering.  If you read more than two other reviews, I don't have to repeat the process.  It was nice to get some guidance from the line, though I was a little confused by the pricing aspect: .60 cents per item on veggies.  I wasn't clear if that was across the menu or just that region but I was so aware of it that it kept me from really wanting to pile on anymore than a single veggie.  Portion size was adequate, the bowl can hold a lot of food and you fill the bowl easily with delicious ingredients.  I sampled a few flavors of hummus and too be honest, I prefer my hummus warm which this was not but was still tasty.  What seems like a limited menu actually is fairly vast and it would be possible to have the same thing twice only by accident.  Pitas were soft and warm and the iced tea was special.  Push-button iced tea is an abomination so it was nice to see handwritten exotic flavors that didn't make you roll your eyes.

I had the gyro meat and I honestly think it's the best gyro meat I've had in Tempe so far. Super moist and flavorful and it didn't give me indigestion! The hummus was really good, I had the plain one (If someone can't make plain hummus right, then there is no point in trying the flavored ones) It was good!!! I asked if it was made in house or bought, they told me everything is made in house.\n\nEven the drinks were exciting! I had lavender-peach tea. It was fresh and I loved that it wasn't sweetened.

It was a light opener and one item to consider for those looking for soups. \n\nThe Baba Ghannouge ($4.99) came with baked eggplant, sesame sauce, garlic, and lemon.

This place is truly unique to Las Vegas as we do not have another Moroccan restaurant here, (Marrakech is faux Moroccan, sorry). This place is tucked away in a strip mall behind Outback, little difficult to find if you're not familiar with this center. \n\nWe started out with a bottle of Moroccan wine, not on the menu, but just ask, it was really good, if you like Cabs, you will like this wine. \n\nAmeen, our waiter had suggested we start out with the Calamari Steak appetizer as well as the Pastilla. The presentation of both was so pretty, I didn't want to ruin it by eating it! The Calamari was so tender and soft, it melted in your mouth, the flavors of lemon and the chickpea relish really made this dish different from any other way I've had calamari. The Pastilla was almost like dessert, I love sweet and savory and this dish nailed it. Layers of filo dough around chicken and egg with almond, dusted with cinnamon. It was delicious.  \n\nI love Tangine cooking, the meat is so tender and the flavors of the spices come bursting through the food. We tried two different dishes, Braised Short Rib and Mechoui Roasted Lamb. Both dishes were equally amazing, and very unique. The Short Ribs were so tender, the meat literally fell apart with a fork, the flavors were so evident, seasoned with cinnamon and honey, marcona almonds and dried apricots. This is served with Khobz, or Moroccan bread, to dip into the juices left in the Tangine.\nThe Lamb Tangine was so good, seasoned with Sharmoula, a spice similar to cumin, and served with Harrisa, which is a condiment, the brilliant color of orange would make you think it is made with carrots, but it gets to color from roasted red peppers and smoked paprika. This is also served with fresh mint, the combination of the flavors were great. \n\nWe finished dinner with Mint Tea Almond Panna Cotta, very unique, not sweet at all and more of a citrus flavor.\n\nOn Fridays and Saturdays starting at 6:30 they have belly dancing, we caught a few songs, and she was really good! \n\nThis place was truly amazing, I can't wait to return.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 6, "cool": 6}}, {"text": "Great babaganosh and delicious shrimp also great tangines.

The calamari steak is a must order item, and I also highly recommend any shrimp dish, the lamb sausage, the appetizer of mixed dips, the braised chard (not what it seems!), and the panna cotta. I would gladly reorder any item I've had there, with the exception of the mussels. The flavor was great, but for some odd reason they choose to use the frozen green lip mussels rather than fresh. \n\nMy one concern, other than the place being hard to find and therefore not attracting a lot of drive-by traffic, is that I think the chef is temporary. He is apparently a big wig chef in Morocco (which if you ever meet him he will inform you of in typical chef fashion), and his friend owns the place. I hope the quality will be maintained when he leaves.\n\nCurrently I would place Argana as one of my favorite off Strip restaurants in Vegas, and would suggest it to even the most discriminating foodies.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 4, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "We happened upon this place by accident and I'm so glad that we did!\n We had read the Yelp reviews as we were sitting in the car deciding whether or not to go in. Most of the reviews raved about the calamari steak, so of course, we had to try it! We ordered the calamari steak appetizer and it was easily one of the best things I've eaten in a long time. Not only was it delicious,  but it was also very beautifully presented. \nNow, on to the main dishes... My husband ordered the chicken tagine.  The chicken was so tender and juicy and the sauce was so yummy. I ordered the chicken brochette,  which is basically a kabob.  Once again, the chicken was tender and juicy and the spices that it was cooked with gave it a great flavor. It also came with saffron rice, potatoes and an incredibly yummy tomato topped with parmesean cheese and spices. For dessert,  we ordered the panna cotta. It had a great citrus flavor and was very refreshing- the perfect ending to an amazing meal!\nWe also ordered a bottle of the Moroccan wine, which perfectly complimented the flavors of our meal. At $45/bottle,  it was totally worth it.\nThe staff was just as great as the food.
