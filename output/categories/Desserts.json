Lil' Brown Sugars also just opened up a few days ago. It's cute little bakery/cafe.  Clean, brightly lit.  I was greeted by the nice lady behind the counter who thanked us for coming in and supporting local businesses and the young man who helped me today was friendly & helpful as well. \n\nThere is a small variety of cupcakes and cake pops to choose from. You can also purchase them individually  and order some as well. They also have bagels and make sandwiches. One other customer was in there dining at their lil bistro table and commented how awesome the sandwiches were, but my tasted buds were set on havin' me some sugar!!  \n\nSo my first visit I tried the Peanut Butter/Chocolate cupcake and Red Velvet cake pop.  The flavors of the peanut butter one were right on..the buttercream frosting flavor reminded me of a Reeses Peanut Butter Cup.  Cake was dense/moist and the ratio of frosting and cupcake was perfect..not too much, not too little.  There are some good combo of flavors to choose from.   I just dropped by and  I picked up a Strawberry Lemonade and Orange Dreamsicle cupcake and a Caramel/coconut /chocolate cake pop..just like GS Samoas cookies.   Cake pops are perfect size for me because they satisfy my sugar craving without sending me into sugar shock and they only set you back $1.60.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Gold Dust Woman\n\nDamn I really hate being THAT guy.  You know, the last on one the bandwagon...before everyone else has already jumped off because it's going down in flames.  Well, because of Lil Brown Sugar's Cupcakes, I officially jumped on board (feel free to exit the cabin at any time).\n\nOver the past 3 weeks, I've sampled probably a dozen flavors and all of them were absolutely spot on.  First of all, if you've read any of my reviews of cupcake places (if not, I will find you and tape your eyelids open), I don't like frosting.  Yeah, I'm odd like that, but my kids love that they get an extra dose of kiddy crack.  These are the only cupcakes where I absolutely cannot pass up the frosting.  They capture the essence of the flavor in the frosting, like how Jelly Belly does in a jelly bean.  Seriously!  Here's a rundown:\n\n1.  Key Lime - Hold your butt cheeks together otherwise you'll shit yourself.  The frosting tastes like a fluffy key lime pie.  Well, not \"like\" a key lime pie...EXACTLY like one.  I actually ate the frosting before the cupcake.  It so light and fluffy it feels like there aren't any calories, just angel dust.  The cupcake itself had a hint of lime, which was nice, but really, it was second fiddle to the frosting.\n\n2.  Butter Beer - I think this was butterscotch cake batter mixed with cream soda topped with butterscotch frosting.  I'm not a fan of butterscotch, but the flavors were so rich and flavorful.  The cake was a little too dense for my wife's taste, but exactly how I like it.  \n\n3.  Peanut Butter Cup - It was a chocolate cupcake with a Hershey Kiss baked inside, topped with peanut butter frosting.  I hate peanut butter, so this wasn't my cup of tea because it tasted exactly like a peanut butter cup (duh).  On the other hand, my wife and mother-in-law thought this was their favorite of all.\n\n4.  Strawberry Lemonade - One of my favorites.  The cupcake is a strong lemon flavor.  Not tart and not sweet.  Just easily identifiable as lemon.  The frosting was on the sweeter side, so I did scrape off about half, but it perfectly complemented the cupcake to the point where it really did taste like a mild strawberry lemonade.  \n\n5.  Orange Dreamsicle - Just like when Ego eats the ratatouille, my hanabata days memories of eating a Meadow Gold orange dreamsicle came rushing back.  This cupcake was like eating a fluffy one, and without the brain freeze.  Of all the flavors I've tried, this is the most subdued, yet highly addictive.\n\n6.  Chocolate Covered Strawberry - Exactly as described, a chocolate cupcake with strawberry frosting.  Not quite the most memorable, but not too shabby either.  The fact that the frosting is mixed with FRESH strawberries gets points from me.\n\n7.  S'mores - Dude.  Totally tastes like a s'more.  And nowhere near as sweet as a real one.  Chocolate (maybe it was Devil's Food) cupcake with marshmallow whip frosting, topped with crushed graham cracker.  My family still raves about this one.  \n\n8.  Thin Mint Cake Pop - When the lady behind the counter told me it tastes like a Thin Mint, she wasn't kidding.  Sans the snap of the cookie, this thing is choco-minty goodness.  Get two of these and you almost have a box of the real thing.  \n\n9.  Sugar Cookies - I buy these for my rug rats.  Haven't been able to taste them because they're usually gone.  I guess that means they're pretty good.\n\n10.  Red Velvet - Tastes like red velvet.  Although it is exactly as described, I would have to say this is the most boring flavor offered (this statement comes from a guy who LOVES red velvet.  I'm the guy who bought my wife a red velvet birthday cake because hell, if I like it, she better like it too (right?)).  I suggest you do yourself a favor and try anything else in the case.\n\nI would argue that these tasty nuggets don't contain brown sugar.  No, they must have been sprinkled with some gold dust because I'm ready to dig in with my silver spoon.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 11, "useful": 19, "cool": 13}}, {"text": "I was excited to finally try Lil Brown Sugar cupcakes after reading the reviews.

Of course, my first thought is \"It must be good!\" She still had some Red Velvets, Strawberry Lemonades, and one lonely Triple Chocolate Cupcake left. We request one of each, except the Red Velvet. Other items there were chocolate chip cookies, gooey bars, and brownies. \n\nHow did the cupcakes taste? AMAZING! I can't remember the last cupcake that was as moist and tasteful. I'm one of those cupcake eaters who only like a tiny bit of frosting, however, this frosting was great. Not overly sweet and overpowering. She told us the Strawberry Lemonade was her most popular, and now I can see why. What was I thinking, just getting one?!?! \n\nI'll definitely be back to try her other flavors, including the red velvet.

I was not expecting a such a pungent punch in my mouth. I usually eat the frosting then the cake. This definitely tastes good with both together. \n\nStrawberry Shortcake was good also. The frosting was not over bearing in way that it was too thick. The flavor and density were really good. It tasted like a strawberry puree which went very well with the cake. \n\nCake Batter is always a favorite. I can eat cake batter for days if there wasn't such a risk. So eating cake flavored cake batter will have to do. It tastes just like cake batter and i think theres sprinkles or something in the frosting. Very good. \n\nVery Vanilla was my least favorite. It didn't taste like vanilla to me, but I still ate it. Frosting on the cake was very light.  My mom loves vanilla flavor, so she liked it. \n\nSo my assumption of over priced goodies was wrong. The cupcakes are reasonably priced. When I bought mine, they were $2.60 each, which isn't bad at all. They also have cake pops (when you check in you get a free one). There are also bars like an ooey gooey bar that I'm going to try on my next visit.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 4, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "I live in 'old' Henderson, which some people realize, the boutique style cupcake cafes are very scarce 'round these parts.

The shop itself is nothing special, but the service was very friendly, and I loved that the owners (I think) 2 kids were there - 1 working the register and 1 doing his homework.  The cupcake selection was pretty good, with about 7-8 flavors available. They offered some of the standards: red velvet, cake batter, coconut, and a few more interesting flavors: cherry limeade, smores, drumstick, and a couple others I didn't ask about. I sampled the smores, cherry limeade, and strawberry shortcake, and they were all excellent. The flavors were spot-on for the names, the cake stayed moist until the next day, and the frosting was creamy. I loved the marshmallow frosting of the smore cupcake, but I did think the strawberry/limeade frostings were just a tad too sweet for my liking. No worry, I just scraped off a little of the extra.\nI also tried a couple of their other items - a gooey bar and a peanut butter bar. The gooey bar is kind of like a gooey cheesecake with a crust on top and bottom. It is extremely rich, and it took me 3 servings to finish it, but it's definitely good. The peanut butter bar was a chocolate chip cookie bar with peanut butter icing. I didn't realize the icing was peanut butter until they'd already bagged it for me (pb is not my fave), but the bar was still really good, even with the icing.\nOn top of all that, they have an additional yelp deal - free cake pop with cupcake purchase.

Well there was some issues with coverage and making the cake for when I needed, which I totally understand, but it was 5 days after I  wanted to order so it was enough time to figure out.

I went in to pay ahead of time so that she didn't have to worry about it and confirmed what I was looking for and told her how important this cake was. She assured me that the lady decorating would be great with the design as she deals with kids my son's age. So I put my trust in them. Well I picked up the cake and it was suppose to be a sheet cake and it was round. I was a little annoyed that it wasn't what was said but that wasn't a big deal. The design is what upset me. It was as basic could be (something I easily could have done or u could walk into walmart and not even order and just pick up something that looked like it.) the figures were just placed on top and that was it.

The woman who handed it to me did call her to let her know I was disappointed and I talked to her on the phone. Nothing in that call was resolved.

Well...that's probably fair enough, but you have to have some incentive to aim for when you're killing yourself running round the court.\n\nS Luca is always busy, busy, and lunch time sees an influx of mothers, children, and babies, although you do get students from the university up the road too. The children running about and the babies wailing I'm not so keen on, being the most not maternal individual of all time, sorry if that sounds harsh, but it's just an honest reaction. This doesn't take away from the fact that the food is tasty, with a great lunch menu served in the cafe upstairs, from sandwiches, paninis and soups, plus there's the ever appealing option of tucking in to an ice cream from the gelateria downstairs.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "all I can say is WOW\n\nYou need to come here, seriously, it's amazing.\n\nYolanda, the owner, is nothing short of brilliant.

I wanted to go back and buy another one, but I didn't want to be a piggy.\n\nNext visit was a fresh fruit bread pudding! Real cranberries, nothing frozen or dehydrated here, baked into a luscious pudding that melted in your mouth!\n\nOn our last visit just a couple of weeks ago, we got a variety of treats. A pear and chocolate galette, chocolate croissants, and a blueberry and strawberry danish. Everything was spot on.\n\nThankfully my boyfriends folks live in Madison so I have an excuse to come here on a monthly basis!

Tucked in the back of a strip mall, it's also a major supplier to casinos across the city- so you may have already had the rolls- maybe you've seen the funny depiction of a well endowed backside/buns on a baker/mascot, on the delivery trucks. Closed sunday. Day old bread is marked down on a tall rack on your right as you enter the bakery (so cheap, making it harder to resist). Different size buns, assorted rolls, baguettes, bagels, coffee cake, and assorted pastries are among the long list of available freshly baked goods. If you were planning to make sandwiches, the possibilities are endless. It's self service with the breads, complete with tongs, baggies, and ties. You get the pastries at the counter, where you pay. Also available here are black and white cookies (my husband likes this version better than Freed's)- but this one sells out pretty fast.\n\nThis is not the place for you if you're trying to avoid carbs. It's hard for us to buy bread in large quantities (unless we freeze it) since it's just the two of us. But it's great for large families, parties, especially a barbeque since it's budget friendly ($5 gets you a lot here). Get here early for the best selection (mon-sat 7 am to 5 pm) and know that this place is very popular with the older set- we're usually the youngest ones here, besides some staff. After all, it's the best place to get fresh baked bread in the entire city- non-Asian, anyway. The staff is busy but still remain friendly and pleasant.

For those, I used the off-brand ketchup that they serve prepackaged in Solo condiment cups with lids.\n\nClearly, the best part was the shake.

I've lived in Chandler since 1999 and was thrilled to see this place opening up fairly close to my neighborhood.\n\nThis is what a real milkshake is, people. Ice cream, milk and flavored syrup, mixed on a shake mixer, not some synthetic concoction made in a refrigerated piece of machinery. \n\nThe food here is good, the milkshakes are incredible. The service has been hit and miss at times, but generally okay. Make sure you get the fry sauce with your fries or onion rings for the \"authentic\" Iceberg experience. For a real treat, order your burger topped with pastrami and you will know true flavor on a bun.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "So....this place is in no way terrible...but also in no way is it great.\n\nThe pluses:\n* The \"mini\" sized milkshake is the size of a bucket. I was anticipating a DQ sized mini blizzard. Not so my fellow ice cream lovers. You will NEED to share this with someone. Or face the consequences of gaining 12 pounds instantly.\n* Service was friendly.\n* They offer sweet potato fries.\n\nThe minuses:\n* No vegetarian option. C'mon...no veggie burger?? They offer a kids grilled cheese.\n* The young man who took our order was...well, young and got distracted easily and confused about the menu items, which thoroughly confused me when ordering.\n* The restaurant was not well kept. The dining area looked as if it hadn't been cleaned in a day. We ended up lightly cleaning our own table before sitting down.\n* The bathrooms...well...not clean. Waste of washing my hands.\n\nProbably won't be back personally, but if the cons were rectified, could be an ok place for the High School crowd.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "We love the shakes!

The ordering is a little strange, since double burgers are not listed.  You have to order a regular burger and then add an extra patty.

The onion rings are pretty large and in-charge with a massive crunch.  Fry sauce that comes with the sides is tasty... similar to ketchup and mayo mixed.  Couldn't really detect any extra spices on the \"home fries\", but they were scarfable nonetheless.\n\nI'll be back to try the shakes, as it seems like this is what Icebergs is known for.\n\nAnd I'll probably pop in for another \"iceburger\" sometime.

It was supposed to be a mini but apparently they over made it and dropped the smaller cup into a large cup and filled it the rest of the way. .

I told her we got a cheesecake but it tasted weird like caramel. She looked at it then back at me and goes, \"Uh, it isn't caramel.\" Looking basically disgusted she turned her back to me. Well it ended up being a butterscotch (we realized this once we got to the end and saw the syrup) but that whole experience was just irritating.
