Boo. Ice cream on the bottom tasted like that synthetic cheap ice cream, you no waaay processed. Ick. The syrup that drained from the top was pooled and concentrated on the bottom in tasted like cheap koolaid.  in short, cheap syrup and ice cream, basicly clumpy hard crushed ice, wasnt impressed.\n\nWent to Sno Shack again to refresh my taste memory and refresh myself from the blazing Vegas sun. This guy has the REAL DEAL \"Snow\" machine that actually \"shaves\" the ice giving it that soft texture of fluffy snow. Fluffy snow means syrup stays evenly spread throughout the sno. Owner Jackie told me he gets his syrup from Hawaii and definitally taste deliciously yummy and DEFINITLY NOT KOOLAID like the other cheapo ice. Ice cream was real ice cream flavor,  no skimping,here! :)  Azuki beans and sno cap made the whole thing a creamy, smooth, fluffy sweet mountain of YUM!  \n\nEven as a hawaiian shaved ice novice, i can, definitly see and taste the difference between REAL \"shaved\" ice and sub par \"crushed\" ice.
