Great movie, not a great experience here.  When we walked in and sat at a table in the bar we were promptly greeted by the bartender and placed our order.

I figured this might be a nice place to hang out.  \n\nWell, it went down hill from there.  My lovely wife decided that we should split a sampler platter so we did.  Our food came out within about 10 minutes.  The \"platter\" was a small basket containing the following: 3 onion rings, 3 mozzarella sticks, 3 potato skins and 3 stuffed peppers.  The quality was on the order of the freezer section at frys......    The price on this was $11.99!   Now, I could be a little more understanding if it was $5.99.....\n\nSo....   We ate and worked on drinking our pitcher as it started to rain.  I then made a visit to the bathroom which was filthy and without paper towels.   I returned to my seat in the bar and watched the platinum blond, that appears to be known by most of the customers, as she tried to find someone that might be willing to take her home for the night.  \n\nI guess my opinion would be that this place is not worth a return visit.  \n\nI am certain that we can find a better place to spend our money in the future!", "review_stars": 1, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I feel obligated to write this review because this was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had.\n\nMy sister, mom, grandmother and I went out to have an afternoon drink on our day off.

They were tasty so we decided to have one more.  After having to GET UP to find the waitress (we were the ONLY patrons in the dining area) she brought our second round, only one mistake this time, and my salad.  \n\nI had to find the waitress AGAIN to ask for our check.  When I checked it out I found that they had added .50 for the dressing.  I know this sounds dumb, but who the hell charges for dressing for a SALAD???  Come on guys, if your that broke just shut your doors.\n\nWhen I went to hand her the check (Yes, I had to find her again) I complained about the charge.  Amazingly enough she brought the bill back out, but without the credit card that I had put in it.  I asked her where it was and she didn't know.  We looked around for a couple of minutes and still couldn't find it.  After my sister said aloud that she was going to call the company and report it lost did the cook walk PAST our table to miraculously find the card on the floor.

The location I stupidly decided to go to last night was the one attached to the Fiesta Mall in Mesa.  It's new.  And it's fucking gross. \n\nOn our way home from work I told the boyfriend we should check out somewhere new for happy hour simply because I needed a new Yelp review to write.  He was reluctant to try this shit hole, pressuring me to simply enjoy a few beers at Casey Moore's instead of wanting something \"new.\"\n\n\"But I need to yelp.\"\n\nWalking into Buffalo Wings and Rings is sad and disappointing and you already know it's going to suck.  There was no one in the place and the decor consists of sports jersey's thumb tacked to a wall and three or four dated flat screen TV's showing a bunch of bullshit no one is watching.  'Cause no one is there. \n\nWe're greeted by a faux punk rock chick with a horrible fire engine red dye job which was unflattering for that A-Line haircut she paid too much for at Tony and Guy.  She was obviously new to the whole \"serving\" thing which is probably why she was working on a Wednesday night when everyone was watching the premier of American Idol.  We asked if we could sit outside as the inside was dreary and unwelcoming, like my Grandpa's house on Christmas. \n\nBuffalo Wings and Rings has the ugliest and most uncomfortable plastic, grade school-esque chairs I've ever seen.  The tables are also ugly, plastic, wobbly and adorned with tree droppings and uncleaned ashtrays.  \n\nThe boyfriend gives me an \"I told you so\" look as we move around trying to find a clean table and one in which we're not getting hit with hot air by some weird, loud buzzing fan.  We finally settle at a sticky table with an uncleaned, smelly ashtray. \n\nI ask Faux Punk Server about their specials; 2.50 domestic pints, nothing good on draft, no food specials, no well specials.  I order a Michelob Ultra as I have little other choice.  We wait too long.  Faux Punk Server comes back, \"Oh, keg is empty, have to refill, can you wait?\"  \n\nWe wait longer, we get our beers.  We look at the shitty, over priced Buffalo Wild Wings rip off of a menu.  I hate the whole \"pick your flavor, then pick your heat\" thing they do at some wing places.  It seems odd and, um, retarded.  I order five sweet and sour with the \"atomic\" sauce, the boyfriend get original buffalo \"extra hot.\"\n\nI feel it necessary to mention that when we got our wings they all tasted exactly the same.  A thin layer of Frank's Red Hot on gross, old, frozen wings served in plastic bowls.  At one point I spit a piece out because it tasted like ground beef.  \n\nWe also had the pleasure of their \"signature item,\" Sloppy Fries.  These were frozen french fries served, again, in a giant plastic bowl covered with canned chili and fake nacho cheese.  It literally looked like a bowl of vomit.  Like, someone ate a bunch of McDonald's hamburgers and fries and then threw it up in a bowl and set it down on the table for us.  We ended up having this wrapped up so I could give it to my dog.  He liked it a lot.  But as the boyfriend later pointed out, \"he also licks his asshole a lot.\"  \n\nIronically, Faux Punk Server said as she sat them down, \"these look SO good.\"\n\nAs it turned out, nothing here was good or redeeming.  Even the server, though she tried her best, fumbled over her words, nervously took our plates and couldn't make eye contact.  The entire place reeked of low-ball, less than nothing American shit food and the emptiness of the dining area soon become the emptiness of my FUCKING SOUL as I dished out thirty bucks to spit shit out and bitch for an hour. \n\nAs we left the place I told the boyfriend he was right, we should have just gone to Casey Moore's and not given into my now costly desire to try something new for a stupid Yelp review.

So, one Saturday night, right before hitting up The Comedy Club on State, we decided to stop by Quaker Steak and Lube as a \"trial\". We were immediately greeted and seated with no wait.

The fries were seasoned to perfection and the ranch... YUM. It's hard to find a place that serves really great ranch. **So far Red Robin is #1 ranch server and Quaker Steak and Lube is now #2** My fiance ordered chicken wings. They tasted baked and then deep-fried. Their choice of sauces were practically limitless. There was a ton to choose from. My brother and his wife each ordered a burger and fries and a bowl of the cheesy baked potato soup. They were both very pleased with their meal. Our bill came to about $60 which wasn't bad for the four of us.

I tried a Custom Built Combo - Loaded Magna Fries and 6 pack of wings (original BBQ) and six more wings with Dusted Chipotle BBQ. I don't typically order dry rubs for wings or ribs (I know that's a popular Southern way). When they came out, the 'dusted' wings were hands down my favorite. I will go back again just to have those wings in that dusting.\n\nThe fries were good, initially, but as I got the remaining fries at the bottom, they became dry and less enjoyable.

We also sat waiting for refills a little long - especially after he came and asked if we wanted refills.\n\nWhen I got to my second to last wing, I thought 'wow, this is a big wing!' ...it wasn't a wing. In fact, I had no idea what it was (at the time). First bite - not a wing. Second bite - nothing but pepper (spit into napkin). I pointed it out to the waiter, not because I wanted something free or a new meal (I was full and got my money's worth). But I was really curious what it was.\n\nAs we were getting up to leave the manager rushed out with a free 6 pack of wings as an apology (again, not what I needed, but it was well welcomed). Turns out it was breading... nothing but breading. Yeah, that explains what I tasted.

I was a bit suprised at the cost to attempt the challenge (13.99 for three wings and a t-shirt if you succeed) so I opted to just order their all you can eat special and maybe get a few towards the end to see what they were like. So after a few orders of variously spicy wings I ended up at the level just below the atomic. At that point we had a bit of debate at the table which ended up with my skipping the atomic and going right to triple atomic.\n\n The waitperson let me know that there was an additional charge which was fine and he provided me with a waiver to sign. With the \"legal\" formalities out of they way they brought out my last order of wings with the triple atomic sauce, and  they even threw in a bonus wing! With a small amount of trepidation, I sniffed the sauce for the telltale chemical odor of capsaicin extract which can give you some pretty nasty chemical burns. It seemed to be ok so while everyone stared, I dug in, carefully avoiding my lips. Finished the first and waited a bit for it to sink in... not bad! Good slow build on the burn and a LOT of complex flavors. It was apparent that whomever developed the recipe was a spicy food lover as well. I finished the rest of the wings and settled back to enjoy the endorphin rush. \n\nI even got a little bit in a togo cup for a fellow chili head back home.

Overall, I had a good experience.  I ordered an individual combo online (8 classic wings with fries and a drink for about $8). I was given a pickup time of 25 minutes later. When I picked up my order (2 minutes after the pickup time), it was ready, and waiting on a small table just behind the cashier.  The cashier was fast, not overly friendly or peppy, but efficient and business like.  Not a huge turnoff, but not a stellar impression, either.  More important to me was that my order was ready on time, correct, and I was in and out quickly - all of which exceeded my expectations.\n\nThis location does *not* have the Coke Freestyle machine (as advertised at \"select locations\" on their website), by the way.  Fountain drinks included  Coke, Diet Coke (I think), some kind of punch, Minute Maid lemonade, Dr. Pepper and a couple of iced tea flavors (separate from the fountain dispenser).\n\nSo, the food.  I am one of those that can not deal with spicy foods, even fake spicy - like Taco Bell.  However, I do get cravings for honey wings, which most places do not have.  I first had them at Final Round (bar in Tempe), and the craving haunts me from time to time.  :-)  Wing Stop had a better flavor selection than most restaurants in my work area, including teriyaki and Hawaiian, so those are the two flavors I ordered.  I was not disappointed.  I had to try one of each of them right away (partially because I had been looking up wing joints for an hour previous to actually ordering and was more than ready to eat - partially to see if they were lukewarm from sitting out on a table prior to my arrival).  The temperature was perfect - nice and warm without being too hot to eat comfortably, the meat was juicy and tender, and the sauce was thick in consistency and applied liberally.  The Hawaiian wings had the honey flavor I was looking for with just a hint of pineapple in them.  The teriyaki wings tasted more soy saucey than most, and, as a result, were more salty than sweet.  Now, the fries.  Someone else wrote a review mentioning them, so I was forewarned.  It was a very strange experience eating them.  My taste buds were both intrigued and disgusted.  First it was sweet (ooooh!), then my brain kicked in and was like \"What?!? You're supposed to taste like potatoes and salt - not pancakes!\"  Suffice to say, all but 3 of the fries went to waste.  When I was able to sit down and eat the rest of the wings 25 minutes after my initial order pick up, the wings had maintained their perfect temperature, which is a big deal to me.\n\nIs Wing Stop my new favorite place?  No, just by virtue of their specialty (and limited menu as a result).  I did, however, have a good experience overall, and know where I can meet my honey wings craving during business hours.  Will I return?  Probably.  The Hawaiian wings hit the spot (next time I'm getting those only!), and I'll have no problem remembering to NOT get the fries again.\n\nHope this helps!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Tried this place for the first time last year after a long day of work at the near-by business.

The wings are always fried perfectly crispy, to order, And tossed in the sauce of your choice.

After several weeks of delays, it finally opened this past Saturday. I waited until Wednesday to stop by. Good news and bad news about this place. Lets start with the good. The chicken tastes great. It is very flavorful, with just a little amount of spice to it..And afterall, the chicken is why we go to a chicken place, right? The dirty rice and the fried okra were both pretty good as well. \n\n Now the not so good news- The chicken pieces were on the small size. I ordered a 3 piece mixed combo. I got a small wing, a small drumstick and a small thigh. The menuboard says the combos come with your choice of two sides. I chose dirty rice and fried okra. After paying and getting my receipt, I noticed that I was charged $7.19 while the menu said $6.99. I mentioned the difference in price, and was told it was because the okra is a more expensive side. I completely understand that, but shouldn't it be mentioned on the menuboard that some sides may require an upcharge? The \"bread\" that comes with the combos is a pretty standard, premade roll, similar to a Kings Hawaiian sweet roll.  The fried okra was freshly fried after I ordered it, but is probably straight out of the freezer bag. It was good. The dirty rice also was good, but nothing great.\n\nBottom line--would I return or recommend this place to others--Yes.. The chicken is very flavorful. I would try some different sides next time to see if they are better. They also offer some desserts such as cobbler, lemon cake, etc which I will try at another time. My biggest suggestion to them, if possible, would be to try to get a slightly larger sized chicken.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Bad news.

For sides, I ordered the sweet corn nuggets and mac and cheese. They had run out of mac and cheese and had to make more. It took about 10 minutes to make. Was it worth the wait? It was fresh, REAL macaroni and cheese, baked in the oven, not some \"out of the box\" variety. It was made with real cheese, as witnessed by the stringy cheese when eaten. My comment here is that I prefer a more creamy variety than what it was. But it definitely was better than Kraft mac & cheese in a box. \n\nThe sweet corn nuggets were incredible. Not sure if they are something they make fresh or if it comes out of a freezer bag, but they were delicious little morsels. Nuggets of corn kernals, surrounded by a light crunchy coating and deep fried. \n\nI wanted to try out their fried shrimp, so I got an \"add on\" of 4 fried shrimp ($1.99). At first view, I was disappointed. What I got were 4 very small (think MAYBE 45-50 sized shrimp). They were not even butterflied, which would have made them appear bigger).

Louisiana Fried Chicken falls somewhere in between the two, but you shouldn't scoff because it is AMAZING! \n\nPROS: The batter is crisp and doesn't slide off the entire piece of chicken when you take your first bite (I'm guessing it's a wet batter?), the chicken is well seasoned all of the way through, and best of all, the chicken isn't swimming in grease when it hits the box. The corn nuggets are TO DIE FOR and the dirty rice is spicy, well-seasoned, and pretty decent (although I prefer my own, wallowing in bacon grease...)

The mac and cheese takes 35 minutes to make so CALL AHEAD! It is well worth the wait. The noodles are perfectly al dente, the cheese blend is unbelievable, and the entire dish was immaculately seasoned.

They were amazing deep fried, batter dipped nuggets of sweet corn...  Delicious!  I'd be back for those corn nuggets ALONE, but the fried chicken, the fried okra and the roll were also phenomenal too!  Fact: the soft roll didn't even make it home with me.  I'll add that my husband, who's a part time, half-assed vegetarian, scarfed down the extra piece of fried chicken that I saved for him too.

So seriously folks, take a look at the other reviews for this place; you have at least 5 Yelp Elite accounts giving this place high reviews, that should speak for something right there.

In a bucket resting on top my stomach (badum tish). \n\nAll joking aside, I have been a fan of Louisiana Fried Chicken (LFC) since discovering its now closed location in southern Phoenix years ago. So, like the buffalo herd moving onto greener pastures, the other LFC junkies and I must now venture to the Thomas Road location. \n\nThere are some advantages to this. While the new locale can be a bit of a drive for those scattered throughout the Phoenix area, it's an overall nicer venue. That being said, the interior doesn't standout that much from your average fast-food dining room. It's clean but uncomfortable seating is enough to get the job done. Much more than its now deceased Thomas Road brother. \n\nWhat makes LFC stand out is the food. Everything is expertly crafted in unison. The sweetness of the waffles and syrup complement the spice of the fired chicken and the salty-sweet fries accent the simple flavors of the green beans. Wash it all down with a soda pop and your addicted. \n\nThe chicken's breading contains a subtlety warm paprika based flavor that hits its fiery peak during the aftertaste. Suitable for almost all spice affinities. In many ways, this is my favorite aspect of LFC. I often find myself at odds with friends over where to eat due to my love of spicy food. The smoothness of the ingredients in LFC's culinary ventures make this less of an issue.\n\nThis isn't a restaurant dedicated to forging an image that matches the connotations associated with the food it serves. It doesn't try to pander to any particular crowd. It's a simple restaurant with a simple goal and because of such can be off-putting to some. \n\nMy largest complaint is placed largely with the customer service staff. While adequate a majority of time, they rarely aim to surpass expectations. This continued annoyance is what led to the 4-star rating as apposed to a five.\n\nOverall, it's a quality friend chicken shack in a town that has a tendency to lack this loved American pastime. \n\nCheck it out, write a review, and friend me on Yelp!!!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Tried this place for lunch with a co-worker.

Leaning over the bar that separates the mall from the restaurant, we decided that one day we'd return for beer and wings. But, mostly for the beer and to people watch...because that's what one does at CS Mall. After parting ways, I decided to give Wingstop a shot and was pleasantly surprised. \n\nThe restaurant was nearly empty when I walked in at 8 there was a young couple with their baby cart on a counter and a lady with a Wal-Mart shopping cart with her purchases (including a case of beer). Wingstop doesn't have a huge menu but they have the basics for survival: wings, fries, beer. With nine sauces from which to chose---Atomic, Cajun, Original Hot, Mild, Hickory Smoked BBQ, Lemon Pepper, Garlic Parmesan, Hawaiian and Teriyaki---there's a great variety of options. I sampled the Atomic and instantly knew that my mouth and stomach would hate me if I selected that sauce. Instead, I ordered a 10 piece boneless combo and Pacifico. I was given the option of two sauces---Original Hot and Garlic Parm, in this case---and a dip, blue cheese. After being informed it would take about nine minutes, I took a seat to take in the scene. \n\nFirst, I have to say the customer service was incredible. It's truly appreciated when young people exhibit even mediocre customer service skills and the crew here were solid. \n\nAs for the food, the wings were very good. The Original Hot are your basic wing sauce, nothing too fancy; the Garlic Parm was great with a generous sprinkling of parmesan cheese. The fries, as the website state, are fresh-cut and you can tell they're not processed in the normal fashion of fries, which is a good thing. You can even request more of your sauce or another from the list in which to dip your fries or wings. Sweet! The only complaint I have is the paper towels are only one roll located at the front counter. I guess I can understand keeping costs down by limiting the amount of waste that could happen, but wings can get messy.\n\nTuesday nights they have a $2 beer special: all beer is only $2!\n\nBy the time I left the front dining area had filled up a bit more, an encouraging sign.

Except it's not *that* cheap. \u00a310 for half a roast chicken?\n\nWhy do I come to Nandos? Because they do a lot of chicken and a lot of spice. And I like chicken and spice.

I had garlic parmesan and garlic hot. Ok, so I love garlic. Dont judge me! Especially if you are a vampire! The wings were a little bit bigger than your average size. Brian asked if I liked it extra crispy. Hell yes I do! So after I devoured my wings, things like hole in the wall and a 5 star review was already embedded in my head. From my last conversation with Brian, he is already coming up with even more sauces like mango slam and honey mustard slam. This guy works his butt off to keep you coming back and I for one am one of them!\n\nI also ordered garlic parmesan fries and fried pickles. YES, I SAID FRIED PICKLES! Both were off the hook and Brian also let me sample some sweet chili glazed fries. OMG it was some of the best fries I have had in a long time. Please refer to the amazing pics on here and your mouth will be watering. I guarantee it!\n\nAs I was finishing up, Brian just happen to serve me a peach cobbler fresh out of the oven as a token of appreciation. DAMN! If I knew he was gonna do that, I wouldnt of ate so many wings! I could only finish half of it. \n\nSpeaking of the peach cobbler, man this guy has some great desserts as well. I have tried the red velvet cake and the cookies. A special mention goes out to his rum cake as well. This is not a usual and its not on the menu but he made it for a customer one time so he decided to make two. One for the customer and one for whoever was lucky enough that day to be there when he put it out. Yes, I was there and boy oh boy it was awesome! If I ate any more I would need a cab to get home! Im sure he can specially make it for you if you let him know ahead of time so he can do his magic. That is the advantage of baking your own desserts! You can taste the freshness for sure! Oh, before I forget, Brian tells me he is in the process of bringing in Bluebelle Ice Cream. For those that dont know, that's only something that you only see on the east coast.

Time after time they've shown remarkable patience and a willingness to grab the sauce bottles and give you a taste as well as explain to you the origins of the sauce and it's various other similar flavors or new flavors that have emerged from that once sauce.\n\nTweek the Flavor\nLets say you choose a flavor but it's a bit spicier then you expected. This happens to me on a few occasions. I dont handle spicy all too well so i asked to cut the spicy by a third. They did it and it came out perfect. It's too spicy for you or not spicy enough? Ask them to crank it up or tweek it down. All sauces are made in house so they'd be more then willing to accommode you. \n\nThe Fries\nTo be honest i love the regular fries. It's a mixture of the Seasoned dry rub flavor and a bit of the Cajun dry rub flavor but to me it's perfect for fries. Their fries dont come out of a plastic bag that's been frozen for a while. You are eating real washed skin on potatos and you can tell they are too, no two fries are the same and they all taste good. A new option is available to season your fries in different flavors as well. Garlic Parm is a huge hit among the masses as well as Sweet Chili. Be warned as these are better dine in then to go as the fries get soggy if you dont eat them fast enough.\n\nThere's Always Room for Dessert\nDesserts are also all home made and made in house. The usual lineup of desserts include a Red Velvet cake, their Too Much Chocolate cake, chocolate cookies, and everyone's favorite: the Peach Cobbler. If you're lucky there will be something different. I struck gold on two occasions when there was a soaked Rum cake available one day and a few weeks later a German Chocolate cake with the coconut cream center.\n\nBottom line. If you're hungry and in the mood for a whole lot of flavors that wont leave you broke till next week. Wing King is the place to check out. If you're on a diet and dont think you should be eating wings or desserts, come anyway. Pretty sure Brian can season a basket of celery sticks for ya.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 4, "useful": 17, "cool": 10}}, {"text": "Is it okay if I write a review for just the peach cobbler?\nBecause that's what this review is about.\n\nTHIS IS THE BEST PEACH COBBLER IN TOWN, HANDS DOWN.

If your breath not smell like garlic then you know not garlic fries. Right!?! Still there more depth then just the garlic add the parmesan and right seasonings! Beautiful thing!  Seasonings, flavors, depth, and balance is something say about ALL 40 flavors of wings choose from too four of five different style fries too choose off the menu.

I appreciate lot shows much he cares about every single sauce he puts his heart and soul in. \n\nThe wings I was going too iceacholics christmas party so got 50 wings too go. It not party platters they start at 100 wings but get fries and another things with party platter. They even go higher then 100 wings but 50 wings was just the right amount. I was having trouble deciding flavors too choose from since you can go 1-5 different flavors went order party amount of wings. Brain was super helpful. We talked about balance of mild too hot style sauces. End came up with four new one asian orange, sweet barbeque, jamacian jerk, and habanero honey. The Habanero honey and jamacian jerk stood out! Both nice kick too them but so much more depth then just heat. I always have problem with any wings/tenders ask for Hot. In essence all tobasco pr durkee red hot or any vinegar base horrible. All the sauces even the mild ones at wing kings the depth of flavors AWESOME! Not just heat with both Habanero Honey or Jamacian Jerk. The Habanero taste the sweetness of the honey counters the balance of the heat from the habanero then add other seasonings brings it full circle. Same things say for the jamacian jerk. I hardly even made dent in 40 flavors but without doubt will make it back enough times too get all 40 flavors in! The chicken can get traditional or boneless. Wings only way too go traditional way not licking fingers clean or getting little messy. The wings are nice crispy on the outside, cooked moist inside, and nice hot. They do amazing job comes too packing them too go. He separates all four different flavors in tin foil, all arrange mild too hot in same pan, and perfect size tight lid keep warm till party starts. He labels the top just in case not forget. It comes with nice amount of celery sticks and nice side of ranch. \n\nThe desserts! Talk about really secret gem in Vegas! It last place you think bake their own fresh DAILY desserts. It presented old school fashion in cake stands with covers too pie pan with cover for his peach cobbler.

If I were to rank this place on the wings alone, it would be 5 stars. \n\nHowever, we did try some mediocre side dishes that really let me down.  First, the fries were overcooked and over seasoned.  The second offender was the macaroni & cheese, which was basically Kraft mac n cheese with some garlic salt and a ton of black pepper added to it.  The potato salad was a disaster, and really lacked any real flavor. Add in a stale Hawaiian roll, and our lunch was complete. \n\nLet's talk about the service for a minute (or lack thereof).  I placed my order at 12:09 pm, and did not receive my lunch until 12:50 pm.  What's funny is that the place wasn't busy. There were 2 ladies in front of us-thats it! The entire food court was empty, so it was easy to count them.  In fact there were more gnats in the building than there were customers.  Since the doors were open, these creatures decided to have lunch with us.  The gentleman with the pony tail behind the counter was not friendly in the slightest.  All he could do was begrudgingly take my order and complain that he was short staffed for the day.

I place my order over the phone and walk in 20 minutes later to the background music of Gansta's Paradise.

Any place not playing Gangsta's Paradise automatically loses a star. Ok, sorry for getting sidetracked. \n\nUpon entering, the place was a little smokey, but not because of the Bob Marley posters all around if you know what I'm saying. It had the smokiness of poorly ventilated fryers. It wasn't overwhelming. I've worked kitchens before, this was pretty mild and you get used to it immediately. The gentleman that helped me, Brian, was a nice polite guy. I told him I've been hearing good things about the place and wanted to check it out. There was a check in offer for a small dessert, so that was awesome. I opted for the chocolate bundt cake, because he said it was the freshest. He also went out of the way to pop everything open and verify the order was correct. And then he wrote on the cake container to microwave for 20-30 seconds. He said it makes it nice and gooey like a brownie. I cant begin to say how much the tiny attention to detail was appreciated. I love when a food service establishment goes out of their way with customer service, mainly because a lot of places tend to get that part dead wrong. \n\nI tried a bunch of different stuff. The french fries stole the show. I'll get that out of the way up front. They had an awesome seasoning on them. I got boneless and traditional wings in the flavors of Parmesan Garlic, Spicy Parmesan Garlic, Mango BBQ, and Mild. I'm a huge fan of Parmesan Garlic at most places. This place wasn't particularly the best though. It was just ok. I enjoyed it, but I've had better. The spicy version tasted off. It was my least favorite of the four. Mango BBQ was solid. Sweet with just a small kick of hot. And Mild was... well Mild. It was a safe bet and it didn't disappoint. The Mac and Cheese was a let down. Not expensive, but not on some BFG level or anything. I'd skip that altogether next time in favor of a bigger size of fries. Did I mention the fries were bomb? Because they were. Mmm, I can taste those seasonings now. Also, the cake was pretty good. Nice and fresh and satisfying. \n\nIf you are in the area and craving wings, definitely try this place out. I'm going to go back to experience some more flavors and of course, the fries.

I've been to a few other places in this food court and remembered this place- site indicates that they have 40 flavors of sauce, so I thought they'd be a good option.\n\nIn short, guys, I was blown away. Menu offers 6 wings for $5, so naturally I went hog wild and got three orders- for research purposes, you understand. Gotta make sure this review is thorough.\n\nThe spicy garlic parm were amazing. I love garlic, I love parm, and I love spice- but usually garlic parm wings are dry, bland, and/or underwhelming, but never spicy. Here, they actually ARE! And the excess cheese crumbles in the dish are delicious too. This was the favorite flavor by far.\n\nNext up was spicy mesquite barbeque- I'm a Texas girl, and Mesquite BBQ is a Texas thing. This flavor took me back home, in a good way. Warm heat, got the spices right. \n\nJamaican Jerk Barbeque was recommended to me by the cashier as her favorite- and they were excellent. Extra saucy, warm heat and a lot of flavor. Not as good as the garlic parm, but still good- and an option you won't find too many places.\n\nI'll def be going back to try more flavors, and perhaps buy stock in the spicy garlic parm. Menu also boasts \"pig wings\" which are actually mini hams? Doesn't sound appealing to me at all, but they're the only place in the state that offers them so that means I'll get around to trying them sooner or later.\n\nSide note on the service; as a note says by the front counter, this is not a fast food place. Your order is made WHEN you order, so expect a wait. Mine took a reasonable 15 minutes, and I was pleased with the product.

The mango slam had a nice jerk flavor with some sweet fruitiness. The parm came with a lot of grated parmesan, but the flavor for me was just OK. I ended up dipping them in the mango slam since that was more my type of flavor and the BF picked the garlic parm. The wings were a good sized and crispy though. \n\nFried pickles were nice thin pickles so they fried up like chips. These I really liked. It came with some ranch type dip, but this probably would be awesome with some mustard based sauce. We got a regular, but the basket was rather generous of a portion. \n\nThe fries came seasoned and are skin on. These reminds me of fries at places like 5 Guys and are rather solid if you like those thick cut natural skin on type fries.\n\nThe check in offer is with purchase is a free a dessert. We got a slice of rum cake. It was good, but maybe a bit too boozy since it was straight soaked in rum, If you want a buzzed dessert though this is for you. \n\nSo the ambiance looks not like much but the wings and the fried pickles hit the spot so I would be back during lunch when I just want a quick bite.

But about 5 minutes later they brought out 3 pieces because they felt bad about their mistake. I was impressed. \n\nAs for the wings, not bad. Not bad at all. I think I will go for more bolder sauces next time like Mango Habanero. The fries were sprinkled with some type of cajun spices which made it pretty good. Not as good as sweet chili glazed fries but good nonetheless. Lastly, you get a 12 ounce can of soda. Not a bad deal for 10 bucks.\n\nAs a bonus, when you check in you get a free dessert!

This is an ode to a popular burger served at two rival bars in Minneapolis.  The versions in the twin cities are two patties shaped around cheese, so that the cheese is in the middle of the burger and hot.  Think of it as a cheeseburger lava cake.  CB&CB's Juicy Lucy is two patties with cheese in between.  The beef was overcooked, and the cheese was barely there.  The sweet tots I had as a side were awesome.\n\nMy girlfriend went with the CB&CB Burger with chips.  I took a bite and thought this was a wonderful signature burger.  The gruyere cheese and caramelized onions went together perfectly.  The chips were very good.\n\nThe beer selection is awesome.  The draft menu alone is about 15 or 16 beers.  There's about 50 bottles and another 20 cans to chooses from.  There are easy views of the TVs over the bar and on one of the walls with a few games playing.  CB&CB also has a later happy hour (goes until 7pm), with good prices.  They also advertise a lot of specials (e.g. 10% carryout Tuesday).  There's also a good looking selection of sandwiches and a builder your own burger and build your mac and cheese menu.\n\nThe cons.\nAs already mentioned one of the burgers was very disappointing.  That's a shame considering this is burger bar.  There's no real waiting area, so people are just kind of awkwardly standing around while waiting for a table.  I sometimes felt like they were watching me eat.  We were also seated at a table right next to the soda fountain and server station.

Let me expound on that. Honestly it was just one HUGE negative that brought this review from 4 stars to a measly one star. But I'll get to that in a minute. Let me tell you why I was going to give a 4 star review: The biggest reason, very nice staff. My server & the manager just kinda hung out & talked with me. Secondly, very nice atmosphere(They literally just remodeled). Thirdly(keep in mind I've only been there once & only got the 3-patty burger challenge) the burger was good, not great, but I have been told by many that their TOT CHO's (tater-tot nacho's) & their custom Mac N' Cheese are unique & to-die-for. Unfortunately, I'll will never get to try them, b/c despite all the positives I've mentioned, the ONE HUGE NEGATIVE I experienced, has caused me, out of principle, to never come here ever again. That issue: RIDICULOUS, UNDISCLOSED PRICE GOUGING. Let me explain. They have burger challenges ranging from 3-14, half LB. patties. You have to beat the champions time for each respective size & if u do, u get a picture on the wall & the burger is free. Now, their cheapest burgers are $10 & come with fries. Additional patties are $5. So,the cheapest 3 patty burger should cost $20 & come with fries. But for the challenge, you don't have to eat the fries, so in my opinion, they should knock $2 bucks off, but they don't. Mildly irritating, but no big deal. $20 for a 1 &1/2 pound gourmet cheese burger in North Scottsdale is not insane. However,\n 30 FREAKIN' DOLLARS, the amount of my bill is HIGHWAY ROBBERY. So how the Hell did it cost $30, when I could've ordered a BETTER BURGER(more & better toppings) WITH FRIES off of the menu for $20?. The old Switch-a-roo, that's how. First of all, they don't let you order a $10 single patty burger & add two $5 patties to it. Oh no, that would be WWWWAAAAAAYYY too logical & fair. No, you have to buy the $18 2 Patty Mammoth burger, which isn't even on the menu & all it comes w/ is cheese lettuce & tomato. Then you have to add a $5 patty to that, making it $23 before tax FOR JUST THE BURGER.I know what you're saying \"But Chris, if all u got was just the burger, no drink or anything,(which was the case) after tax it would still be like $25 & change. Well now comes in the part that explains why I will never come here again. I told the manager I didn't want the lettuce & pickles. He said, no problem, you can SUBSTITUTE 2 pieces of bacon for each veggie i want to take off. Now, call me crazy, but if a Server says you can SUBSTITUTE something & don't mention an upcharge, to me that means the substitution is free. Apparently, this place didn't get the memo. Not only did they rob me of the fries AND CHARGE charge me an unexplained extra $3 dollars, they charged me another 4 FREAKIN DOLLARS FOR 4 BACON STRIPS!!!!!!!!!!!!! And in case u were wondering I did finish it, but not in time. So I had to pay $29.15 for a slightly above-average, 1& 1/2LB. cheese burger w/ 4 strips of bacon on it!!!!!!!!!! I've litterally have had $8 burgers @ Chilie's that were just as good & satisfying, b/c they came with fries. So basically, in my opinion, I was double charged, b/c they most I would have willingly paid for that burger is $15 MAX, AFTER TAX. I paid $29.15!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So when I actually cut the burger in half, that area including the bread was drenched in BBQ sauce.

Really? ...To be honest, I never actually thought about it. Prior to the arrival of this small-time chain to downtown Madison, all we had by way of decent wings was Buffalo Wild Wings. And I wouldn't even think of setting foot in that place ever again, because \"decent\" is a huge overstatement.\n\nYou're getting a lot more than that at Quaker Steak & Lube. The boneless chicken wings, for example, set a standard for chicken wings that I've never tasted before. The outside is fried to a perfect crispy texture that manages to avoid falling into that trap of being chewy and fatty, while still transcending your traditional fried chicken coating. \n\nThere's a variety of interesting sauces to try at this place, and since you can mix any number of them at no additional charge, there's no way you could run out of things to try. I decided to venture 6 wings with a combination of their spicy Arizona Ranch sauce and their less-spicy Pineapple Rum sauce. The combination resulted in something that smelled and tasted 10 times better than I could have ever possibly expected. \n\nHowever, the spiciness was pitifully weak. With Arizona Ranch being ranked as having the highest Scoville rating of their medium-range sauces, I can't help but wonder just how spicy they can make a wing. In their defense, I didn't care to try the Atomic Sauce lest it taste like melted pennies (I'm looking at you, Blazin' Sauce), but I still want a burn if I'm getting the next-highest thing.\n\nI got some onion rings on the side as well, and while I wasn't expecting much, these are the best onion rings I have had in a long long time. Normally I receive floppy onion rings that automatically sort and separate themselves into chewy onion and broken, brittle breading the second I take a bite. But these onion rings managed to retain their texture and taste damn good in the process. Onion and all, it gives a nice crunch. Quaker Steak & Lube's onion rings are essentially the onion version of good steak-cut french fries.\n\nI do take issue with the prices here. All that and a cheap domestic beer cost me around 15 bucks after tax and tip. For a small batch of boneless wings, you're paying over a dollar a wing. And you can't just buy wings in bulk, since they won't let you pick more than one sauce/mix for a larger amount. In this respect, Quaker Steak & Lube is performing just as poorly as B-Dub's.

There's car stuff plastered all over the place, including a working stop and go light. Though, when the place is called \"Quaker Steak & Lube,\" is that really all that surprising? No. Although NASCAR isn't typically associated with class--this join was very clean and the staff members were extremely willing to help out.\n\nI had a grilled boneless chicken in Chipotle BBQ sauce with bleu cheese. My roommate had honey mustard wings with a Green Light Rita (margarita).\n\nMy grilled boneless chicken was interesting: I prefer boneless because you get to eat the entire thing as opposed to picking it off a bone and potentially wasting meat. It wasn't really what you typically expect of boneless wings: it was more like a boneless breast with the sauce on it. It wasn't bad, but I'm not sure it was worth the ~$8 I paid for it when I could've made it at home. It tasted good, though there's only four boneless wings in that set if you get the regular size. The Chipotle BBQ sauce has a really nice little kick on your tastebuds, but not overwhelming. It's great if you prefer more milder tastes but with only a little bit of spice.\n\nMy roommate allowed me to try her honey mustard wings: they're sweet with a very nice glaze. As opposed to Buffalo Wild Wings (which isn't bad)--they cover the entire wing in the sauce as opposed to a dallop here and there in the center of the wing. The meat was succulent and juicy which pleasantly surprises me for a large-scale chain restaurant--but that explains why it got as big as it did!\n\nHer Green Light Rita was very good too; it was very sweet, though I suspect that was because of the melon liqueur within it. I would recommend getting it frozen, however.\n\nOverall, I'll most definitely be back--the service was great! They even give you a warm wipe and a Twizzlers when you leave. I much prefer this place to Buffalo Wild Wings as the sauces are heavier and the meat is more juicy.

I was good at all of the sports the other boys wished they were. I was great at shooting dice, 3 Card Monty, pick pocketing and loan sharking. I was the envy of my entire 3rd grade class. Very few kids that age can play the shell game on a street corner for 8 hours and then kneecap some deadbeat over a 20 dollar debt at night.  I was a machine...a well oiled, tight bodied machine. The girls...oh the girls...nap time was a special time. A young Rex surrounded by his prepubescent harem.  It was magical. I was on top of the world.  My aunt Eunice would see me come back with some old man's pension check, because he owed 3 weeks of the vig after betting on the Giants, she would beam with pride.  We would go to our special place...and then he would take me for food. I deserved it...believe me. She would buy me fried chicken. I loved it. It washed out the taste of low tide. Bribe sweet bribe. Bribed my silence.  As an older man I look back on those days and still cringe. Sure the money was good. Sure the chicken was good. The rest...not so much.\n\nI tell this tale of woe and want for one reason...all of that great chicken was almost blotted out of existence from a combination of court ordered therapy, LSD, electroshock, and Kenny G Therapy...my own creation...not for the week of heart.  I discuss it in detail in \"Kenny G: How the Devil Gave Us Therapy.\"  Those great chicken dinners would be lost to the recesses of my mind...just flickering images...like the ones I see of me standing on top of a building, naked, wearing a beer hat and smoking a cigar...images of meaningful nonsense. That was until I went to the Chicken Shack. Oh, sweet Chicken Shack. Let me hold you. Let me kiss you. Let me call you aunt...wait...never mind. \nChicken Shack does what it does...and it does it amazingly! Chicken Shack chicken is never frozen. The breasts and the wings are huge...like Busty Dusty big. Ah, memories...I almost suffocated at a club in Pittsburgh once. \n\nThe 5 strip lunch/dinner is more than enough for the biggest eater.  It comes with fries and a drink for under 8 bucks.  Fountain drink for unlimited soda. I saw these two huge fat guys mowing down a 5 piece. They looked full. They looked content. They looked like they had hypertension. God Bless America. The wings are excellent but I recommend the strips. More meat. Tender. Juicy. Delicious. Same price. \n\nThe sauces. The sauces are key to a place like this. Like having weed on you when trying to sleep with Jennifer Aniston. Mandatory.  Well, Chicken Shack doesn't disappoint. Recently I had the special Habenero Honey. It was sweet. It was hot. It hurt a little bit after 4 pieces. It hurt the good way...like being dumped by Amanda Peet...that body can only keep you happy for a long time...then you are just praying for a stroke.  The BBQ sauce is excellent. The Garlic Parmesan sauce is absolutely amazing. The chili lime isn't very good, sorry. Too limey...like Hugh Grant. \n\nIf chicken isn't your thing...then you think that Rex will tear into you for going to THE CHICKEN SHACK...but no...not at all...they have a burger there that is amazing. A single. A double. A triple. You can add cheese and bacon. Yes...triple cheese and bacon.  Oh is it good...it's really good. I ate it. I cried. I ate it again. I cried harder. I threw a chair out the window. I ran. \n\nThey have an all you can eat chicken wing and 1 dollar beers. If that doesn't sound good to you then you are a loser. I say that with no hesitation. No remorse. No second guessing. You are the type of person who would hold up a bank but leave the stuff in the safe.\n\nThe atmosphere is great. They have funny slogans on the wall. Cute. Sickeningly cute. Rex is sarcastic. Rex hates it. Others will love it. \nThe bottom line is that this is obviously a family place run by people who actually care.

We got a lot of different flavors and sauces on the chicken.  Mild and medium heat chicken wings/tenders, lemon pepper wings and my favorite, garlic Parmesan wings.  The wings are super crispy and juicy inside.  I ate a bunch of wings and they were all cooked perfectly.  The garlic Parmesan really had a lot of flavor and no overly salty.  ON POINT!!!

This is a very small place that can seat perhaps 30 people approximately.\n\nb.  The fare - Here you can get hamburger, chicken strips, chili and the famous chicken wings.  You can buy by quantity or in combos.  We decided the 25 piece for 22.89 and also the fries. \n\nc.  The taste - Nice and plump wings with a crispy textured coating. Very nice. Not greasy or anything, just right. The sauces come in a variety of flavors that are given to you free based on the quantity you order. \n\nd.  The extras - If you want something like ranch or blue cheese, this will cost you like .39c per small cup.  Odd, but okay.  The veggies of carrots and celery cost you and is considered a side.  They have small and large side portions including macaroni salad and potato salad.  I am sure there were other things I am missing here as I was focused on the wings.\n\ne.

I'm a fatty, but I was full off of 6 wings because they're bigger and meatier. \n\nFor sides, we've tried the cole slaw, baked beans, and fries - only the fries were really good crispy shoestrings, I'd pass on the rest and just stick with wings. For sauce my fav is the habanero honey (not that spicy) and garlic parm. The bbq and sweet chili were pretty standard, but I also liked the wings just plain because they had seasoning already. \n\nService was great and the tables were clean the 2 times that I've been, with guys coming out to wipe down tables as soon as they're free. I hate nickel and diming - they charge for ranch/blue cheese and extra sauce, but what can you do.\n\nI also agree with others who've said that their chicken fingers are dry - stick with the wings.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 2, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "Avoid this place.\n\nI've definitely had better.

I like a fry with a good bit of crisp, but without too much crunch where it is overcooked. These fries must have been sitting around for a long time. The chicken was terrible.

The Atomic don't disappoint, yet I would say that the Long Wong's suicide are way hotter, but that's not a complaint really, since most people are sane and don't enjoy scorching their mouth in hopes to FEEL SOMETHING.  This is why I'm on Prozac. \n\nI usually don't order the wings here, not because they're not good, but because sometimes I feel weird eating saucy meat off a bone in front of my co-workers.  Like, I have to be fucking you to really show you that side of my disgusting self.  So I've tried a few different things.  I've gotten the mozzarella sticks a few times and they're pretty awesome as far as fried cheese goes.  The fries are also always awesome, made fresh and hot and perfect and not all fancied up or done down, just fried potatoes made to order like it should be. \n\nThe worst thing I got here were the chicken nuggets.  They were obviously frozen, kinda spongey, kinda gross.  Yet, the next time we came here the nuggets were OFF THE MENU, and in their place were NEW CHICKEN STRIPS.  Which, naturally, I ordered and were totally better, crispy, juicy, a little spicy.  See, family places like this, they consult, they think, they know when shit sucks, and they fix it.\n\nThey have a lunch special which my co-worker orders EVERY time; six wings and fries and a drink for about seven bucks. \n\nBuffalo Brown's can be a little off putting at first.  It's pretty much always empty and the few employees (the family) don't exactly seem totally stoked about your presence, but they always deliver on quality and service.  Also, there's a jukebox and a pool table in the back and while on most days neither of these items are in use, in fact they seem dusty, recently we were winging and beering here when a couple of people started blaring some hip hop music in the tiny, Asian family owned wing joint and it seemed bizarre, but oddly cinematic. \n\nI think I even saw the straight laced Asian cook bobbing his head a little.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Very good wings - right up there with Long Wongs, maybe even a little better.

Anways, on my last visit I order medium wings, which is rare for me because I tend to prefer somthing hotter but I was sharing with a friend who doesn't like spicy food. When our wings arrived we both bit into them we just looked at eachother with panic beucase our mouths were burning. I chugged half a beer because they were that hot, which for me would be fine but my friend looked like she was going to fall off her chair. When the waitress came back we explained how hot they were and my friend told her she would not be able to eat them the waitress said \"Well yeah, the medium wings here are pretty hot\" and looked at us with confusion as if we were supposed to just know this or something. We asked if there was anything she could do and she offered to bring us out some ranch dip or mild sauce which to me is a joke. I used to work in a Sports Bar and I know for a fact I would have immediately offered new wings or at least a credit to the bill. Instead she offered nothing, so my friend ate nothing and we paid and left. I will go back because I have had better experiences there in the past but all in all the customer service was not good.

They've filled our living rooms during football season, Sunday afternoons at the in-law's house, your cousin's girlfriend's baby brother's daughter's birthday party. And most of all, they're tied for number #1 reason to lick your fingers next to BBQ ribs! I've been all over the U.S. and I have yet to find wings and service as great as Wingstop on Craig Road! I don't eat in the restaurant as often as I used because I like to watch a movie with my girlfriend so I'll make a call to place the order.  When I do eat in, they have old school R&B music playing through the speakers at night and I love Motown! I've gone here a few times by myself and spent a little QT just vibing with the ambiance.\n\nBest service! They always say \"14 minutes\" and they've never gotten anything wrong with my order. Sometimes though, sometimes they tend to get my name wrong but I understand my name doesn't make that task very easy.  I'll get Ahmed, Arman, and I even got Ivan. I usually give my nickname because it's easier.... failed plan! Some patrons may find that a bit annoying but personally, I find it amusing. I've turned the incorrect names I've gotten into a game. I'm planning to make a scrapbook and story of all the times and moments.  It comes with having a unique name right? :) Make sure they get your name right if you don't find that amusing though.\n\nThe different flavors are what makes this place a neighborhood favorite. My personal favorites are the Lemon Pepper and Garlic Parmesan. I prefer the \"flats\" as oppose to the drummettes. I also order my fries extra crispy! I make sure I have bleu cheese and my order is set to go! I also like their Hot flavor.  It has a sour zing to them (probably from vinegar in the sauce) which I enjoy a bunch!

I have no reason why, we just all of a sudden over the last two months have been craving chicken wings.  There are a number of restaurants here in Las Vegas to satisfy that craving.  Seems like nearly every chain includes them on the menu in some appetizer form.  But what if there was a restaurant out there that ONLY served wings?  Ingenious!  There's a few out there, but our first try was Wingstop.\n\nWe actually have two locations within our neck of the woods, but one Wingstop location is located in the Santa Fe Hotel & Casino.  Went to this one over on Craig after hearing they had the ubiquitous choose-your-own-flavor-combination Coca-Cola Freestyle machine!  Selling Coke products in itself is reward for me!  I could sit there for hours thinking what to drink next.  I need one of these things in my house.  Along with some insulin.\n\nEntering the restaurant is nice enough, lots of green, white, gray, and I like the dark wood.  Definitely gives off a sports bar vibe.  And sure enough, multiple flat screen TV's spread throughout the dining area all showing some sort of sport.  Sweet!  Eat some wings, watch some football!  Darnit, why Wingstop don't you serve up some beers!  Would be perfect!\n\nWingstop offers three main kinds of chicken:  classic wings, boneless wings, and boneless strips.  Boneless wings and boneless strips look almost the same, except that boneless wings are shaped more like wings (duh).  All get the same treatment though, a ride through the flavor train of one of Wingstop's 10 different sauces!  Toot toot!  You have as your choices (from mild to hot):\n\n-Teriyaki\n-Hawaiian\n-Garlic Parmesan\n-Lemon Pepper\n-Hickory Smoked BBQ\n-Mild\n-Louisiana Rub\n-Original Hot\n-Cajun\n-Atomic\n\nWe haven't tried them all yet, but so far our faves are the Louisiana Rub, Lemon Pepper, and the Original Hot.  Finger lickin' good!  I know there are some reviews with complaints about their wings not done properly, and of course this can happen.  Lucky for us, our wings were cooked just right - moist and juicy on the inside, slightly crunchy skin of the outside!  No pink in the middle for us.  We tried the classic wings and the boneless strips.  I must say, even though the strips are a bit meatier, I prefer the joy of eating a classic wing.  They originated in Buffalo for Christ's sake....they are called BUFFALO WINGS!  Yeah I just stick with the classic.  But I'm sure kids out there might rather have boneless wings or strips.\n\nNot only do you get your chicken dragged through sauce, but you can also opt for a dip.  Your choice of either a container of Ranch or Bleu Cheese, Honey Mustard, or Hot Aged Cheddar Cheese.  Original Hot wings with a dip of Bleu Cheese?  I'm set.\n\nWingstop offers a variety of combo meals to fit your needs.  You have individual combo meals, meals for two, and even family packs.  If it's just the wifey and I we go with the 15 piece wing combo meal for two.  If it's us with the kiddies we opt for one of the smaller family packs.  Good thing about these is that we can choose wings, boneless wings, or strips, or a combination of all three.  Everyone can be happy.\n\nWingstop also has a number of sides to choose from:\n\n-Seasoned Fries\n-Veggie Sticks (carrot and celery)\n-Bourbon Baked Beans\n-Cheese Fries\n-Yeast Rolls \n-Coleslaw\n-Potato Salad\n\nI like the seasoned fries and the veggie sticks.  Here's a tip though - ask for them to cook the fries longer!  Sometimes they pull them out a bit early and you end up with soggy fries.  Disaster!  I tend to like mine more on the overdone side.\n\nPrices are ok, about what you think it would cost for chicken and fries.  In the range of about $8-$9 for an individual combo meal.  You get a bit better deal on the combo meals though instead of a la carte.  Reason I had to knock down Wingstop a star is because the service is hit-or-miss.  One person helping you may be great, but the person next to them might be downright dreary.  Hey chica, if you don't want to work there...leave!  Massive unemployment and mouths to feed means someone will gladly take your spot right away.  Just sayin'.\n\nWingstop.

It takes about 10 minutes to cook once you place your order, so don't go if you're in a rush.

Wing Heaven was just a letdown.  \n\nThe concept is great, wings, fish, other fried delights.  But where Wing Heaven fails is in the execution of it all.  Just not what you would expect for a newer establishment.  I just couldn't give this place more stars if I tried.  If it was better when they first opened, then Wing Heaven should get back on the straight and narrow soon to keep patrons coming in at a good clip.  \n\nWing Heaven was a drive for us, a bit out of the way.  Entering the place, it is nice enough.  No tables if you plan on eating here, just a few stools and a flat screen TV or two for you to catch up on sports while you wait for your order.  And boy, did we WAIT.  It was a weekend night and it wasn't busy at all in the store.  There was one other couple ordering at the time.  1) We weren't greeted by the owner, or anyone in the place for that matter.  2) After the couple in front of us ordered, the owner and them proceeded to shoot the SH!+ with each other for at least 10 minutes (yes I timed them).  And not once did ANYONE greet us or tell us that they would be right with us.  A bit annoying.  3) When we finally did get to the register to place our order, the owner wasn't exactly friendly or welcoming with the wifey and I in his place.  Could be just that's his demeanor, but still, you want my continued business, please at least FAKE a smile to show some effort.  I got the whiff that his food was gonna speak for itself, so I figure I would just give it a chance.\n\nWe thought about the catfish (but I favor Mario's Westside for that), but ended up going with a pound of fried pollock because it was on special.  The seasoning we chose was Garlic Vinegar.  You know us Filipinos, lovin' our garlic and vinegar like it was salt and pepper.  The real reason we drove down to Wing Heaven was because my wife loves fried gizzards, and this was one of the only places I've heard of that serve them on a regular basis.  So we got a pound of those as well.  Paid, and proceeded to wait while our order was being prepared.  That was a long 10 minutes.  \n\nOwner finally warmed up a bit and asked us if we liked cheesecake.  He said he was going to make us a treat to try out.  Yay, some life out of this guy.  A few minutes later we are given a cheesecake bite of sorts with chocolate and raspberry sauce on top.  It was OK.  But I was expecting something a bit more homemade.  These seemed like those cheesecake bites you get from your local warehouse store, just covered up in batter and fried.  Good effort, but wish it was more original.  Glad we were offered it though, it's the only reason I went and gave Wing Heaven another star.\n\nUpon our take out order arriving I lifted the bag.  It really seemed LIGHT.  I had to ask behind the counter, \"Bro, you sure this fish is a pound?\"  Guy says yes.  I did the WRONG thing by just leaving with a \"Thanks\" and not checking on my order.\n\nThe wifey and I finally drive back to our side of town and get to sit down to enjoy our meal, and immediately are disappointed.  Our pound of fried fish seemed so measly!  It looks like they included the weight of all the seasonings BEFORE frying!  So sad.  Our fish pieces were so small, and much of our fish order was in tiny bite size pieces.  Just bad!  Lots of batter bits, and not much fish.  The only thing good about this was the Garlic Vinegar seasoning, it gave good tang to what was lackluster fish.  I wish I had remembered to take pics of this, but it was so upsetting I totally disregarded it.  But the wifey can vouch for this fish being just a disappointment.  It came with a tiny condiment container of cole slaw, but that wasn't so tasty either.  Needed more vinegar, and less mayo.  Tartar sauce?  Nothing special.\n\nOn to the fried gizzards, which were a letdown as well.  Granted, our trip to our eating area wasn't very far, I wasn't expecting our fried items to hold up the greatest because just about everything at Wing Heaven is packed to go (since they have no real eating area in house).  But the gizzards were rubbery!  Like shoe leather rubbery!  It can mean two things - either the gizzards were overcooked OR the gizzards are a frozen-type product and not fresh made.  No amount of Louisiana hot sauce could really save these gizzards from being yummy.  No bueno.\n\nAbout $15 total for our order since we opted to not go the meal route, since it was our first time to Wing Heaven we wanted to feel out the food.  I really hate to say it, but looks like we won't be back anytime soon.  Maybe it was an off day for them, or maybe there are some kinks (one of the cooks seemed to be in training), but I just didn't connect with this place.

Not a huge deal since they were super busy. \n\nOur server (who will go unnamed) greeted herself and took our drink orders. I ordered a long-island iced tea since they were on special and I haven't had one in forever. It was HORRIBLE, I have had many Long-Islands in my day and this by far was the worst. It was orange, I think they filled the glass half way with sour mix, added some well liquor even though it was supposed to be top-shelf and forgot the splash of coke. Problem is she brought the drink when she took our food order so I didn't get a chance to drink it until she walked away.

I had ordered a create-your-own chicken sandwich with a side salad instead of fries. The sandwich came out exactly as I had ordered. However, I had the wrong dressing for my salad and we had no silverware. She dropped off the food, never asked if we wanted anything else and just took off, I tried stopping her but that was a lost cause. \n\nI sat there looking around, trying to make eye-contact with anyone who was glancing my way. Our server was just standing by the bar chit-chatting. Finally someone walked by and I asked if we could get silverware and ketchup, I had high-hopes she would bring me a fork, but she didn't. So there I sit some more, unable to eat my salad. Finally a manager walked by and I asked him, instead of him grabbing it, he shouted for someone else to do it. YAY, I got a fork. Too bad the dressing was wrong (and not tasty) and no server to ask to correct it. Finally when I'm putting my last bite in my mouth she came over and asked how we're doing. Really?

I came in to this restaurant with really high hopes. My buddy and I went on Monday night, and while the deal is 20% off steaks on Monday nights, I went with the chicken fried chicken. My appetizer was really good, I had the golden ravioli. My buddy doesn't like ravioli in the least, but I had him try it fried, and he loved it. The multiple televisions had the Saints at the 49ers. A good mix of fans, who showed up mostly a little after kick off. For dinner, as I said previously I had the chicken fried chicken. It was dry, the mashed potatoes it came with were cold, but the gravy was good. My buddy had the buffalo chicken sandwich, and he liked the sauce on the chicken, but the roll was hard. The waffle fries were very good though. As the game progressed, by eyes got the better of me and I had to sample a dessert. I went with the cookies and cream. Hot chocolate chip cookie, Vanilla ice cream, Whipped cream. While I kicked myself after the fact for ordering a dessert, it was very good. One thing I didn't really understand was the lack of beer specials throughout the entire game. I guess Budweiser was 3 dollars for a pint until 7, but it is a football night... at a sports bar... Maybe I'm crazy, but I would expect at least a little more. \n\nThe food while not great, had some high points. My low point of the night was when the bill came. We politely asked the waitress to split the bill, and she obliged. When she brought the separate checks and I went through my itemized bill. The problem is that she brought 2 copies of my buddy's bill. Easily forgiven as human error, I'm happy to forgive. When I got her attention to explain the situation she proceeded to tell me that no, I was wrong and she gave me the right bill. That the 2 descriptions were not the same, and even if they were the change was the only thing that was different between the 2 and so just pay. Now... I've never punished a waitress for the food, or the ambiance, or anything of that sort. I pay her for her SERVICE. I am a 25-35% tipper. I work in customer service and understand how it can be difficult sometimes. This time she got 6% tip. I'm not a customer is always right kinda person, but admitting mistakes is a huge part of customer service. That was TERRIBLE customer service. \n\nAll of this was not a enough to dissuade me from coming again, although next time I will probably sit at the bar, as bartenders normally have a better understanding of customer service. \n\nI want to like Wolfley's, I really do.

I would have ordered their hometown favorite roast beef sandwich, but the waitress warned me it was quite salty.  I'm glad she did since I don't take kindly on overly salty foods. So I ordered the cheeseburger sliders instead. Let's just say I wasn't sure if should have sucked it up and tried the roast beef sandwich instead. Sliders were, well sub par and basic. It was pretty dry and it came along with some fried onion flakes. I needed to douse it with some ketchup to help me swallow it. My meal also came along with a side salad, which was probably the better of the two. However, I found a few brown leaves and tried to work around it. \n\nService was good overall and the place was pretty well put together. Definitely a cool place to hang with the boys for a game. I went on Wolfey's website and notice they are fond of charitable work and non-profits coming to their place - Kudos!

I had been there once before for drinks on a Saturday night and recall having one before leaving as there wasnt anything close to a \"special\" or even a tavern priced beer that night.  But tonight was a Tuesday and I wasnt looking to drink.  I recalled the bartender raving about the grub that night a few months back so I figured I'd give it a shot.\n\nWe got seated outside and soon regretted it.  Surely we could have been re-seated, but it wasnt that big of a deal.  The tables seemed somehow lower than they should have been in relation to the bar nearby and there were a ton of kids playing bags nearby.  Oh well...not the end of the world.  I seem to recall that I was a kid once too...so I am cool with that most of the time.\n\nWaitress came.  She was OK.  Nothing too personable, but good enough I suppose.  I was trying to lay low on the carbs, so I asked her which she might suggest.  I was torn between some sort of a flat iron steak (which is more than I normally do on a weeknight) or the highlighted specialty beef sandwich.  She told me that the beef was on some sort of a salty pretzel roll.  She almost made it seem like that was the drawback but that the beef was awesome.  I said \"That bun sounds great...I'll just stick with the bottom half\" as a joke.  Once again, she knew I was laying low on the carbs because I told her in order to solicit her input.  \n\nWell this thing comes out open faced.  The bun was something.  It was probably far too salty for the average Joe but you could always brush some of the sea salt off.  But when I tell you that the amount meat on this open faced presentation was less than you would find on a $1.29 Arbys junior, I am not kidding.  Half of the bottom bun was even showing.  I could tell that when she set it down it was probably the first time she'd seen our order because she sort of looked like she was a little ashamed.  But obviously not ashamed enough to take it back to the kitchen and say to the boys \"WTF!  Are you trying to get me shut out of a tip here?\"  \n\nTruth is it had been a really long day and I didnt need to have the monster specialty sandwich that they seemed to describe in the menu, so I just let it slide.  It took about two minutes to polish it off so its no wonder that it seemed like forever for her to come back and realize that we were ready for the check.  \n\nNot the end of the world.  I'll live.  There is so much good dining here in town that its almost a shame that there is no time to give a place a second chance.  But I suppose that thats all the more reason that they should get it right each and every time.  They knew that this was a BS presentation of the sandwich that they were touting as their specialty.  \n\nMy date said as we left \"Now we know why they call it Wolfleys...\"  I asked why?  She said \"Because you leave hungry like the Wolfley...\"  I didnt even know she was around when Duran Duran was around!  Good one though.  Steer clear.of this place.

However, he does seem like the kind of guy I'd like to be having a beer with during the game rather listening to during a Cardinals game.

Yeah he sucks.  We've been trying to get him fired.  Make sure to complain to the manager.\"  Before I could even open my mouth she says, \"Oh wait, there's the manager.  Hold on a sec let me get her...\"  I'm sititng there like, well this got out of control quickly.  I'm thinking she is going to ask the manager to check on our drinks (all I want is a damn margarita!!!).  She comes back with manager and says \"These people want to talk to you about something.\"  Wow...... SO unprofessional.  I was shocked.  I told her I didn't want to complain, I just was seeing where our drinks were.   The rest of the night took forever.  We literally had a 2 hour and 30 minute dinner, all the while the manager is sitting down on a couch and can totally see how long we have been sitting there through the glass door.  A good manager would've known what to do in this situation.\n\nWord of advice Wolfley.... when you're away, make sure you hire managers you can trust.  The manager seemed way more interested on taking an extended break on the couch and gossiping with coworkers then worrying about your business.\n\nBottomline: We ended up feeling bad for Mike and gave him a good tip.

I found this place and am absolutely floored that Yelp let me down!  This wasn't a case of the kitchen having an off night.  I am honestly surprised that people enjoy any food coming from this place.\n\nAs we came here for wings, it was the first item on the menu I looked at.  There are 8 different flavors to choose from, but don't expect to ask for a sample.  Our waitress immediately stated that we couldn't sample any of the flavors without a $.50 per sauce surcharge.  When asked how hot, I was told they use Frank's Red Hot for their base.  Authentic and Original it ain't.  Portion size is either single or double, which is code for 10 (bone-in) or 20 wings.\n\nI ordered Bone-In and my friends got Bone-less and Chicken Cajun Sliders.  The wings were typical frozen chicken.  The Bone-less were frozen breaded fare I could get from any grocery freezer.  They were dry and bland.  The sauce was definitely heavy on Red Hot, making this one wing experience you can safely skip.  The bone-in wings were average size, and not something I would expect at a buck a piece.  \n\nThe sliders were dry.  The chicken was dry.  The cheese was dry.  The sauce was not a help.  There are only 3 sliders on a plate.  And everything was plated with a HEFTY dose of French's fried onions.  I am not sure why, because they certainly weren't tasty, and added nothing to the meal.  Even the wings came on a bed of french fried onions.\n\nYou would think the atmosphere would have made up for the terrible food.  There are a ton of TVs and Big Screens, perfect for sports fans.  Plenty of comfortable tables, and 3 outdoor patios.  A large bar takes up most of the West side of the building.  But somehow, we were let down again.  During an obviously big game night, we waited 40 minutes for a table when there were a DOZEN open tables all evening.  There was enough people to fill the restaurant, but obviously mgmt wasn't able to staff the establishment properly.  As a consequence, it took almost 30 minutes to get our food order in.

The staff was very helpful in placing the phone order and the food was ready promptly when we arrived.  I had ordered the steaken with provolone, green peppers mushrooms and a side of onion rings.  The onion rings were some of the best, probably #2 I've had in the valley.  I don't eat them all the time, but when I'm in the mood, nothing like a side of onion rings.  These were huge and had the perfect amount of breading and onion.  The steaken was ok, I mean it's huge on a 9 inch hoagie roll, but there should be like a choice of wheat or sourdough, and ummm where is the provolone and mushrooms?  BTW-something else is missing on this-- flavor.  Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, but I'd much rather have a 6 inch sandwich that has some shi-bang flavor than a 9 inch with ok flavor. On a sidebar, when I pay extra for additional items on the sandwich I should be able to see them.

I may suggest to wear aprons however.\n\n2.  Selection - Very nice - good choice of sauces, flavors, spice levels, fries, chicken fingers, boneless and basic wings.\n\n3.  Size of wings - Well, we all know that Grade A USDA Wings are plump and very meaty \"well to moderately fleshed\".  We also know that Grade B wings have a sufficient amount of flesh to prevent a thin appearance.  Guess what, we got a B here. You want your humans beings Grade B, and your wings Grade A.

Price - The price for 50 wings is 29.99 which is not bad, if it were grade A wings. you  would expect 50 wings to be somewhat heavy, I felt as if I was holding a bunch of ballons. Served in a generic container in a generic bag, not sure how this helps with their branding.\n\n6.  Taste - edible!  The polynesian style had an odd dark color, yet the flavor was acceptable.  The Garlic Parmesan, well, there was garlic taste and parmesan taste, just unfortunately a smattering and not well covered.\n\n7.  Tables - Plenty of room in this place, you can sit and eat as well. Odd that people just walk in and out of the back room without any uniform or acknowledgement. You don't know who works here or not.

Whether this \"Love Letter's special nutritional sweet and mild sauce\" really uses 20 different vegetables as ingredients is suspect, but I'll believe it just so I can rationalize this fried chicken is somewhat healthy.

Another note, the menu prices listed in the photos on the yelp page have changed...it's $2 CHEAPER for half/full orders.

Don't come here expecting Popeye's or KFC sized chicken pieces.  Perhaps I am too accustomed to American sized portions and steroid laced chickens...but the 6 pieces of chicken in the half order is probably equal to about a 3 piece meal at an American establishment.

They were fresh, sweet, and crunchy. I never had those things before. \n\nThe Korean Pizza was probably the best thing on the menu. It had sweet potatoes and Korean BBQ beef on it. The beef they got on the pizza is way better than 90% of the Korean restaurants in town. \n\nPersonally, I like the plain chicken over the one with the sauce. \n\nThe portions were pretty big, and they hand batter and fry your chicken the moment you order it. \n\nThis is a pure fusion style restaurant. They also give Tapatio with your chicken and pizza.   Lon L's review was 100% accurate about how the chicken wasn't your traditional Korean fried chicken.   Most Korean fried chickens are very similar to a American southern fried chicken, but with a hint of sesame oil and soy sauce. Traditional Korean fried chicken is prepared by battering the whole chicken without cutting the pieces apart, unlike in America where they batter the individual pieces. Then the whole chicken is flash fried in a pit of boiling oil. After only a couple of seconds they hand you the whole f*cking chicken still in one piece!\n\nWhen I was a little kid in California, I used to eat at this Korean fried chicken place that would actually deep fry the chicken in a combination of Vegetable and  Sesame oil. It was really good.  The chicken here at K-Juns tastes more similar to Tang Su Yuk(spelling). It's covered in a very sticky sweet-sour-spicy sauce. The good news for me is that I really like Tang Su Yuk, so ended up finding the chicken to be enjoyable. \n\nOriginally, I did not want to come here but, my Mom kept insisting on eating here when she came to town recently. My mom went weird a little over a decade ago. She started acting very oddly and her speech pattern became pretty disturbed and strange. While I was driving to Greenland market with her, we had two conversations. The first one was about \"starbucks coffee sent me a free drink coupon\". And the 2nd conversation was about how: \"A friend of mine who is Hawaiian said that K-Jun chicken was bad, so I don't want to eat there\". But, my Mom insisted that she wanted to try it. When we finally got there, she went up to the counter, and incoherently told the worker: \"Starbucks Chicken is bad Hawaiian food\". Now, everywhere my mom goes this happens.   And, everywhere we go people lose there patience with how nutty she is. Workers everywhere can't stand her and get really rude to her.  But, that didn't happen here at K Jun Chicken. The worker was very understanding and sensitive. He never got irritated, never laughed at her, or lost his patience. And he helped my Mom order exactly what she was looking for. It was very nice of him, and I appreciate his kindness. The respectful personality that this worker possesses is exactly what I would expect from a true East Asian person. There used to be a time when Asian-Americans had integrity and honor. We used to respect our elders and not make fun of the disabled. Nowadays a lot of Asian guys here in America(especially the ones around my age) talk all girly and act all snotty, passive-aggressive, and rude to each other. It's literally impossible  to get a long with them.  And a lot of Asian girls are like self-hating(especially at college campuses) and always rant about how they wish they were white and how \"the White man is the superior human being\". Like for example: I had a nightmare situation at a Korean owned sushi place in California where the self-hating Asian girl who was working there immediately let me know that she hated me for being Asian, male, and alive. She didn't even ask me about how many people where in my party, instead she just comes up to me and says all that. Then she kept coming back over and showing me pictures of her white boyfriend on her Iphone, and then started making remarks about how \"Asian guys are ugly and all look alike\". And at the end she made a comment about how Asian men \"oppress women\" and how \"it's not in the white man's nature to treat women badly\".  She wouldn't leave us alone! I believe that if my Mom came into that Sushi restaurant with her mental condition, the Asian chick would have kicked her out. The only reason I stayed was because the owner invited us there that day for a free meal.  And the only reason I haven't left a negative Yelp review on that place is because the owner used to be my next door neighbor. But, moral of this story is that you won't get that kind of treatment here at K-Juns. All you get is respect and good service from traditional East Asian workers. None of that f*cked up sh!t. \n\nOverall, I am happy I came into a Korean restaurant this time and didn't get dissed.

On the other hand though, this is an odd one. This used to be Philly Cheese Steak restaurant and it was one of those walk up or drive thru only type of deals that had no dining room. That store went down probably because of it's service. I remember that restaurant had a best Philly Cheese Steak of Las Vegas rating from the Las Vegas Review Journal for like 2 years in a row back in like 2001, 2002 or something like that. Then I remember ordering a a sandwich and waiting 45 freakin' minutes for a freakin turkey cheese steak sandwich and some fries. 45 freakin' minutes in somewhat cold weather because it was just turning into fall and I left the house without a jacket not thinking that it would be so cold, or that I would have to wait 45 freakin' minutes for one sandwich when I was the ONLY ONE standing in front of that place. I actually remember that when I was waiting for my order, a car that was ordering something through the drive thru cursed out one of the employees because he was waiting and it was his lunch break and he was pissed. Needless to say, that place got shut down a few months after. The had a decent sandwich but not worth 45 minutes of waiting... OUTSIDE!    IN LAS VEGAS!!!!! The conditions are never good outside here. It's either too hot, too cold, or windy as hell....It stayed shut down for about 3 years. \n \n   I believe it was somewhere around this time last year when Church's Chicken took over. I don't remember ever going to a Church's Chicken so I figured I'd give it a try. Initially I wanted to dine in but I soon realized that they didn't have a dining room. Either way, I wanted to try it and I walked up to the window. This was around 6-7pm, right in the middle of the night time rush and the window is facing one of the busiest streets in Vegas, Nellis Blvd....PLUS it was windy outside so I basically had to yell my order at the guy three times before he was able to hear what I said and he had to repeat it to me just a many times till he got the #whatever with the beans and extra corn, or whatever I ordered right. \n\n   As bad as that was, there was already two people that ordered before me. I guess the first person ordered a large order and had to wait a bit for her order. I think she ordered a bucket of something or an office trash can or whatever they put 20 pieces of chicken in. Anyway, both the person after her and eventually my orders came before hers and every time the window would open, that lady would walk up to the window and say \"that's not my order\". Well she was right but they never called her order for pick up in the first place. She did that again with my order and asked where the chicken was ( I ordered some chicken finger meal that all fit in one bag) and once again the guy had to say that it wasn't her order. Again. \n\n   I already was not liking this place, but I got my order and took it home. I ordered a meal that had the chicken strips, fries, a biscuit and a piece of corn..... The corn was good.... The chicken strips were really dry and all I remember was that NEEDED to eat it with the BBQ sauce and as soon as I ran out I stopped eating the chicken. The fries were garbage. They were this mix of being soggy and hard at the same time. It's as if they fried them and let them sit in the fryer but turned the heat off and just let them sit there. I barely even ate those fries. The biscuit was good though. They have those biscuits with the honey-butter baked into them. I wish I had some extra honey to spread on it instead of butter. The corn was...well it was corn. If they screwed that up then I would have left my house with that corn in my hand, go back to the store and break that window with it but luckily for them it was good. After all, all they had to do was throw it in some boiling water for a while. \n\n   Overall, I just did not like the place. I know that I didn't get the signature chicken wings that you're supposed to go there for but I still got something they were offering on their menu so either do it good or don't do it at all.

The seasoning on the chicken(same on the fries too, I think) may throw people off, and times be a little salty, and the bare bones place could use a solid cleaning, but people keep coming in and getting wings and chicken by the container full to go, and the price point here is not bad at all. \n\nIn the meantime in between time, I'll keep searching, maybe return for some wings or gizzards!...:9  ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu  3.75\n\n*Good service, tasty birds, and prices are a steal, but place could be cleaner...", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 4, "useful": 9, "cool": 7}}, {"text": "Amazing is all I can say!

Every time we drove by we always said the same thing. \"Sunny's Chicken and Fish? Sounds good but the place looks kind of shady\". Well folks, let me be the first one to tell you that it's not shady at all. We stopped by around 6:30 for dinner and never felt any safer. It's really not a shady place.\n\nNow to the important stuff.  All I gotta say is get the Fried Catfish plus the Chicken n Waffles no matter what. \n\nThe Catfish ($5.99) has two options. Southern, which is basically cajun, and Beer Battered. Both are very good.  The cajun style has a cornmeal/pepper spice to it while the beer battered option gives you the crispy coating with good flavor. Comes with fries which is also decent. I love both options because when you bite into either one, you can taste the flavor of the catfish and you can tell that it was freshly seasoned or battered right before getting dumped in the fryer. The freshness of the fish is evident in every bite. I know some places you might get that sandy, bottom of the ocean taste but here its non existent.\n\nThe Chicken n Waffles ($3.99). OMG. I dont know what it is exactly what it is that coats the chicken but damn, I could eat that by itself. While I was savoring that, I almost forgot that there was a waffle that came with it. By the end of the meal, it didnt matter what I was dipping in the syrup, it all tasted good put together. Oh, you also get some hot sauce too just in case the syrup is not your thing or if its simply not enough.\n\nAs for the comments on this place being not too attractive, I compare it to that nice, quiet, nerd type librarian with glasses and the hair tied up. Once you get to know them and they open up to you, they are actually very attractive with their rich personality. You know what they say. It's always the quiet ones that surprise you. \n\nSome random info. They take cards. There's no bathroom. At least there is a nice sink for you to wash your hands with after you are done licking your fingers from all the flavor.\n\nSo in closing, always have an open mind in trying things out for the first time especially when something seems sketchy. This place is a diamond in the rough, hole in the wall, etc. Whatever cliche you want, it fits. Will be back with lots of other people. As a matter of fact, I ordered more food to take home to my family and they loved it! Memo to Roscoe.

Goes awesomely with the bleu cheese.\n-Teriyaki: Pretty much what you'd expect from the name. Standard teriyaki wing sauce. If this is your thing, it's not bad.

It blows most wings you have tried in your life out of the water. The deal for endless wings is great ($12.99 all you can eat). \n\nThe wings come breaded and fried, never cold or nasty-tasting.  They are very crispy and have a great texture. There are several sauces: regular wing sauce with varying degrees of spice and a few other ones (Honey BBQ, teriyaki, sweet chili garlic, sweet and sour, etc.). The regular wing sauces come with a nice buttermilk ranch as well, not the mayo-based sauce other places might serve. The wings are very big and meaty, not very tiny. They give you bigger portions in your first round and afterwards shrink it down. Not exactly what some may like, but it is all-you-can-eat  and it is less wasteful in case you overestimated your appetite. \n\nI have to also recommend the fries. They come very crispy and thin. These have to be among the best tasting fries I've had as well. They don't give you sauce for these fries, you have to get it over at the condiments counter but the side benefit is they also serve fry sauce and in case you want to dip it in ranch, there usually is enough left afterwards for dipping. There is a drink fountain (Coke-based) and a tea machine for those who would rather partake in that instead. \n\nNormally, the service for this place is decent; my only complaint is that sometimes the waiters can screw up the sauce you have, but bringing it up with them usually fixes the problem. I have to commend the employees (an older brunette and a young cook with a buzz cut) that worked yesterday. Although it was very busy and understaffed, they did not lose their cool and kept the service with a smile. I hope the managers do, however, at least adequately staff the place for the busier times.

Good size crowd taking up most of the tables, got our pitcher, and chilled for about 10 minutes till we got our food.

If the restaurant does not have the food on the menu it should not be offered. I informed the server of my displeasure and mentioned there is no way i can pay $12.95 for that and of course she offered me to order something else but at this time the other 5 in the family now have their meals. The waitress was wonderful and took off a couple drinks from the bar and gave us two cards for free parmesan fries which I will never use but the kids may because it's free.

The reason why I've been MIA lately is because I haven't been going out anywhere except one specific place, and that place is Wings Edinburgh.  \n\nI was initially reluctant about writing this review because the place is seriously a hidden gem, but after three weekends in a row (told you I literally haven't been going anywhere else) I talked about it with the server and she was extremely happy for me to do so.  And Wings Edinburgh is worth the advertisement.  \n\nFirst, how it all happened.  See, my husband and I had heard about such a place from some mates but had never sought it out.  Then, one rugby day after one-too-many pints we decided to take an adventure and find it.  So we dragged ourselves up the hill on Victoria St. and suddenly found ourselves in front of a tiny sandwich board that just said 'Wings'.  Walk down the dark alley that when slightly intoxicated seems like a trip to Narnia (stone cold sober it feels like the middle of a slasher movie) and you'll find yourself in front of a blue door.  Enter and get ready to eat.  \n\nThe premise is extremely simple.  The menu is wings, only wings, and you can choose between two dozen flavours/dry rubs/sauces.  Each bowl comes with 6 wings in the sauce/rub of your choice, you chow down and put the bones in a bucket on the table.  That's it, pure and simple.  My favourites?  No Big Dill (Caesar dressing and dill) and the Smoked Emperor (a delicious bbq sauce).  The Tiger Wings are fantastic as well.  They've got both sweet and spicy options, and you can mix-and-match whatever flavours you desire.  As for drinks, again simple.  There's about 6 different options for bottled beer, no draft.  The cheapest is Corona for 2.50.  They also do water and milk for the really spicy sauces.  As for prices, a bowl of six wings is 3 each, but on Sundays get ready: 10 for all you can eat!  All the wings your heart desires for 10 pounds.  Big plays.  Feel like a challenge?  They have a Wall of Flame.  Eat 6 wings covered in the suicide sauce and get your picture on the wall.  I had a tiny taste of the sauce and almost died.  65 people have tried the challenge and only 11 people have succeeded.  So good luck with that.  Also, starting next weekend they're starting a count of their most wing eating customers.  \n\nWings Edinburgh is, at the moment, only open Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and you have to check the facebook page to see what time they open (two weekends ago they opened at 4, last Sunday it was 2 [seriously, wasn't joking when I said this is the only place I've been in three weeks]).  And I'm also not joking when I say the place is as simple as it gets.  The wings come in a paper bowl, there's no cutlery, and the only two people that work there are the server and the cook.  If you want a fancy dinner out on the town, this is not your place.  Going on a first date?  You'll have sauce all over your face, maybe not the best (or maybe it is, if so keep that person around they're awesome).  They only serve wings- no burgers, no chips, no salad, just wings.  But if that's what you're after, this is the place.  And it's seriously worth it.\n\nIf you go look for me, I'll probably be there since I can't keep away.  This is seriously one of those hidden gems that makes Edinburgh such a fantastic city.  Next weekend head over to Victoria St. and be on the lookout for a tiny sandwich board, you won't be disappointed.\n\n(the facebook link won't work in the business website place, so here it is- click on it to find opening times and news/information)\nhttps://www.facebook.com/wings.edinburgh?ref=ts&fref=ts", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 4, "useful": 11, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "This is what I have been waiting for!!! Finally chicken wings in Edinburgh!!\n\nI am a huge fan of chicken wings. Chicken wings and beer - what a perfect combination. I grew up Niagara Falls, Canada just a stones throw away from Buffalo, New York where 'buffalo wings' were created. In North America, it's very typical to go out for beer and wings. Or to go out and enjoy all-you-can-eat wings. This is one thing I have greatly missed since moving here and I am SO glad that this place finally exists in Edinburgh.\n\nWings gives it to you straight up. It's just wings and beer. Oh and chips but you don't want chips - you come here for the wings. They have over 40 different flavours of sauces/dry rubs. I came on Friday night with my partner and we tried seven of the forty. It's 3 pounds for 6 wings. \n\nMy favourites: Julius the Hot (caesar and Frank's red hot dressing), No big dill (dill and a white cream type dressing), and another one that was essentially a cheesy creamy cheese with FRESH* jalapenos. We also tried the a super hot flavour that's mixed with maple syrup. It was tasty. They have 'suicide' flavour - 11 people out of 65 were able to eat them. If you can handle some heat I urge you to try it out!\n\nThese wings are deep fried, American, buffalo wing style. They are perfect. This is a great place to come with friends before heading out. \n\nLike Kristin C. noted below, this isn't a date spot. It's located in the basement of Mariachi's. There are two people who work here, the cook and the server. The server is Canadian and super friendly!\n\nYou'll wake up the next morning and your fingers will smell like chicken wings (but that's fine). They do all-you-can-eat on Sundays for 10 pounds. Who knows I might be back today!\n\nThis is my new favourite place in Edinburgh.

We saw the sign luring us in near Mariachi the Mexican restaurant, leading us down to their side courtyard and into a black door labeled 'wings!' Ever intrigued, we kept going into this 'secret' wing den. We were warmly greeted by one of the co-owners and she kindly explained every sauce on the menu for us, and helped me choose the sweet and unique-sounding Sweet Vanilla sauce for my wings, whilst Mason chose the Hot Oriental sauce. The guys at a nearby table were at the end of completing the spicy wing challenge (and succeeded!) and the place was great and chilled out with playing Nintendo 64 as entertainment.\n\nWhen our wings came, Mason was thrilled with his savoury chicken wings and I loved my sweet, sugary vanilla ones! It was a great value for just \u00a33 for a bowl of six wings, and it felt like a little home away from home. On Sundays they even have all-you-can-eat wings for only \u00a310! The place is only open from Friday to Sunday, and the people here really are passionate about wings and really cool innovative sauces. That's what they do and they are great at it! In the summer, it would be amazing to sit out in their courtyard and relax with wings and the \u00a32.50 Coronas. We will definitely be back...

They advised that there was a wall with previous winners (of which some are possibly to be discharged from hospital, we joked) I was presented with a bright red dish swimming in chili seeds and a sauce that by the smell of it could easily double as an industrial paint stripper.

First off, when going here, doing be alarmed / confused. It is down a wee alley beside Mariachi, and the door isn't open. It's on your left as you get to the bottom of the wee alley, and just has a sign that says 'Wings'. Nothing else.

Needless to say there were no left-overs.\n\nI threw the last chicken wing bone in the bucket thinking that if I didn't have to go back to work, I would have gone for at least two more dozen wings dipped in all kinds of exotic sauces.\n\nI've had chicken wings a million times, and there's only so much one can do with chicken wings. \n\nYet you entertained me, you fed me well, your posters are awesome, your toilets are clean, and you make your own tortilla chips.\n\n5 stars was the least I could give you.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nNik", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 5, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "I *really* like wings.  The problem is, most of the time you get wings and they're boiled or something and the fat is all blobby and gross and you've got to pick through to get to the meat and it's often a mediocre experience.\n\nAnd then Wings came along.\n\nIt's been on my radar to try for a while but when I got a free bowl status I knew it had to get to the top of the list quickly.  I roped in a fellow wing-lover and we hunted out the random spot off the Mile and discovered the, larger than I expected it would be, home of wings.\n\nThe venue itself isn't much to write home about.  It's a bit chilly, a bit damp, and not as nice as the pictures of their original location suggest.  If they are allowed, I would suggest going for red walls like in the original location. \nBut, the staff are nice and welcoming, the beers are \u00a32.50, and the wings are good.  The wings are actually really *really* good.  They're crispy.  I have never before had wings with such tasty crispy skin that just begs eating.  \n\nWe shared three bowls of wings (something sweet and spicy, the Canadian BBQ, and the garlic parmesan) and some chips, and when it all arrived I said I wished we had ordered more.  By the end, though, we were amazingly stuffed.  \n\nIf we hadn't had a free bowl, 18 wings, chips and 2 beers would have cost us \u00a317.50.  Under a tenner each for dinner and a drink is pretty good these days.  \n\nSo, I now join the leagues of wing-loving fans and am planning my return trip.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 5, "useful": 11, "cool": 9}}, {"text": "I'm not even going to get into my craving for fried chicken which is in a very sad state here in the Burgh' but Wings have filled a small crevice in that hole!

Our waiter was from Texas (total perfection) we understood each other perfectly. When we asked for ranch he listed off about 5 different ranch flavored dips.

Wings is indeed a great idea but that doesn't mean there's not room for improvement.\n\nMy main criticism would be of the \"dry rub\" wings. I'd always though a rub was applied to raw chicken so that the flavours permeate the meat as it cooks. This dry rub appears to be applied to the chicken wing after it was cooked delivery a flavour of raw spices. Personally I would't order any of these options again.\n\nAll other portions I tried were enjoyable but there is a sense that the wings are pre-cooked, reheated and then have a pre-prepared sauce applied. I'd really prefer to see everything made fresh to order and would happily wait a little longer for my food to arrive.\n\nOn the whole I enjoyed the experience and will most likely return at some point in the future.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "If you love chicken wings then you have found your heaven!! \n\nThis is the first time I have been since it has opened on New Fishmarket Close, and I have to say that the new space is much better and very quirky.

The interior of the restaurant, if that is even the right word, is nothing fancy, which suits the food and atmosphere well. It feels like you are tucked into someone's living room with random nerdy sci-fi posters and mis-matched chairs and tables. It really feels like a college bar that serves that hot wings American's love. \n\nThe lovely waitress was very helpful in checking we knew they only served wings, although a few vegetarian options, and they serve chips, I would never bring a non-meat eater here. Entirely pointless. They were fairly busy, but our wings came out pretty quickly and all were hot and looked killer! It is a very casual environment and an equally chill dining experience. They also offer the standard beer and small spirit drinks to wash down your feed.\n\nThey have a good range of sauces and styles or rubs or spices for the wings, and with each sauce you get 6 wings for 3.50, served in a paper bowl, slathered in sauce. We opted for the Mardi Gras Madness, the traditional Louisiana Hot Sauce wing, the Mam Prickin Amazing, Sriracha Chipolte Wing, the Tiger Sauce (Buffalo striped smooth) and although not traditional maybe, I got the Dill-licious, maple and dill barbecue wing.\nAll were well fried perfectly and sauced to perfection. The best was definitely the Mardi Gras madness, smothered in Franks Hot Sauce, it was the true buffalo wing I would expect. All were quite tasty and we were both madly happy. \n\nIt is a no-fuss, delicious experience, where you get exactly what you expect and even a bucket to discard the remains of your wings experience.
