Drumsticks - BBQ sauce is too sticky and thick and it gummed up on my teeth. It was like it had been sitting out and then reheated... meh. I gave them away.\n3. Artichoke/ spinach dip - It would have been better to have chopped up spinach and not leaves of spinach... it is very hard to scoop up leaves of spinach onto your chip. Otherwise flavor was good just feasibility was a failure.\n4. Crab cake - it sure it pure crab basically which was good but the flavor was the opposite... I questioned whether it was bad...  1/2 of it tasted good and then the other  1/2 had a distinctly different flavor like it was too fishy... My dinner buddy ordered the same thing and his was frozen in the middle! Unacceptable.\n5. Southwest potato salad - this was actually very good! It's a light alternative to traditional heavy mayo potato salad. This one does not have mayo but instead a sun dried tomato-based sauce with onion, celery mixed in. \n6. Turkey club - choice of side and I got the seasoned fries which were good. The turkey club was also good but just overwhelmingly tasted like butter because the Texas toast style bread was SOAKED in butter... I ordered all the sandwiches from then on without butter.\n7. Coconut Crusted Halibut - on top of a bed of rice with black beans which was good. The halibut was just ok... not very flavorful. \n8. NY strip 12 oz - very good!  Comes with a choice of side and I chose the cheese stuffed pepper that is also very good! The best dish I've had at Harry's!\n9. Salmon - did not try this but on one night my friends' at 2 separate dinner parties had the salmon and got sick. They did say it tasted funny. Watch out!  I hope they notified the staff...\nSERVICE: Hit or miss here. They can't handle a large crowd so if it's busy don't bother. Many times I had to go find my server to let them know we need to order.

Hit or miss food... I don't understand how the food can be very good at Mission Grille and suck so much at Harry's when the food is coming from the same kitchen.

Perhaps not to the taste of people who want a pint with a great deal of depth, but I suspect it would be a great post work pint.

They took pride in the presentation of the (sometimes off-the-menu and custom-made) drinks they served and took aims to make sure their customers enjoyed themselves.\n\nWhen an establishment asks its customers to pay between $7 and $12 per drink, customers are paying for more than alcohol.

Even when it was full (as it often was on the weekends), the place retained its lounge atmosphere, and patrons respected this image by dressing-up/dressing well (though the unwashed hipster look was also welcomed).\n\nThat is what Opus was before the new ownership.

The music has changed to something more befitting of a dance floor, often too loud to hear your date or friends speak. Monday nights are now \"game nights\"-- patrons can now play Monopoly and checkers in a dimly-lit martini bar.

And frankly, the beer selection was shit and the tapas were shittier.\n\nI'm sure that Opus is good at what it specializes in. The nearly all-female clientele on any given night is an attestation to the fact that if you're at Opus, you're there for the fancy-looking sweet cocktails. The cocktail menu is impressively large and creative, with something for everyone who likes paying $12 a drink.\n\nIf you want beer though, they've got about 4 or 5 on tap and an equally unimpressive bottle selection. I applaud them for bringing in a couple unique Belgians but, as you might expect, one was fruit-flavored with a low alcohol content and cost twice as much as a regular beer.\n\nWhat really bothered me about Opus is the quality of food they're serving. I got a decent spread of tapas and found that I didn't just have a bad dish or two. The crappy food quality is present in everything.\n\nFirst off, portions are massive. So that's the first strong indicator that you're not being served \"tapas,\" you're being served \"frozen appetizers.\" Tapas are small portions that have been expertly cooked and cared for, with an attention to detail that is not at all present in Opus' food. So it's pretty clear that they write \"tapas\" on their menu for the snooty foreign-sounding effect, and that is just plain deceptive at best.\n\n\nGoing through dish by dish I can tell you that all the Asian-style tapas were absolute garbage. The spring rolls were extremely soggy and contained a bitter mixture of gooey black \"vegetables.\" The tempura was greasy and very unappetizing; I had no desire to finish it at all. \n\nBut the worst offender was the cheese fondue which, in addition to being served in a bowl comically heated by a tiny tealight candle, was way too bitter for enjoyment. By the end it was less a fondue moreso than it was a bowl of gross melted cheese and half-and-half. The selection of items for dipping was strange and included several ingredients that I was disgusted by earlier.\n\nAll that aside I can end on one good note with the food, which I found in the goat cheese crostini. While the goat cheese itself was not much better than anything you can grab in the grocery store, the tapenade and vinaigrette topping that crostini were excellent redeeming qualities. Both were just a little sweet and a lot savory, imparting a unique and delicious flavor. And that's saying a lot about the tapenade because I tend to dislike olives. \n\nSo, again, to summarize. Nice and overpriced cocktails. Almost everything else is absolute shit.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "After reading a few of the Yelp reviews and seeing the menu when I first arrived I was concerned that this would be a menu driven cocktail lounge lacking any real creativity.

As I scanned the booze behind the bar I saw what I thought were too many flavored vodkas, but then, who doesn't have too many flavored vodkas these days?  The menu was also full of what sound like fruity, girly drinks and, my pet peeve, is called a martini menu (a martini is a cocktail, and this was a cocktail menu!).  \n\nFortunately, Marilyn, the bartender on duty, came to the rescue and patiently demonstrated that she and Opus have real cocktail chops.  I ended up sampling three of the menu items, the Dill Collins, an interesting riff on the classic Tom Collins which was very refreshing on a warm summer evening,  Next was the Royal Highness featuring Plantation rum and egg white among its ingredients.  Yes, I said egg white, and when a bar is mixing cocktails with egg white they get my full attention!  This drink evoked visions of tiki torches and tropical beaches for me.  The third menu item was the Pimm'd Up Bondurant.  Only the second cocktail I've seen anywhere using the venerable Pimm's No. 1 and it was delicious.\n\nI finished the night with an off menu drink from Marilyn that featured Laphroiag scotch, ginger and lemon flavors.

It's like they took a sand castle bucket and filled it with pure Scotland (see the photo, see it now!) - absolutely delicious. The little tweaks they make to classic gastro dishes is pretty interesting, such as the Marie Rose sauce on a pork burger.

He is one of those guys who makes a ton of money, and is always surrounded by hot chicks who worship the ground he walks on. Literally, all his friends are either cocktail waitresses at Bellagio and Wynn, and they practically are all over him all the time. Also, Aaron is one of those guys who are immune to getting drunk. He can literally out drink the whole country of Ireland. Personally, I believe he is a great role model for the Asian-American people. \n\nThe sliders were my favorite. They come with these marbleized onions, and blue cheese crumbles. Also they got these home made potato chips that they hand slice and deep fry.

Why does everyone always accuse me of being a womanizer?\n\nThe cook is the coolest guy ever!! He is a comic book artist who is moonlighting to pay his kids through college.  The guy has worked for every famous comic company(DC, Marvel, etc).

I've been going there at least once a week since then (sometimes up to four times a week). \n\nFirst of all, the wait and bar staff is extremely friendly and personable. I really like going there because of this. They will definitely remember your name if you frequent this place enough (of course, I'm sure they're paid to do so). Nevertheless, they seem very genuine about it and I always feel very comfortable going there.\n\nFor a bar that is themed like many others in Las Vegas (fairly dark, video poker machines, many televisions, some times very smokey) BJ's doesn't have a dive feel at all. It definitely is very clean, new and nicely decorated and I consider it much more upscale than par for Las Vegas.\n\nA friend of mine and I frequent BJ's for lunch and happy hour. They have deals for both times. At lunch, they have a $10 lunch menu that's actually, for the most part, worth the $10. I've had pretty much all of the burgers offered on the lunch menu (they're generally always cooked to preference). All have been good. The BBQ bacon burger is very good - thick patty, cooked to order and the bacon does not disappoint. The personal pizzas are also very good as well and more than enough for one person to eat. The only time I was not pleasantly surprised with my meal was with the mushroom burger. The mushrooms tasted a little too \"wild\" for me and under-cooked. However, this could be that I just don't like mushrooms that much since I rarely eat them. I guess you learn something everyday.\n\nMy favorite item on the menu is the Prime Rib Dip sandwich. This is offered on the $10 lunch menu. It's a very sizable sandwich with juicy roast beef on a baguette roll smothered in onions and Swiss cheese. Additionally, it comes with a cappuccino cup full of Au jus, an excellent garlic horseradish sauce, freshly cooked potato chips and is really quite amazing.\n\nThe happy hour BJ's offers is also extremely good. All drinks are half price from 4pm to 7pm. They also offer a decent assortment of $5 appetizers. A Dogfish Head IPA will run you only $3 at happy hour (opposed to 6-8 bucks at the few local places that actually have it). A Coors Light (or equivalent) will run you under a $1.50. I've really only eaten the chicken wings at happy hour, but they are pretty good as well. They're not breaded or fried, but grilled and slightly charred (different but a nice departure from basics).\n\nAll in all, I would probably give BJs 5 stars, but I'm still reserving that for a place that I would deem \"perfect\".

The only negatives I can think of are that you are paying extra for the luxury of having food delivered to you, and since you're at the very top and back of the theater in the balcony area, you don't have any sound coming from behind you which really makes a noticeable difference.\n\nThey have two different restaurants there, both offering similar foods. The 347 Grill has a really neat water feature surrounding it where bubbles change colors. I know it's just bubbles, but I could honestly sit there for hours staring at this if they wouldn't arrest me and take me away. They have a couple of neat entr\u00e9es, including lobster mac & cheese which is delicious and I totally recommend it. Don't expect to be able to pop in get some food and pop out to your movie though. This is typical restaurant times we're talking about here. Typically 30 to 40 minutes to get food. The service is hit and miss leaning a bit more towards miss. It almost seems like servers hide from you... I never seem to be able to find one when I need one. When I do though, they're usually really friendly. Perhaps, when I go they're just stretched thin.\n\nThe second restaurant upstairs is more of a sports bar. Lots of TVs everywhere, and a more sports bar geared menu. A little bit smaller, with bar favorites. The drinks are always ice cold, and the service is always prompt and very friendly. I've never had any trouble getting the seats which is another plus! From up there, you can look down and see people bowling, which is a good way to pass the time if you're not into whatever's on TV at that moment. They also have a small patio outside with a couple of tables and TVs where I believe you can smoke.\n\nSpeaking of the bowling alley, It's fun! I'm DEFINITELY not a professional bowler by any means. I'd hardly say I'm an amateur. But I do have fun bowling with my friends and family. For people with small children or for other folks like me in wheelchairs, they have rails that they can set up so you can roll your ball down easier. They also have bumpers that can go up or down automatically depending on which player is up at the moment. After bowling at some older facilities, I think that's a huge deal! Everybody else can bowl without the bumpers, and I can throw them up, so I don't roll a gutter every other time. Food is definitely popular throughout the entire complex, and it's offered here as well. They have a small selection of appetizers, as well as pizza. You can also get drinks served. The servers always seem to be stretched thin here, So if you see one, flag them down as soon as possible so you can get your order in. During the week, you pay for each game, however, on Friday and on the weekend, you pay by the hour. This can be good or bad depending on how fast you want to bowl. I would think it would hurt their food sales because everybody would be in such a rush to bowl they wouldn't want to take time to eat. You can pick up shoes for a couple bucks if you need them. They also offer a promotion where if you see a different color pin in the one position, and you get a strike, you win cash.\n\nI really wish I could provide a review on the laser tag arena, however, since I'm in a wheelchair, I'd make an easy target! Maybe I'll go in there someday just to check it out, but for now, let's focus this review elsewhere.\n\nThe arcade has enough games to keep your kids busy while you're finishing dinner or having a drink at the 347 Grill adjacent to it. It's definitely not up to the level of the Gameworks, or D&B but there's definitely some good Time killers in there. They keep the area clean which is a plus.\n\nOverall, it's definitely worth a visit!\n\nP.S. Say goodbye to your cellular signals.

The beans are the perfect consistency (not too runny, not too thick) and the rice has great flavor and big chunks of tomato and onion. \nAlso worth of a shoutout are the salsa (chunky with really good flavor) and the macaroni salad that you can get with certain meals (its home made I believe). \nDownsides are that they charge you for more than one bowl of chips and salsa sometimes (I think if you are on their good side, they will not charge you), and their chili rellenos suck!!! Whatever you do, don't order them. I guess the inside and outside of the building could use some spucing up as well. \nThis place is an institution in AZ and in our family.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "The place is probably not the best looking restaurant you can find in Mesa.

The beef was seasoned very well and a dollop of sour cream cooled down the tasty fire their red hot sauce brings to the dish.

First, let me start by saying, I have waited nearly a week to cool down and write this.  In addition, I have worked in the restaurant industry for over six years.  I have cocktailed, managed, waited in fine dining and bartended.  This place is totally overrated, they need to shut down, hire new staff, and start over.  \n\nI went here last Friday night with some girlfriends for my birthday.  From the minute I walked in, I knew it was going to be a bad experience.  My party had already arrived and been sat, but I didn't know where and no thanks to the retarded hostesses that failed to greet me, took me 10 minutes just to find my party in the giant mess.  The place was WAY too crowded, the staff couldn't even get around and their sections were clearly too big for them. Once I found my friends on the patio, which is lovely, it took another 10 minutes for a waitress to greet us, and then another 10 for her to come back and take our drink order.  She then arrived with an appetizer my friends had ordered previous to my arrival but failed to bring silverware or plates.  Well, the spinach dip looked good, not sure how it tasted because by the time she remembered, it was cold.  After this it took another good 15 minutes just to order dinner and I figured I better get a drink in while I had the chance.  Food arrived, by now we actually had eating utensils.  The food was OK, nothing spectacular.  I had the shrimp appetizer and hummus, friends had the chicken sandwich, sweet potatoe fries and a cheese quesadilla (not many veggie options), oh and they charged her $9 for it.  The food was nothing to write home about.  After our meal was finished was when things got really bad.  \n\nA woman came up and asked for one of our chairs, we told her someone was sitting there, and her response was, \"I just don't understand where all of our f-ing chairs went\".  My immediate reaction was 1) you work here? 2) did you really just talk to a guest that way? and 3) I don't give a rats @$$ where your chairs are, stop interupting my birthday dinner and move along, that is not a problem for us to solve.  She started to step away, look around, and then had the audacity to return to the table, demand the chair from us and continue to argue with me.  I told her that my friend was in the restroom, she was still sitting there, which should have been evident by the fact that her dirty plate (along with all of ours) was still on the table, and her purse was in the chair and I demanded to speak to a manager.  Needless to say, she went away in a huff.  \n\nAt this point we decided it was time to leave.  Waited another 10-15 minutes for the check, only to have a birthday brownie and candle arrive as I was standing up to leave.  Where was that 20 minutes ago when we were finished with dinner?  Oh, and by the way, bad waitress, you took all of my silverware away.  At this point I told the waitress about all of the issues, the manager never did appear, maybe they don't have one, it sure would explain a lot.  She did offer to comp one of our appetizers, but at this point I didn't care, she had already charged us our bill!  To top it all off, as I was leaving, the hostess and wine steward/manager/not sure but he was in a suit, were having a playful little fight in which they were slapping each others butts and bending over....great first impression, and last might I add, in the entry way.  After the girl almost slapped me I politely excused myself and walked around her to exit the place, NEVER to come back.  \n\nThere are so many better places in the valley to go: Postino, Chelsea's, Radio Milano, Portlands, Barrio Cafe, La Grande Orange, Houston's, Merc Bar, Zen 32, Tarbell's, City Hall, Rokerji, Phoenix City Grill, Sierra Bonita, etc., all within a few miles, why would I bother coming to this yuppie place ever again?

She argued me and I quickly responded with the fact that eight people getting sick is no coincidence. As a manager in the past, it's right to sympathize with the customer, not defend.

Housed along 40th Street just south of Indian School, The Vig is a neighborhood tavern offering up a casual yet modern atmosphere with great drinks and well priced eats. All of these perks have their downside, the parking. If you go early you can get a spot otherwise, it's pretty much valet only, so don't forget a few bucks for a tip.\n\nAsk to be sat on the modish patio if you can, weather permitting. On my last visit the patio was vibrant with an attractive 30-something crowd. Once you're sat, the service is friendly and outgoing with well-paced timing between drinks and food.\n\nThe menu layout is fairly straightforward though all over the place in terms of style. Seems the chef is going for a broad appeal venturing from Greek to Italian with some Indian and Mexican influences thrown in. This tends to be a plus and a minus depending on your personal tastes.\n\nA good example of this was the Flatbread Pizza with Tandoori Chicken ($10). Topped with baby spinach, sun dried tomatoes, paneer cheese, pear-cardamom chutney on naan bread; the pizza was complex and delicious. The sweet flavor of the chutney and tomato was a nice contrast to the savory chicken, cheese and crust.\n\nMore of a straightforward choice was the Trifecta ($10). You get three perfectly cooked mini burgers draped with American cheese, grilled onions, pickles and spicy mayo, served with French fries. Classic Americana, you can never go wrong with burgers and fries.\n\nI didn't really understand the take on the Carne Asada on a Potato Pancake ($15). There are slices beautiful medium rare carne asada with guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream, cotija cheese and roasted tomato sauce, then they put it all atop a potato pancake. I guess I appreciate the creativity of the idea though it's not like you can pick it up and eat it like a taco. Believe me, this would have been wholeheartedly welcome since the potato pancake was waterlogged.\n\nAnother complete misfire was the Frenchy ($13). Their take on warm roast prime rib, pile it high on a gorgeous French roll then cover with fontina cheese and served with a side of au jus. Sounds like the perfect sandwich in theory, but to my disappointment, it was unsatisfying. Something went terribly wrong here since the meat was so perfectly cooked and tender, however it was completely void of flavor. The au jus echoed this, simply a cup of unseasoned beef stock. The only saving grace was the chewy French roll and the fontina; maybe a grilled cheese would have been better? The sweet potato fries that came with the sandwich had a perfectly crunchy exterior with a sweet and fluffy interior, some of the best I've had.\n\nEven with a few food misses, the service, vibe and overall cool factor making The Vig a great place for a date or just to hang out.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 3, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "I enjoy the feel of this place - especially during the cooler weather.

I could be saying too much, because the Scottsdale douchebag crowd may catch on and disrupt our awesome neighborhood hangout. I LOVE spending my Sunday afternoons drinking a few beers here. The patio on Sundays is the place to be. Get there before 2:30 if you have any hopes of getting a table. After 3, the band, and thus the party gets underway, and it becomes a good time.\n\nI've been coming here since before it was \"cool\" to be here. I've watched it slowly morph into a slightly confused too much to too many sort of place. It seems as though they don't know who, or what they are. The food, because of this crazy loss of direction has become \"eh\" quality. The menu is confusing, just in the read, then when you get this plate of confusion fusion, well, it just leaves too much on the plate. Again, I go back to the point that it is trying to be too much to too many. There are too many things going on in the dishes. Not in a bold, rich, dynamic, wow! sort of way, but in a \"HELP ME! I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TASTING BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MUCH GOING ON!\" sort of way. \n\nI suggest: Because I love the feel and vibe of this place. \nSettle down! Simplify the menu. Focus on making simple, flavorful and quality food.  This is a neighborhood bar, not a 5-star bistro. The Turkey sandwich is a perfect example of screwing up a fantastically simple, good eating, sandwich. The crab artichoke dip is hated by those who serve it, and incredibly bland to those who order and eat it. Take the simplicity of that dish, and figure out how to enhance the flavors in it. \n\nAs far the service goes: I've had great service, and I've had abysmal service. Guess it's a hit and miss sort of thing. I will say that Scott is the best it gets there, and I make it a point to get into his section. Management has been rude to me on several occasions with a nose high attitude. I was asked to relinquish my table because my party hadn't shown up. Nothing that a polite, \"No. I will not.\" wouldn't fix, however. \n\nBottom line here: If you're looking for a fun place to grab a beer or glass of wine, and maybe a burger, with a great vibe, and fun people, this is the place.

Because I've been on a bit of a plant kick as of late, I went with the Vigan (very clever working in the name of the establishment with the sandwich itself), and while I did have to ask to remove the Mozzarella cheese to make it a truly vegan entree, the sauteed portabella mushrooms, squash, red peppers and caramelized onions sandwiched between soft, rectangular focaccia with a side of onion rings was enough to leave me satisfied while wading in unknown dining waters. They also featured a pretty impressive 5-spice edamame appetizer, but their guacamole left a little to be desired.

He went off to get someone, and I watched her come out and start down the row of tables, stopping at each one, refreshing drink orders, taking food orders, and finally she's at the table right next to ours...and...this is where it gets good...SHE TURNS AROUND AND LEAVES.  I mean, it's like she's trying to avoid us at this point.  I had to send the busboy back after her, and when she finally showed up- no apology, no acknowledgment...actually, she seemed annoyed to have to even come to our table.  We were all being so nice to her when she did finally come, I had to ask why we were kissing this woman's a$$- so she would deign to come back to our table and wait on us???

It was a completely different, and very disappointing, experience.\n\nFirst off, for lunch you get to see what the place looks like with the lights on, so to speak. What used to be a cool and high-design kind of atmosphere (and that still looks that way at night) is really rough and showing some wear during the day. Dirty floors under our booth at 11:15 AM, the booths themselves looking a bit shabby, etc. We forgave them when what looked like a couple of great sandwiches showed up. Certainly not an inexpensive place to eat, though -- my roast beef was a $14.00 item all to itself. The food was \"Ok to Good.\"\n\nOur biggest disappointment, and the bulk of the reason for the low rating I'm giving this establishment, is the service. Wow, was it bad. This woman could care less about us, and left us sitting there for 20+ minutes while we were trying to pay our bill and get out of there. Later, I found that her \"who gives a s***\" attitude was because she was locked in for an 18% tip on the prepaid coupon I brought in (we had a \"Deal Chicken\"). I think it's really a poor choice for a restaurant to trust its waitstaff to the degree where they write a gratuity into the promotion . . . This woman had no concerns, because she was up for a nice tip no matter what we thought of her caring, concerned attitude (sarcasm intended). \n\nWe might try the Vig again, but I'll certainly avoid lunch and stick with a cocktail or a happy hour appetizer.

Let me just start by saying that I am not all that difficult to please, although my bf may disagree.  But seriously, I waitressed and cocktailed my way through college, both in bars and fine dining restaurants which makes me almost TOO forgiving when it comes to poor service since I know how many things can go wrong that aren't particularly the wait staff's fault.  This was not the case here.    \n\nWe arrived on a Monday evening to meet some friends for dinner and drinks.  We chose the spot expressly for the fact that both my friend and I had purchased Care Cards that benefit charity while giving you a 20% discount at participating retailers during Oct 14 - 23.  The Vig claimed to be one of these businesses.  Our party turned into about 7, and I had been seated for 15 minutes before our server came over to ask if I was thirsty.  I ordered a bottle of beer.  I see her next about 10 min later when she is delivering food to the table, although my beer is no where in sight.  She asks my companion if they want another, I politely let her know that I still had not received my first.  ANOTHER 10 minutes goes by, and my beer is finally delivered to the table.  In the meantime, my food had arrived.  They changed the menu and took my beloved seared sea scallops off and replaced them with Pad Thai (WTF?! there is no shortage of Thai offerings in the neighborhood) but they did add a few more healthy salads which is nice so I ordered a deconstructed fish taco salad.  This was the standout of the evening, and the reason for the 2nd star.  It is one of the best salads (healthy) I have had in recent memory.  Huge piece of perfectly grilled fish, crunchy salad with cilantro, salsa, guac, and black beans and cute little hot corn tortillas on the side.  \n\nAs the evening winds down, we ask for the check.  My friend had presented her Care Card when she first arrived with her husband, yet when the waitress brought the bill, there was no discount taken off.  Fine.  We see her about 5 min later and remind her.  10 min later she comes back with a revised bill with a whole $4.20 taken off.  Our check was $200.  I was no math major, but come now. After another 5 minute wait, I asked her why only $4 was taken off, she informed me bc only what the Care Card holder ordered had been discounted.  This was also bullsh!t because my friend ordered more indeed.  I asked to speak to the manager, and informed her that I also had a card.  Nowhere on the exclusions did it say: will only discount on the items the card holder orders (the nerve!).  We are all one party, with one check - and if you are participating in a charity benefit- effing do so!  They are providing you with free advertising and 7 customers you would not have had otherwise on a Monday night!  I have to use the restroom, so my friend says she will speak to the manager.  I walk back to the table to see a brown haired dude (the manager) rolling his eyes as he walks away assuring my friend he will \"take some more off\".  We wait another 10 minutes.  I wish I was joking.  She comes back and presents the bill with $15 taken off the total.  I have never experienced such poor service and attitudes.  Sadly, this was not the first time this has happened in the year that I have lived down the street and probably frequented this place 2-3 times a week at my peak infatuation with the Vig.  But just like most relationships, what starts out all champagne and roses eventually turns into complacency and laziness which is why I am dumping the Vig.  It's not me, it's you.

Then she proceeded to seat us at a table that was too small to accomodate 7 people.  We actually had to squeeze 2 people at the head of the table, which was very uncomfortable.  Seeing as how the restaurant was half empty, I think she could have been more accomodating.

The live band on the patio mid day Sunday was a nice touch, and something not seen most places. \nThe host suggested our large group take the corner of the bar as she was about to seat the girls sitting there. That also was a nice touch.

Our waitress, as well as all of the other waitresses, was incredibly nice, and strikingly attractive.  The price was reasonable; not terribly cheap and appropriately moderate.\n\nThe Music was up to date, as far as hipster and electronic rock is concerned in America.

I tried to find the DJ, to ask the name of a song, however they were no where to be found.\n\nThere was only one problem that would occasionally happen anywhere as great as The Vig.

When asked to move, after I returned, gangster-el-numero-uno refused, so that I could not return to my seat.

The fire and heaters were a pleasant touch, given the chilly evenings in Scottsdale during our early Spring weeks, some well deserved warmth. \n\nOverall, I would recommend The Vig to those that care about the type of evening place they go to, to meet friends and enjoy a well put together drink or a well poured scotch, rum or, brandy.

They have  heaters and an outdoor fireplace so its great regardless of the weather and your body temperature. If you are more into watching NFL Sunday  and staying away from nature, the indoors is small but fully equipped with flat screens showing the major games and scores. \n\nAlthough I only visited the Vig for brunch, I was pretty happy with their overall menu, food quality and service. The $5 Mimosa/Bloody Mary brunch special is pretty decent but some of their more signature, full-priced cocktails (like the van goh vodka with coffee and milk) definitely needs to kick it up a couple notches and stop skimping on the good ingredients (read:booze). At a table of 3, we ordered the hangover helper, shepherds pie and the tofu scramble- 3 very unique menu breakfast/brunch menu items that I was excited to try.\n\nThe tofu scramble (pictured) comes in a burrito but to be honest, the best way to eat it is sans tortilla bread and topped with 2 sunny-side up eggs. The mixture of grilled firm tofu, sun-dried tomatoes, chilies and assorted veggies is surprisingly spicy and full of flavor. However, since it doesn't come with any cheese or sauce, the yolk from the eggs on top boost up the dish by a factor of 10 and make it an amazing hearty (yet healthy) meal. Too bad the eggs don't come with the dish (gotta ask for it extra). \n\nIf the whole veggie/vegan/hippie roll ain't your thing, then the shepherds pie is probably the manliest breakfast you can get there. Giant piece of juicy steak and eggs sitting on a giant bed of potatoes, cheese, beans, corns and pretty much every ingredient in the kitchen. Its served on a giant skillet and will truly make you feel like a caveman eating for the next year. Props if you can finish eat, its a LOT of food. If that STILL seems too healthy for you, the hangover helper is another skillet drowning in baked tortilla, sauce and about 20lbs of melted cheese into one gooey dish. It tastes exactly like what you crave at 4am after doing too many jager-bombs in Old town. It comes with eggs, but instead it should comes with an additional 20lbs of hot sauce to accompany the cheese.\n\nEverything else really doesn't matter-  I mean, the service is decent, the crowd is good and the atmosphere is nice.

It was around 7pm but we didn't have to wait for a booth at all which made me happy! Our waitress came out and was a bit quiet and somber, maybe she wasn't happy about working that night I don't know. I liked the inside of the place, I'm not sure if they usually keep it that dark there or if it was just for the occasion, I didn't mind at all but I know some people like normal lighting at least to read their menu. They had a bunch of balloons hanging everywhere which I thought was cute.\n\nWe started with the chicken nacho appetizer to share and it wasn't my favorite. The chicken wasn't bite size, more like two inch shredded strips and some ends were very tough. The tortilla chips were super salty and thin so the ones under any toppings got soggy fast. The flavor of the whole thing was nice overall but needs some work in the details.\n\nI ordered the turkey sandwich with sweet potato fries and I was just a tiny bit sad I couldn't get a side of the mac and cheese for an upcharge! My boyfriend got the carne asada dish that also sounded tasty.\n\nThroughout the night we had maybe three or four men and women come to the table bringing food, drinks, refills, etc. Our actual waitress I think came three times total. I don't like this style of dining especially when the waiter or waitress doesn't even try to make an effort of being friendly or happy to serve you. Some of the gentleman bringing refills were smiling at us more than she was, and they weren't even getting tipped. This is where they lost a star from me. \n\nBut, it would have been 5 stars because the food was awesome. My sandwich was probably the best I've ever had. The pretzel roll was soft and slightly chewy, the cranberry chutney bursting with flavor, and the coleslaw was tangy and really brought the whole thing together. The turkey was good but hard to mess up as long as it's not taken out of a plastic grocery package. I don't remember what type of cheese was used but it was also great. I had to take half of it home and even cold the next day as leftovers it was still delicious. \n\nThe sweet potato fries were pretty good as well, hard to care about with such a great sandwich. I tried my boyfriend's carne asada dish and I liked it, there was too much tomato in my opinion and it gave it a steak and spaghetti type of flavor.\n\nAfter dinner we ventured outside to take a peak at the patio.

On my first visit I had the Vigazz Burger which I raved about to many as one of the best burgers I had ever had. cooked perfectly and the accompaniments set it off as a standout. \nLastnight, not so much. It started with a good time at the bar while we waited for a table outside. We expected to wait a bit as the weather was so beautiful. However after 40 minutes and no update we decided we would take inside or out. I might add the only hostess in the building was not being assisted in any way with info. We saw her have to leave the front door to go looking for open tables many times leaving ungreeted guests. She was very nice and professional so I can't hold The Vig's staffing decisions during, \" In Season\" against her.\nOnce we were seated It was very windy due to the dampeners on the vents being wide open and pointing straight down on the table. We were promptly and courteously moved to another table by the hostess. Keep in mind that a simple adjustment after closing will keep further guests from complaining. It wasn't the AC as much as the velocity. \nThis is where it goes down hill. Our server was overwhelmed, maybe another example of poor staffing. We ordered an appetizer as soon as we sat as we already had drinks. The smoked Salmon was great but you wouldn't know that because we were never checked on until it was cleared away. Also this means our dinner order was not taken until well after we had finished apps. Our fairly early dinner is now going on two hours without even ordering dinner yet. We both ordered and a temp was asked for on the burger. I ordered medium, needless to say it was well done and without the grilled onions and gruyere cheese would have been tasteless. I also asked for no bacon which I had to remove. Our server never came back to ask if we wanted another drink during our meal and when she did her check about how the food was we hadn't even started. I rarely review and only in an instance where something is truly standout in direct contradiction to it's reputation or my own past personal experience would I write a negative one. Our server, \"Glow\" indicated on check was inattentive and lacked service skills even taking into consideration the lack of staffing. Knowing when to ask for help is being a professional. In addition I'd like to add that no matter what a company's policy is on hair I think it's gross to wear your long flowing hair down while waiting tables. It may not be a county health policy as many like to state but it is an industry known practice to keep your hair tied up in some fashion.  \nWe will hope for a better experience next time because we do love the Vig and the Patio.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Love the late night deals and specials.

Decided on 3 stars because they ultimately did the right thing.  However, we won't be back because we have a bigger issue with the value Nori offers.  \n\nMy husband ordered Nabeyaki Udon(assorted seafood and vegetables/$15).  I had the Tempura Udon (shrimp and vegetable tempura/$14).   We also had a caterpillar roll which was okay, nothing special.  \n\nOur soups arrived in identical bowls with a tempura shrimp visible on top of each.  To their credit, they were piping hot. As we dove into our meals, the discrepancy between the two became surprisingly apparent.  My tempura udon had the one shrimp on top and that was it!  There was a bunch of chopped peppers, onion and zucchini, but no vegetable tempura.  On the other hand, my husband was also fishing out mussels, clams, a scallop and calamari.  Assuming there had to have been a mistake made in the kitchen or the price difference between the dishes must be greater than we thought, we asked the waitress.  She answered it was $1.  To be sure, I asked if the tempura should have come with only ONE piece of shrimp and she confirmed it.  However, there was a discussion about the vegetable tempura that should have also been on top.  I said I hadn't seen it and was even surer that I didn't eat it.  In fact, the waitress said, \"Now that you mention it, I don't recall seeing it either when we brought the dishes to the table.\"  My husband hadn't seen it either.  Discussions went back and forth between the waitress, manager and kitchen.  \n\nHere's where it gets a little weird.  The manager came by and asked if I was sure it wasn't in the dish.  He said they have a julienne of vegetables that is fried in the tempura in a kind of ball and placed on top of the soup with the shrimp.  \"Was I sure it wasn't there and it disintegrated into the soup, because the kitchen said it was there?\"  Huh?  First of all, why would you julienne vegetables for tempura and if it can meld into the dish to the point that the customer can no longer discern what it is, you should rethink the dish.  Vegetable tempura aside, we told him how dismayed we were that for $1, the nabeyaki came with twice the ingredients.  His answer, \"Yes, I know.  The problem is that we couldn't get away with charging $20 for the nabeyaki.\"  News flash, the problem is not current price of that dish.  Both dishes seemed over price.  Prices of tempura udon at other area restaurants:  SushiKo on Shea ... $8.95 (2 shrimp with a good portion of vegetable tempura) and $9.95 nabeyaki.  Sakana ... $8.99.  Toyama .... They don't have udon, but their mixed tempura appetizer with 2 pieces of shrimp and 4 vegetables is $7.95.  I could go on, but you get the point.  The manager did take the tempura udon off the bill for the \"missing vegetables\" and our server was great, but we just see no way to justify the cost to make future visits.

For starters, the new space is much larger than the old and the d\u00e9cor is appealing, casual and modern.  We were hungry and consumed a lot of bread while waiting between starter and entrees.  Each of us tried something different.  We had seafood and poultry.  The dishes left so little an impression that I don't recall what the specific entrees were.  However, I do remember the time between meals felt as if we were dining in Europe and not in a good way.  The food and service were mediocre and the new d\u00e9cor could not make up for that.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I rarely give 5 stars, as I believe it is very difficult to obtain a perfect score through food, beverage, service, ambiance, etc. Christopher's new venture is perfectly Christopher, 5 stars.\n\nFirst off a little background, Christopher is a native. That's right; he's a graduate of Central High School. He studied in France where he honed his craft and to this day draws his technique from. He has owned now three ventures in Phoenix, first his fine dining and bistro location on the northwest corner of 24st and Camelback (later became Eddie's by Eddie Matney, former hair dresser turned chef at Cous-Cous then Eddie's Grill) then after closing he moved to the restaurant row in The Biltmore Fashion Park, 2rd level to open Christopher's Fermier Brasserie & Paola's Wine Bar. Which in reading many reviews here on Yelp was unfortunately misunderstood. It makes me wonder if people understand what French is, it's not their fault though, there aren't many French restaurants in town, most have be closed, including Mary Elaine's at the Phoenician  and John Claude's Petite Cafe. There are a few that still survive Sophie's and Vincent's, but in this town of chains few people venture for French. Now with Christopher's Restaurant/Crush Lounge he has passed on the wine bar and opened a lounge instead. Christopher does enjoy lounges as he is a regular at Merc Bar, but then so is his smoked salmon which is offered on the Merc Bar menu. So a lounge makes sense, I'm a believer in a chef should open what they are passionate about. \n\nThe new location has a different feel from his previous; his last venture echoed a French Countryside feel, as did the food. I think that was why many didn't understand it; yes it was French, but ALL FRENCH IS NOT FINE DINNING. I wish more understood that concept, but this is primarily a beer drinking state, not wine or rather more Mc D's not Mary E's! Hence there's a difference between filling your stomach and filling your soul and leaving a restaurant inspired with the feeling that life is wonderful. Christopher's is the latter. \n\nThe design is contemporary with long lines of brushed stainless, white linen and exposed wooden beams. Kudos to whoever designed it, great job! The tables are dressed with white linen, elegant silver and polished stemware. You can't help but feel that it's 'time to dine' when seated. The walls in the main dining room have many vases of fresh flowers that seem to be replaced whenever necessary, nice touch.  \n\nThe food at Christopher's is exactly what you'd expect, French, without the super-high-end prices. He's still one of the only chefs in town serving Foie Grass and Duck Confite, both wonderful and worth the trip if a glass of juice (wine) is added! I've been there now on 4 occasions and everything is fantastic, flavorful and prepared professionally. Christopher offers daily specials and I recommend them including; Veal Chop on Wednesdays, Roasted Duck on Thursday, Lamb Shank on Friday and Rabbit on Saturday. But don't stop at your entree, get the cheese course for dessert or for something sweet, the Chocolate Tower is one of the best desserts in town, hands down, no question.  \n\nService is another point were Christopher sets himself apart. It doesn't get any better than this. Again it's NOT fine dining, so you can't compare it to fine dining restaurants (but then again there's only one left in the valley - Different Point Of View).  The servers know the food; they can describe anything on the menu and recite the specials as if their job depends on it (if you know Christopher it probably is).  Food is coursed correctly with a few minutes in between, as well as wine service is as professional as it gets. The bread service is as always, French breads with a super rich, euro butter, perfect for lapping up to sauce or vinaigrette remains on your plate.\n\nNeedless to say, Christopher does it right, in my opinion, or is it just my opinion? Many of the valley's most celebrated chefs eat at Christopher's, he's know in many circles as the \"chef's chef\". But don't take my word for it, ask the chef at your favorite restaurant, who their favorite chefs are in town, and favorite restaurants, most likely Christopher will make the list!\n\nHere's the web address:  http://www.christophersaz.com/\n\nThe website is limited; menu, wine list, press release and pictures of the restaurant...", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 7, "cool": 5}}, {"text": "I love the design.

All the fries selections (truffled, curried with duck confit, yam) are excellent although way too large for a sane person to finish - plan to share. The truffle infused fillet is nice (though it cannot touch the lamb) and the hanger steak excellent. I've enjoyed the scallops and several fishes of the day, but the meats are the highlight. Crusty French style bread and unsalted butter accompany the meals. Vegetables are available ala carte and those I've tried have been good but generally pale compared to the meats \n\nLight food is not the focus here - the salads are generally good (I particularly like the smoked salmon) but not enough for a real meal if you are hungry, and I consider them bordering on the expensive side but not too much so. Most other selections are rich with butter, cream, and/or animal fats. Yum. \n\nThe wine by the glass selection is one of the best I've seen in Phoenix, with a nice variety of domestic, French, Italian and a few others (but who cares about those anyway). Best is during the 4-6 weekdays happy hour, wines by the glass are 1/2 off, making many of them a smoking deal.

My favorite spot is at the kitchen bar, watching the heart of the kitchen activity. During slow times the staff has given us little tidbits of \"test\" items to taste, and Chef Christopher always says hello. The one down side of the furnishings is the ergonomics (or lack thereof ) of the kitchen bar chairs. Did the manufacturer ever test them with real people?? The seats are too deep to lean comfortably against the back of the chair. Those with perfect posture may be fine perched on the edge of the chair all night, but we like to linger over dinner and must either sit up without leaning on the chair back all night or slouch back and feel frumpy while gaining only a modicum of comfort. \n\nService isn't nearly as consistent as the food. Most of the time we've not been offered a taste of the wine before a full glass was plopped in front of us, sometimes service is so slow that we've trouble getting our orders in before happy hour expired (despite arriving 30 minutes before it was over), the red wine has several times come quite chilled, and the checks have come without the happy hour discount.

A long thin line of tables around the open kitchen.  Awkward layout.  Minus a quarter star.    Service good.  Food good.   But that layout again... sitting there feeling like I'm under surveillance by the staff at all times, ugh.   And it's waaaay too cold in there - oh they must have to keep it colder so that when that big door opens and all the A/C goes outside it can recover quickly, oh yeah.    So then I need to go to the restroom after all that iced tea..... uh.... very fancy uni-stalls - can't blame them for the need to have these superlarge stalls I guess because it's required by the ADA.... but then how do they get away with the absurdly ridiculous unisex, out-in-public \"SINK\" - if it can be called a sink.   So you're done with your business and you are now out among the public to wash your hands and adjust your makeup - ladies, do we want to do that IN PUBLIC?   Methinks not either.  But at this trendy-gone-bad restaurant restroom, the ladies on one side of a big mirror wash their hands over some pebbles with an automatically-activated sprinkler system that serves up enough water for a lineup of maybe 6 or 8 people at a time.  Again, people - we live in the middle of a DESERT.   Water is precious.   And yet here at Christopher's it is triggered to run freely to wash my hands (again, IN PUBLIC) longer than I need and over about a 6 foot wide area.  I just measured my hands and they are only 8 inches wide.\n\nPeople can disagree about the food - I find it delicious.  I particularly love the grilled salmon and I've had wonderful fresh soups at Christopher's.   At the old location I had many joyous meals and celebrations.

My first impressions of the waiter was that he was both friendly and attentive, that would be the saving grace(if any) of this experience.  While there were many open booths and tables, we were seated in between two older couples in the back of the restaurant. It was so quiet, I asked our waiter if we were allowed to talk.  We ordered the bottled water service and received our menus.  Upon receipt of the menu, my eyes lit up.  There were so many dynamic choices and eye catching listings, that I was having trouble deciding upon both my appetizer and entree.\n\nI ordered a dirty grey goose martini with extra olives and my companion a glass of Cabernet.  My martini was not dirty at all, which made it somewhat enjoyable as it was just chilled vodka,  but the blue cheese olives were abundant and phenomenal.   Our first course arrived and we had decided to share the sweetbreads and the vegetable risotto.  I was a few bites in when it dawned on me that I was about to have an \"Avalon\" moment.  An exhilarating menu with food that falls infallibly short.  The sweetbreads were covered in some charred type substance neither of us could make out. The sweetbreads were tough and had absolutely no seasoning. The lack of seasoning would become a trend of the entire evening.  The vegetable risotto is not listed or advertised correctly.  It is a small layer of sauce, a few kernels of arborio rice and a pile of vegetables.  I like vegetables as well, but when I am ordering risotto, I would actually like the starch as well.  The risotto needed more than a few pinches of salt and the sweetbreads were inedible.  \n\nI thought at this point, that the entrees we had ordered would save the day.  I would be wrong.  My companion ordered the house specialty, the squab.  In my twenty five years of dining, I have never been so embarrassed for a kitchen, as i was for this kitchen, when the food was tasted.  The squab was supposed to be a two legs, confit style, and two breasts that were roasted.  Oh my.  How this dish was able to leave the kitchen I will never quite understand.  It was entirely undercooked, gamey, unseasoned, uncuttable and overall ghastly, just ghastly.  My scallops looked appealing, but for a thirty-two dollar price tag, I was hoping for a bit more than four scallops and a small stack of greens.  Nevertheless, i forged ahead and gave it a try.  The scallops were undercooked, underseasoned(see a trend here?), and utterly tasteless.  \n\nMy dining partner and I stared at each other for a few moments before we started laughing. One of the best parts about having a really bad meal is that you get to joke about it for a while and the bad meal repays itself in comedy.  That would not be the case here.  When the bill was brought to me and I opened to review, my mouth hit the floor.  Fifteen dollars for that crappy martini? Fourteen dollars in water? We figured that one out, that the waiter brought us a new bottle at the end of the meal, without us asking us and the bottle remained 95% full, but we were charged an additional seven dollars for it.  The bill of $154 dollars, was an outrage to say the least. The squab was inedible, the scallops a disaster, and the appetizers a joke.\n\nSorry for bursting the bubble for people on this one, but my recommendation is to PASS.", "review_stars": 1, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 4, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "OK yelpers here goes.....

This was slow eating at its finest as I built each component onto the end of my fork. \n\nA salad composed with delightfully salty Duck Confit ($16) mixed greens, Humboldt Fog cheese and Cognac infused cherries was a triumph. But the Butter Poached Lobster ($18) with fresh greens, pine nuts and roasted fennel vinaigrette was better and now my new favorite. \n\nHow about a few suggestions for your main course? Definitely the smoked truffle infused Filet Mignon ($36), tender, earthy and ambrosial. We also enjoyed the 12 oz. New York Steak ($34), cast iron seared and pepper-crusted. Heightened with cracked pepper, the beef flavor was piquant and juicy.\n\nConsider a few sides too, such as the Mac n'Cheese Au Gratin ($7) with velvety cream sauce spiked with ham or the additively smooth Gruy\u00e8re Pommes Pur\u00e9e ($7).

The steak was good, a tad underseasoned though. The reduction was way over reduced and tasted like gravy. it also had the \"sauce skin\" on top by the time it came out, not very appealing.  Luckily I like gravy, but not what I'd expect from a fine dining restaurant. I'd order the dish again, just maybe with a different sauce.  \n\nI decided to order teh curried duck frites.

I arrived w/ high expectations, of both the ambience and the food, and I wasn't disappointed... much.  The service was a bit spotty at times- we were immediately greeted when we entered and were seated quickly, but the wait that came after water delivery was a bit long at a time when there were no other guests seated around us.  (Perhaps there were other guests seated elsewhere, but they weren't seated at the lounge, at the food bar, nor outside... Indeed, it seemed like were were the only ones in the room, besides the cooks at the open kitchen area, the servers, and the bartenders.)  Bread was delivered, but we were each given only one one-inch slice of a baguette.  How strange, especially when the butter cup held enough butter to spread over a whole loaf!  Whatever...  Two of the three dinner specials were relayed to us, w/ the promise of coming back to tell me about the scallop dish, but when our server finally came back ten or so minutes later, he asked if we were ready to order, so I had to remind him about the scallop entree... What was in it, and how was it prepared, and how much?  Hmmm, maybe he was ready to go home...\n\nCame in w/ Mom, so we had to try the calamari.  I also chose the Duck confit, goat cheese, and fig pizza.  For dessert, we had the profiteroles.  I really liked the calamari's coating-- lightly battered and fried golden-brown.  My fave pieces of the squid are also my Mom's fave, the tentacles, so these were soon finished.  At least half of the remaining pieces, the sliced bodies, were undercooked-- poor value for the $12 menu price tag (and I was charged $13 on the ticket).  The pizza* was TERRIFIC!  Loved the semolina thin crust, and the duck confit gave the entree a great smoky flavor-- I thought perhaps there were lardons included in this dish too, but all the smokiness came from the duck.  Mmmm.... The goat cheese was very creamy, and there were lovely chopped figs all over the place-- I'd order this pizza again in a heartbeat!  The profiteroles were fantastic, as well.  Three sliced choux pastry rounds, filled w/ dark chocolate sorbet, vanilla, and chocolate ice cream, sat on a pretty display made of chocolate ganache and creme anglaise, whole blackberries and blueberries, and a sliced strawberry.  More ganache was poured over the top of one profiterole upon presentation.  I asked if I could have more ganache, and our server quickly obliged-- thank you!!  We loved the crisped flakiness of the pastry (so perfect!), and out of the three flavors, we liked the fudgy dark chocolate sorbet the most.  I tell you, if I could've licked the plate clean, I would have.  :)  Excellent dessert-- I totally recommend!\n\n(*Pizza reheats well!

My wife and i went to Christophers 2 nights ago for her birthday. I need to say I own a restaurant and bar in the phoenix area.  mI am a chef but i sincerely rate restaurants on their food, service and atmosphere fairly and most importantly from both my wife and my personal experience. \nFirst the atmosphere. I have traveled throughout the USA and Europe. Dined in every conceivable type of restaurant.  All i can say about the atmosphere in Christophers is BLAH ! Plain Jane ! needs improvement.\nNext the food: In the price range of Christophers......THEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES. I frequently spend 40-75 dollars per plate a la carte style for dinner. NEVER complain about price for quality. So what is my complaint. The quality of the food was FAR below their menu price point. Wife had Lobster Bisque as an appetizer...should have been called flavored cream soup. I had the tempura calamari.....ZERO FLAVOR ! Ny Strip for main entree...anyone have  a saw ? Really pathetic !\nWifes obster pot Pie was decent with the exception of the THICK cakey encrusted lobster. Tough flavorless and just ruined the dish. \nMacaroni and Cheese with ham....have to say was pretty good on the top but VERY runny and milky underneath. Truffled Frites.......NOT BAD ! Or should i say nicely cooked and flavor was good......seasoned well and presented well.\nNOW Dessert....Chocolate Tower.......UMM...TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT !

I have been to Christopher's a handful of times and each time there has been something that has made me question the snotty behavior of our servers. Just because my friends and I are on the younger side of the Christopher's crowd (read: under 50) and frequent the place for happy hour, does not mean we are trash or deserve to be treated as such. The following is a sampling of true stories that I have encountered. \n\nScenario 1: 2 of our party of 4 waited at the kitchen bar for 10 minutes after being seated without being acknowledged. No \"I'll be right with you\" or any greeting at all. The waiter saunters over and asks if they would like something to drink. How are they supposed to know what they want to drink? They had to ask him for a wine menu and for that matter a dinner menu as well. 10 minutes of sitting, wondering who their server is, wondering when they would get a menu.... too much wondering. \n\nScenario 2: The kitchen bar was full during happy hour so they reluctantly obliged to letting us sit at a high top right by the kitchen bar for happy hour since happy hour is only supposed to be at the kitchen bar and the Crush lounge area. We order our first round of wines and the waiter knocks over a glass of red wine all over one of the girls in our group. LUCKILY she was wearing a dark top anyways but the waiter didn't even apologize. I quote, \"Obviously I didn't mean for that to happen\". That was it. He didn't even help clean it up, he had the busser come over to help her pat down. I understand accidents happen, but apologize for it. Just don't be rude about it. If he would have apologized we would all have a better perception of the place but even beyond that incident, he was short and rude with us the entire time we were there. \n\nScenario 3: This scenario is hard to explain via Yelp review, so please forgive me if it seems blunt/rude/etc. I will be using terms like Asian and White a lot but none of it is meant to be offensive. My friend and I, and another table of Asians, were the only non-white tables at the restaurant. I'm not one to judge based on race, but it just so happened to be something I noticed. I overheard a white table ask the server how the ahi tuna was. The server then told the man asking 'Oh that Chinese guy over there ate it and finished his plate'. .... Ummmm what is that supposed to mean? I don't understand the significance of an Asian guy eating the tuna and how that is supposed to make it sound good or make it sound desirable for the other patron of the restaurant. He could have just said 'that guy over there' if he was trying to say other people have ordered it and enjoyed it. His ethnicity had nothing to do with it. \n\nSo why do I keep going back you might wonder? Well. Their happy hour is amazing. The food and drink specials mean that we go there expecting rude service, we typically get rude service, but we are able to have a nice dinner, a couple glasses of wine, all for about $20 a person. I will probably go back. I love the wines, the fries, the pizzas, the cheeseburger, and the filet of salmon salad (basically the whole hh menu).

This time it was served with a pan sauce, polenta and yellow squash. My friend who was also getting the rabbit ordered first. She has a bunch of dietary restrictions, so she wanted her rabbit without sauce, and with steamed vegetables. When it came time for me to order, the server did not come around to where I was, which I found odd - if not rude. I said \"can you come around, please?\" and he gave me The Chin, as if to say, just go ahead with your order. So I had to talk across my dinner partner. \n\nI ordered the rabbit \"as it comes, with the sauce\", but didn't want the polenta and yellow squash. I asked if I could have a salad instead. The waiter said yes, and I asked if it came dressed with a vinaigrette, which he confirmed. \n\nDinner arrived. And I did not get what I ordered. I had naked rabbit on the plate -  no sauce. That was quickly solved, but still. And then the salad I ordered were greens piled on a plate with a side saucier of vinegar and oil. I had not asked for the dressing on the side, in fact, I would have preferred the salad be dressed. So I found myself whisking the vinegar and oil furiously with a fork to get it to emulsify enough so I could put some on my greens. This was not a great dining experience. \n\nSeveral nights later, I went again and ordered the seafood assortment: salmon, scollop, mussels, and calamari over risotto and some kind of sauce. \n\nGranted, I wanted it a bit different from how it was presented, but I should be able to get what I want. \n\nSo my dining partner ordered first (same one as above) no sauce, no this, no that. Then I ordered - \"seafood as featured, except the risotto on the side\". \n\nHere comes my seafood - naked on the plate. No sauce. Clearly, this waiter also did not listen. Sauce was produced on the side, but it's not what I wanted. Plus, about half the dish consisted of calamari that were battered and fried. Nowhere on the menu board did it say 'fried calamari'. The waiter did not mention it. I cannot eat a pile of fried food if I don't want to have huge stomach upset. So I couldn't eat half of my (unsauced) dinner.

We also ordered a potato au gratin as well for the side dish.  The lamb shank was the best main course.  Lamb shanks can be cooked with a light meat taste or heavier like in this case.  The gamey taste of the shank complemented well with the mushroom risotto sauce.  The meat came off the bones just beautifully. Be sure to complement the dish with a more medium to full-bodied wine.   The medium rare filet mignon was disappointing.   It was overcooked in parts of the filet and the texture was off.   Sometimes I felt like I was gnawing at the meat.  The peppercorn sauce just didn't fit well with the dish.  It would've been better if there wasn't any sauce at all.  I've just had better filets before.  The potato au gratin came out beautifully.  Parmesan cheese and cream mix made the light and moist.  Adding cream really made the difference and I could even eat it after it was cooled down.  \n\nNow on to the dessert.  We choose their signature cheesecake.  This isn't what you would normally expect from a cheesecake.  It was garnished with a champagne honey sauce, light layer of almonds, fresh strawberries, and a decorative sugar piece.  The cheesecake itself was awesome.   However I couldn't stand the sweet champagne honey sauce.  Eating that sauce with the cheesecake felt like eating sugar with a cheesecake texture.\n\nOverall opinion, flashy, but not so much substance.  Especially for the price we paid.  Most of the dishes were ok, but the complementary elements like the sauces made the dishes worse.   The main thing I would like to see is that the chef would make sure that every element of the dish will work well together.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I've been to Christopher's twice for lunch and have never been disappointed.

Bathed in light from the outside at first and then dissipating to a romantic glow as the sun set both the lounge and the dining room at Christopher's have a modern but refined feel with white tablecloths, fine service ware, and comfortable seating abound while the walls are minimally adorned with single flowers, wooden art, and mirrors.\n\nThe Service:  Pleasant, descriptive, whimsical, and efficient James did a great job of working with my friend's allergies while additionally being sure water was always filled and bread was replenished as necessary - an admirable feat as he was probably the only captain on our half of the dining room thus quarterbacking at least four back servers working perhaps twenty tables without ever missing a beat.\n\nThe Food: Wood Oven Pizza with Foie Gras, Andouillette, Boudin Noir & Goat Cheese:  An 8-slice oblong pie clearly focused on decadence I must say that I was hesitant to order pizza in a French restaurant but this $26 dish worked astonishingly well.  Beginning first with the lightly charred crust - sturdy and smoky with a great chew - and moving next to rich and lightly brined chevre I was immediately impressed by the quality of the base and moving on to the trio of offal things only got better as the creamy melting liver, briny blood sausage, and onion-laced crumbly pork all melded into a complex flavor that was at once mineral and pungent but also slightly sweet thus preventing it from being overly rich.\n\nTerrine of Mousse of Foie Gras served w/ Brioche:  My first course of the prix fixe was a nearly 2 ounce slice of creamy foie gras topped with Hawaiian black sat served with golden brioche, greens lightly dressed in vinaigrette, and three dots of reduced Balsamic.  A very traditional preparation, particularly next to the pizza, this was my third foie gras course of the day and although the least 'unique,' a very smooth and well sourced product served in surprising portion for a $40 prix-fixe.\n\nPied du Cochon with Brussels Sprouts, Mustard Seed, and Smoked Bacon:  For our main courses Aileen opted for the Steak Frites while her sister chose the Dover Sole Meuniere and while I didn't taste the former but quite liked the simplicity of the later I was more than happy with my choice of two flaky pastry shells stuffed full of crispy trotters alongside caramelized sprouts and a sauce of smoked bacon and fresh mustard seeds.  Intense and savory, well balanced with the pungency of the sprouts, and just a touch of earthy heat from the mustard this was another bistro style dish slightly reimagined that impressed even despite my overall distaste for mustard, an ingredient that here acted to enhance the salty pork rather than mute it as is sometimes the case.\n\nDaily Gnocchi with Onions, Belly Bacon, Taleggio, and Cream:  For $8 this was an absolute steal of a side dish as there were no less than fifteen tender dumplings swimming in a pool of bubbling cheese and cream tinged with bacon and onions.  Admittedly getting full at this point in the day, particularly as I'd eaten 3/4 of the pizza myself plus a few slices of bread I made sure I finished each dumpling, particularly those where the cheese had browned to form a bit of crunch, but I still regret sending a good portion of the creamy cheese mixture back to the kitchen rather than applying it to another slice of baguette.\n\nTarte Tatin with Vanilla Bean Gelato:  My prix fixe dessert, and another enormous portion, was this rustic apple tarte tatin with buttery caramelized apples juxtaposed against a crisp pastry shell alongside drizzles of cr\u00e8me anglaise, salty caramel, and a tuille cup filled with rich vanilla bean gelato.  Now three for three in the frozen confection department this was a lovely representation of \"French Apple Pie\" and while I still prefer America's take on the dish this was certainly a memorable dessert teaming with butter and not overwhelmingly sweet.\n\nChocolate Mousse Tower with Berries, Espresso Cr\u00e8me:  Having joked with James that it seemed odd not to serve the dish that Chef Gross prepared with Julia Child as part of her tribute menu he had to agree but for $10 extra it would have been foolish to pass on this lovely cylinder of white and dark chocolate stuffed with light chocolate mousse and berries as a supplemental dish.

It's basically in the parking garage of the Biltmore.  I guess the parking is much easier than it was across the street (it used to be in an office building, where you needed to park in an office garage and deal with validation), but having it just off the parking garage at the Biltmore was a poor decision.    What a horrible location to pick.  No views and a towering white parking garage looms overhead.   They should have considered this location better. Even a court yard view or the front parking lot view would have been better,.\n\nOnce inside the restaurant the ambiance was great and service was impeccable.  I ordered the filet and my SO ordered the fish of the day.  Both were spectacular. We first ordered the fois gras as an appetizer along with the duck salad and both were to die for.  After all was said and done (appetizers, dessert, side dishes and a bottle of wine) and with the discount of $50 we were out the door at ~$220.  \n\nHere's my problem.  Was it good?

I think Lons at the Hermosa Inn and Royal Palms were way, way better and more memorable dinners with views, ambiance and food.\n\nAnother thing that bothered me was the 18% gratuity automatically added to the bill.

There regular menu might be executed better, though I doubt I will be back to find out.  For those of you trying to select which restaurant to try for Restaurant week a word (or many) of caution.  \nI decided to go with the wine pairings, which were ok though nothing to write home about.  Let me start with the bread, as I have come to judge a restaurant on this initial offering.  While not offensive the baguette had a chewy almost stale exterior-nothing like the crust you would find in any boulangerie in France.  I do wish that American restaurants would serve homestyle bread or even focaccia, rather than a poorly executed artisanal bread.  I did appreciate that the butter was salted and at room temperature rather than ice cold.  Onto the appetizer: I opted to start with the ravioli with truffle essence and fine herbs.  The only redeeming element of this dish was the faint flavor of truffle.  The pasta itself was tough.  It actually reminded me of the refrigerated ravioli you can buy at Trader Joes.  The broth that it came in was ok, but nothing that you would want to soak up the extra with your bread.  The best part of my dinner was the 2nd offering-the scallop mousse.  It was seasoned well and had a texture that would remind you of a cross between a panna cotta and egg custard.  The flavor was fresh, though the few peas on top were a but starchy.  I ended the meal with the sole entree. The sole lacked even the tiniest bit of salt or pepper, as did the steamed cauliflower beneath.  The sauce swirled around the perimeter of the plate was quite tasty, however, each element of a dish must be seasoned properly for it to be enjoyable to eat.  Given that I had expected to gorge myself on delicious food, I had eaten a very small lunch.  After leaving over half of the tough pasta and an entire filet of sole, I left the restaurant still hungry and set back $70.

Nothing to distinguish it from the furniture shops and closed doors around it. Understated, nice.\n\nSo, what did I find inside? A hugely expansive bar that kept the dark, intimate atmosphere. A bar full of beautiful bartenders serving beautiful cocktails (old favourites as well as house specials), another room full of couches out the back, all candlelit, a DJ playing from a piano-converted-into-decks, and a lot of happy but not overly drunken people. \n\nThere was no problem finding a space on a Saturday night, we just bunched a few tables together for our larger party. There weren't many crowds at the bar, waiting time for cocktails was just the right length: long enough you know they're crafted with care, but made as promptly as possible.\n\nI won't keep waxing lyrical about the bar itself: all you need to know is it's beautiful, dark, intimate, sexy, plays the best music I've heard a bar play in a long while (why was no one dancing?

Joe A and Kerrin R went back and ordered 3 Red Fairies each. I have witnessed them try a few cocktails before, but normally only one before moving on to JD and cokes.

I watched him hand squeeze the orange juice, use a grapefruit liqueor of whom he knew the supplier, and it was quite lovely.

It was very popular perhaps because there wasn't much in the way of competition around.  It was, as far as nightclubs go, very loud.

Loud, obnoxious, rowdy, big group, who were not only inebriated from the previous ball game which they just crawled off a bus from, but continued to drink their heads off with regular spurts of raucous laughter.  It got even worse, as they then celebrated a birthday in the group.\n\nmoving onward...\n\nYou seriously have to gawk at the likes at what constantly walks in here.  \n\nJanuary....\n\nI mean, I was sitting outside on the beautiful patio next door at Ocean Prime, and my teenager couldn't help but roll his eyes in disgust at what the 50 year old ma'ams (or is it Madames?) and the get-ups (or lack of them).  Looked like freaky muppets with all that hair, googly eyes, big lips, plastic-y, and other extraordinary cartoonish characteristics.  \n\nTIme MARCH-es on\n\nSo, on yet another date night, I go to head to the sexy patio at Ocean Prime, but it was closed off due to wind.  SO I groaned and thought, ok, we'll ck out the next outdoor establishment, since it seemed pretty quiet - shock.  \n\nAfter sitting down, it didn't take long to realize that I felt unclean, got the creeps and thought how trashy this and the patrons in it were.  To top it off, I didn't see any wines by the glass. \n\n I'm otta here.  \n\nWe quickly made a dash to the swanky & very classy  indoor bar area of Ocean Prime.  Had an amazing glass of red wine.

The price tag may seem steep, but they serve the shaker alongside and you basically end up with 2 big martinis- can't complain about that! \n\nFood: Mini Martini Lamb Chops...yum yum yum. A perfectly sized portion of seared rack of lamb with what tastes like a homemade chimichurri. Other menu items include standard bar fare like shrimp cocktail, several flatbread pizzas, artichoke dip, and sandwiches, so on and so forth. Nothing groundbreaking, but nothing unpalateable.\n\nEntertainment: Live music followed by a DJ every night, and zero cover charge. Cover bands like The Instant Classics, The Chadwicks, and Rock Lobster are regularly on the lineup. You won't see any edgy new bands here, but it's a fun place to sing along and dance to cheesy tunes ranging from Michael Jackson to Lady Gaga. \n\nIn a nutshell?

However, if the movie is about a handicapped nun with one leg living in the Ukraine, the acting sure as hell better be great. \n\nI feel like my review of Blue Martini should be based on this same philosophy.

I love making new friends and chatting with strangers when I'm out and I have met so many great people at blue. Girls get catty with other girls b/c lets face it we're all in competition. The crowd is older and more mature. I am 27 and considered to be young but I have always disliked hanging out with people my own age so it works for me. \n\nThe music: almost always live, if not there is a DJ that knows how to mix and plays fun stuff.

If you are not familiar with the area, you probably will not even know it exists. City North looks like an abandoned parking structure/office space during the day and despite driving past the area for the past several years, this year was the first time I found out anything even exists in there and that's only because a friend of mine told me about it.\n\nTHE FOOD/DRINKS\n\nI tried a couple martinis, red bull vodka, scotch and vodka and did not come away thinking that an ingredient was missing or a water founds its way into the drink. The martinis come in a metal mixer in addition to your glass which is a nice touch, but carrying the drink from a bar to friend(s) becomes quite a fascinating adventure. The prices are on the high side, but I figure you are also paying for the waitresses looking good.\n\nLate at night when the hunger could no longer be quenched by drinks, my wife and I ordered some sort of a pizza thing that was reasonable priced and sized and was actually tasty. Kudos for having that, although the food menu to me seemed a bit on a skimpy side for things that would be easy to eat late at night and not necessarily sober.\n\nSETTING\n\nIf you have a narrow filed of view, the place looks like it can be a part of a nice strip of bars and clubs in a real city. Getting over the fact that 100 feet in any direction the development ends takes a few drinks.\n\nBy my approximate count, there are two bars, some individual tables inside as well as on the patio and of course the dance floor area which is relatively small. So you have quite a variety of places to be at. For SMOKERS out there, this is probably one of the most friendly places I've been to, as the patio where you can smoke is just about as comfortable as the interior, something to remember when it is 110 outside.\n\nSERVICE\n\nJoe and Ashley (mostly Ashley) took great care of our mostly ESL pack of drinkers, which must have been quite a challenge, as Ashley gets quite a bit of attention from male patrons due to the combination of the attire all the girls wear at this place and the particulars of her physique.\n\nObviously drunk/rowdy get lead out the door in a hurry and the drunkards that try to get their keys from valet get a time out before getting the car. \n\nTHE CROWD\n\nProbably the most important part of this place to most people that come here. The crowd is very varied in age from mid 20s to entirely-too-old-for-this-place. Noticeable number of lone wolves (like the old drunkard that tried hitting on my wife) and lone cougars (sometimes younger). It would appear that a lot of people come here to hit or be hit on. If you are not into that, bring bodyguards or skip a shower :)\n\nOTHER\n\nThere was a live cover band at the beginning of the night and while entertaining, the quality of their singing made it seem like karaoke night at first.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Had my birthday here with my closest friends.

I've been to Blue Martini once before for a karaoke night, but I had two huge meals there recently that allowed me to sample a ton of their signature martinis and dishes.\n\nBlue Martini is the anchor of CityNorth, a retail and living space that only completed the first phase of its development. Our server assured us the complex would soon be built up again, with more restaurants and shops to come besides the few (Kona Grill, Bebe, Ocean Prime, to name a few) it has now.\n\nNot surprisingly, Blue Martini's signature menu item is its martinis. The menu boasts more than 40 varieties and come in just about any flavor you might like.\n\nProbably my favorite martini I tried during the weekend was the Caramel Swirl, with Van Gogh Dutch Caramel Vodka, Irish Cream Liqueur and cream in a glass topped with caramel. It was sweet and didn't taste like alcohol, and if you love caramel, it's a no-brainer.\n\nThe Espresso Martini is almost as tasty, with Grey Goose Vodka, Borghetti Espresso Liqueur and Irish Cream in a chocolate-covered glass. It definitely has that coffee taste.\n\nA restaurant favorite is the Bellini, a peachy drink filled with Grey Goose Vodka, Peach Schnapps, peach puree, Chandon sparkling wine and a splash of orange juice. It was fruity and had a tropical vibe to it.\n\nI also tried the Tootsie Roll, which tasted like an orange Tootsie Roll pop, and The Perfect Pear, which tasted more sour than pear-like-our table wouldn't recommend that one.\n\nFood-wise, we sampled a little bit of everything on the menu. By far, my favorite dish on the tiny menu is the Margherita Flatbread, which had the perfect consistency because it had lots of cheese and wasn't too crispy. This is what I'd get every time if I went back for food.\n\nWe also tried the Roasted Red Pepper Hummus, which came with fried pita chips. I was not a fan of the pita because it was too thick and hard, and the hummus was just mediocre to me. I felt the exact same way about the Spinach and Artichoke dip, which also came with fried pita chips and wasn't spectacular.\n\nWe also tried the Baked Brie en Croute, a breid cheese puff over a strawberry cabernet sauce that came with crackers and grapes. It was a really delicious dish-I just wish there was more of it!\n\nMy friends loved the Sliced Beef Tenderloin.\n\nAnd we all gobbled up the White Chocolate Mousse cake dessert, which was rich and creamy and came with an Oreo cookie crust and white chocolate and whipped cream.\n\nWhile the food and drinks were great, I'd try to go during happy hour if you could, since cocktails are all half-off from 3-7 p.m. daily, and food is discounted. Most martinis cost around $12, and food generally ranges between $10-$20, so this is definitely the best time to go.

I don't go out much, as I have two small children and prefer spending time with them.  My sisters--in-law both decided to surprise me for my birthday, arranged to have my mother-in-law watch my kids, and took me out to Blue Martini.  It was a Wednesday night (Ladies' Night).

I tracked it the next day to downtown Phoenix at Washington and Central.  That rules out the phone being \"lost.\"  I have lost sleep over this, and for a bar that is supposedly sophisticated with high end service and clientele, I should not expect that my property will be stolen while I'm there.  Not only can the photos not be replaced, I definitely can't afford to get the phone replaced.

The crowd was everything from mid 20's to late 50's. \n\nMy friend and I easily got a spot by the bar which was nice. Although there was a lot of free seating inside and outside. Inside there are two bars, one underneath the platform of the live band/stage and another bar in the back where it's quieter and away from the dance floor as well. There's also a third bar outside, a huge one at that, with lots of seating at and around the bar. \n\nThe food was phenomenal, shared the Beef Tenderloin and Apple Tart ala Mode. My friend had some drinks which tasted great. But both the food and drinks are extremely pricey. To get in, the cover for ladies was $5, which I found funny since it's more of a restaurant anyway than a nightclub like Maya or Mint in old town haha. There's tons of police at the front which was comforting. \n\nThe bathrooms were stunning, granite and marble throughout and extremely clean!

Let's not get it twisted folks, we're not breaking gastronomic ground here.  What we are breaking are your misconceptions of what a restaurant can be whose parking lot is largely composed of Chevy and Dodge trucks, and whose front, snow-covered, lawn is full of snowmobiles.  Deal with it kids, this is that slice of Midwest Americana you've been looking for in any number of wayside eateries in rural America.  Fish fry anyone?\n\nTo begin, let me explain that one of the many draws for the Beach House's patrons is the fact that it is still legal to smoke indoors in McFarland.  I stepped inside and was immediately made aware of this fact as plumes of smoke took up residence in my clothes and nose.  \n\nDo not fear, however, there is a separate dining room that is nonsmoking.  And man was this separate dining room packed (Superbowl Sunday).  Packed with large women squeezing into convention center chairs.  Packed with waitresses who wore skin tight white Jordache jeans, giving you a fleeting sense of their giving nature.  Packed with the eager anticipation of an entire day spent watching football and football-related activities: drooling, eating, drinking, and smoking.  God bless America.\n\nThe AM dish to get here is the Walleye and eggs breakfast.  I would tend to agree, although their limited selection of omelets is made marginally more tasty by the addition of broccoli (you heard me punk).  As breakfast wore on, the dining room filled, emptied, and filled again; the waitstaff eagerly setting new places, removing paper place settings, calling people darlin' and hon'(always appreciated).\n\nSo give it to me hard backwoods Wisconsin.

The wings were OUTSTANDING!

They need to tweak the menu to give better value (portion to price) on some items and to right-size other items.  (I can't believe they don't have a small side salad that you can order with a main dish.) The serving staff needs to gain a little more experience as they seemed shaky and unfamiliar with some of the menu items. Lastly, beware of the drink sizes!

You can spot the restaurant from the I-15 it is accessed on Dean Martin Drive ample parking is available out front. Inside, you're met with a deli to your right and lounge to the left. My brother and I came in to dine for lunch. You order at the counter, you're given a number and your food is brought to you over in the lounge. The Deli seemed promising, it reminded me of a petite version of those I love in San Diego and San Francisco. You feel like you're transported into a speakeasy when you step over to the lounge. There is a large bar, oversized booths and table seating. \n\nThe menu offers a variety of appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pizzas and entrees that include pasta, poultry or seafood. They also serve breakfast, though, I'm not sure when its available. My brother chose the Pastrami Rueben ($9.50) with coleslaw and I had the BP Porchetta sandwich with potato salad ($13.50). After a short wait, our lunch was served.\n\nThe Rueben was decent. The pastrami is sliced thin and possibly tossed on the griddle since there were crisp edges. The bread was dry, but the Russian dressing was quite good. Better than most Thousand Island dressings. The coleslaw went uneaten, it was too sweet for both of our tastes. \n\nThe Porchetta sandwich sounded great in theory, but the execution was poor. The greens were limp and slimey. The nuggets of pork belly and pork loin tumbled out from the bread with every bite. The pork loin was tender and had great flavor. I wish it were thinly sliced instead and piled high; it would make for a tasty sandwich. I enjoy pork belly when the fat is properly rendered. It was unfortunate that more than half of the nuggets were tough and filled with flubber. I found those pieces inedible. As a general rule, I do not like potato salad. Majority contain mayo and mustard; my least favorite condiments, this was no exception. I'd prefer alternate options to potato salad and cole slaw since both contain mayonnaise.

The only waitress in the place was either clueless or had never seen tall or chubby folks before because when asked if they had armless chair she just shrugged and walked away to continue the chat we interrupted upon entering.

There is a bar area, individual tables, and sofa seating areas that are very comfortable. The World Cup soccer match was on near the bar are and we were able to watch the games from our table.\n\nFood (4 Stars): I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Asparagus and Crab/Shrimp; the dish was beautiful and tasty too! The hollandaise sauce was super buttery and complemented the seafood. There was also a side of potatoes that gave you a nice break from the richness of the eggs. The english muffin was crispy and not too soggy either. I would order this dish again.\n\nWe had meatballs as an appetizer and it was basically some large croutons with meatballs in tomato sauce. It was okay and the meatballs were pretty dry, but the sauce was yummy and wasn't overly sweet.\n\nService (4 Stars): The service here was interesting. There is always a waiter coming by the refill your water cup, that I could appreciate. Our waiter gave us the wrong menus to order from and we had to switch up some of our orders. It was an honest mistake and I could see that they were trying their best fix the situation. It was just kind of awkward. \n\nBottom line: Compared to other places off the strip for brunch, this place is high up there.

Monday nights at 10:00, porn stars call it a day from their jobs and come to this rather cheery bar with a good vibe to belt out some tunes.  And everybody is super nice.

At this point, all boasting rights I've ever had as an actor are laid silent, because I am never going to beat that.\n\nSo the initial call to new wacky situations was strong enough to summon out the missus, my good friend and I to sit, drink cheap, tasty drinks, and belt out tunes alongside a whole cadre of adult film actors.  And they can sing.  And they also flash more than a few boobs while singing, so if that's also your thing, then there you go.  They even play some crazy games, of which my friend won a prize.\n\nThere may be too many highlights to list, but I think one of my personal favorites was being able to stun a group of porn stars into open mouthed wonder with my rendition of Michael Jackson's \"Rock With You\".  I thought about singing \"How Deep Is Your Love\" from the Bee Gees, but that's perhaps too tacky and obvious.

The bar itself is a nice find right off the strip and the layout is actually pretty nice.  The bar is situated right in front of you as you walked in but the lounge area we were hanging out and watching the game is was off to the side.  The lounge here is what really shines out of the entire place.  it comes with a bunch of projector screens situated around the room and a giant one at the front of the lounge in case you aren't situated by any of the other projectors.  Lots of room to sit around the lounge and, I'm not sure if they always have tables in the middle of the room, but the bar set up some tables for additional seating so everyone can watch the Cowboys game.  Just a head's up though, during the Cowboys game, they allow smoking in the lounge area even though there is a sign that says 'No smoking beyond this point'.  I wasn't too happy about sitting in a smoky room all game so just a head's up for anyone interested in stopping by to watch a Cowboys game at this bar.\n\nRegarding food and drink, they have a standard collection and nothing too crazy.  I'm not sure if it's a Cowboys Club thing, but the bar makes shots for everyone in the bar every time the Cowboys score, which I think is pretty awesome.  But what really stands out here is the Thai food options to order.  Having a Thai food option instead of just straight bar food was pretty nice.  The food was delicious and the portions were a comfortable size but left me a little hungry for the price.  The lady taking our order from the Thai restaurant actually mixed up the Cowboys game time menu with the regular Thai menu and actually charged us more than what was advertised for the Chicken Satay.  She said I was given the regular plate, not the happy hour plate and came back an hour later to collect more money from me even though the price stated on the menu was what I wanted.  At least she made the effort to cross out the Chicken Satay on the game time menu.. but I was still irritated that they made the mistake and decided not to eat the cost instead of pester me about paying up for their mistake.  Aside from that they only other thing I can comment on is the bathroom.  The bathroom was a bit small and I kept bumping into people as I came in and out of the bathroom.\n\nOverall, I've definitely been to much better but it's not that bad here.  I managed to stick it out with the smokiness and mis-charging of food but it definitely fell short of what I consider to be a pleasurable experience (...and I consider myself a pretty easy to please guy).

Comfortable, over sized lounge chairs everywhere.  They have a HUGE California King (or even bigger) in the middle of the joint, where you can sit down, have some drinks on, or lie on.

Start with the jukebox and the photo booth by the bar.  Behind the photo booth, you have a couple of dart boards to enjoy with friends.  Then, there's the shuffleboard.  It's inside and super fun.  Next to it is the pool table and a HUGE corn hole game set up.  My favorite game!  You can always check out the board games they have behind the counter as well.  Go outside and there's another huge cornhole along with two normal sized corn hole games.  Lastly, they have the huge sized Jenga blocks.  That has to be the crowd favorite so far.  So much fun, but watch out!  Each block is heavy and will hurt your toes if it gets in the way.\n\nWhat I appreciate is that within the Grill and the bar, they've kept a lot of the old Gold Spike employees.

Sadly understaffed. Will, the unkempt bartender whose ass crack I saw more than I cared to, was rude, inefficient, dirty looking (I mean, scuzzy) and completely biased toward those he served. If they don't fire this guy then he's obviously in with the bosses. Loser.\n\nA girl with a tramp stamp (you can't miss it, it takes up her whole back) behind the bar with her face in the computer for a good solid 20 minutes (that's how long it took us to get a drink and I STILL don't know what she looks like) ignoring everyone at the bar, that she works at, for a living, to do nothing. Perfect. \n\nWell, that's about it for bartenders on a loud, busy Thursday night. A bar back that we'd asked to help us get oblivious tramp stamp girl's attention snapped at us like we were filthy animals who'd wandered in for a scrap. Maybe a little customer service training is in order. I THINK SO.\n\nOn our way outside to the back through the blasting music that was so loud that if you could hear yourself think you would tell yourself to leave, saw a guy passed clean out. A sonic boom couldn't wake this guy. Because that's how loud the music was and he was snoring heavily. \n\nFinally make it out to see a bunch of seriously young looking kids screaming about Jenga. The fabulous band (with a bass player!) couldn't be heard over the juvenile squeals and blocks crashing of this game that seems fun, but not when you have cool music to listen to. Priorities are not right here. \n\nWe had one great bartender who came over and got us our second drink. She was sweet and very cool. I tried to hand her a tip, but she had walked away (??). I had to call her back. Pretty sure she's not used to that with this entitled whiny crowd. Ugh. I'd die if I had her job. Or, I'd probably go to jail for back handing some of those kids. Where were their parents??\n\nAnyway, avoid until this situation fixes itself, it has so much potential. As of now it's just a joke.\n\nAs an aside I'd say to the manangers: if you want to make money it's not by alienating people who have disposable income to spend and allowing the college level brats who make minimum wage to take over.

As an added bonus, it was within walking distance of the Fremont Street Experience.

Unlike at many other casinos, the blackjack games are not available until the evening. I'm not a huge fan of card games, but people who do enjoy them may find this to be a turn-off. On the other hand, the blackjack dealers were really attractive, and it was fun chatting with them.\n\nDespite its few shortcomings, Gold Spike is quite nice for an off-Strip hotel. I overall recommend this place.\n\n-- TL;DR version --\n\nHighs: Low nightly rates; located conveniently close to the Fremont Street Experience; the card dealers are smokin' hot\nLows: Blackjack available only in the evening; the Wi-Fi needs improvement\nBottom line: Despite being located in a seedy area, Gold Spike is a fairly welcoming place.\nFinal verdict: 3.8 stars (rounded up to four)", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I walked in here with no idea as to what it was and what it looked like except that it was renovated from a hotel and there are apparently life-sized games.\n\nMy first impression was that Gold Spike is HUGE!

When I went this last January, I finally made the time to get over there for a 3:00pm breakfast. If I knew what I know now about the Peppermill, I'd beat my own ass for not going sooner.\nThe lettering on the outside said a lot when I see \"PEPPERMILL\" spelled out in a rainbow of neon lights.  My friend Kristina and I skipped in excitement through the doors and entered in jaw-dropping bewilderment. Chills ran down our spines as we were slapped in the face with what I can only describe as pure neon splendor. A resounding WOW was all we could say until the hostess made us snap out of it and asked how many in out party. I couldn't help but ask her, \"Do you get a headache working here?\" She giggled and said,\" When I first started, I thought there was no way I could work here for long, but you get use to it.\" \nAs she led us through the forest of silk trees and flowers to our table, we admired her classicly tacky floral uniform and shimmery tights. I've never been more jealous of a working environment. The menu was large and filled with a huge assortment of breakfast, lunch, and dinner items.. always being served.\nI called my brother in law for \"must-haves\" and was told to get the Bloody Mary, among other specialties. I went ahead and ordered my Tower of Bloody Mary and it was amazing. I'm a sucker for biscuits and gravy, so we ordered that.. along with the Fantasia waffle. A belgian waffle covered in fresh fruit, blueberry syrup and choice of whipped cream or sour cream. We ate until we thought we would explode, but the fun didn't end there.\nRumors of the breathtaking \"Fireside Lounge\" and it's famous fire pit drew us to it's glory. If I thought the neon goodness was only in the restaurant, I was extremely mistaken. Take all the yummy neon lights, then dim the rest of the lights, add some pink couches and cocktail waitresses in gowns and full make-up (no matter the time of day).. you have yourself the Fireside Lounge. Oh wait! It gets better... The FIRE PIT!! I've never seen anything so amazing. Imagine a tiny jacuzzi with fire coming out of it and the vent lined with little TV's showing the hottest sporting event. Nothing short of fantastic.

My English muffin was burnt and I didn't quite understand why I had three poached eggs. BFF had the Joe's Special, which sounded really delicious. We fought over who would order it. It was a mix of scrambled eggs, sausage, some veggies, served over potato skins, with cheese sauce. Sounds delish, but wasn't. The potato skins were just boiled potato chunks and the cheese sauce was bright orange. There was nothing real about that cheese sauce. \n\nFor our two meals and two sodas, it was $36.

All the tables are normal table height, so there's no problem accommodating very young eaters.\n\nThe menu is similar to the best of NYC diners. Namely, there's almost anything on it, from eggs to fried chicken to steak to pancakes. As for the kids menu, it's small and very basic. There are chicken fingers, mac and cheese with fruit, grilled cheese, bacon and eggs, french toast and the very awesome pancake face. The prices are very reasonable (all the kids menu items are either $5.95 or $6.95) and if your child is older or more adventurous they can of course order from the complete adult menu. And don't forget, you're in Vegas so The Peppermill is open 24 hours, 7 days a week including all holidays. \n\nAs for the service, here in Las Vegas we have pretty high standards, and in the seven years I've been going there I've never had anything but an outstanding waitress who has been super friendly to my kids.\n\nThe Peppermill is the perfect combination of good food and outstanding Vegas kitsch.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Went here to try out \"The Scorpion\" the big drink they serve out of that fishbowl glass.

New York ! 27.95 (yes, the price is quite high) ***PEPPERMILL DESCRIPTION: 12oz. hand-cut and trimmed, flame-broiled to perfection and served with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms.*** Let me tell you that for someone that actually does NOT consider herself a red meat lover and eats it only on rare occassions (even though all my reviews seem to be centered on steak houses and burger joints LOL!), THIS WAS EXCELLANT EXCELLANT EXCELLANT! The kitchen staff really know their steaks! I thought there was a bone in it and kept eating around it...it was all cut with no bone! And being pregnant I had to order it more cooked than I would usually so I believe I got it Medium-Well...still amazing! Flavorful AND tender! So 5 stars there!\nOn another night (with our little one), we went just for dessert and ordered the Strawberry Shortcake 6.95\n***PEPPERMILL DESCRIPTION: Moist slices of pound cake, a generous helping of strawberries and creamy French vanilla ice cream, all topped with real whipping cream.*** WHAT A TREAT! Fantastic! LOVED IT! We were all so tired and our little boy started getting cranky and fighting over bites and finally it ended up toppeling all over the table! Haha, it was a fun night. We love the Peppermill! ***Don't forget to wave to the kitchen staff on your way out. They REALLY appreciate that. :)\nFIRESIDE LOUNGE: When my man and I go to Las Vegas as adults, we LOVE the Fireside Lounge in all it's glowing ambiance!

I'm at about a 3.5 to 4 for the Peppermill Restaurant and a solid 5 for the Fireside Lounge.\n\nLet's start with the Fireside Lounge. This is one of my favorite places in Vegas. I've loved it since I first visited Vegas years and years ago. It's one of the first places that springs to mind when I think of \"old Vegas\". This little tucked away lounge is both classy and neon. It's both laid-back and fun. I can just picture any classic Vegas star sitting on a couch here.\n\nThe Fireside Lounge is pretty small. When you walk into the Peppermill, you'll see a small glass door off to your left labeled \"Fireside Lounge\". When you walk through it, you'll see lots of blues, pinks, and greens, bits of neon, mirrors, and plenty of fake plants and trees. But it so works, it feels classy - old Vegas classy.\n\nTo your right is a small, low bar with some video poker. To your left is a large indoor fire pit / flaming pool thing. Around the indoor fire pit / flaming pool thing is a huge circle couch. Around the rest of the room are smaller couches and some chairs - in an array of different sizes to accommodate just your size group. And the way it is all laid out, it is not too hard to find a private corner for some snuggling.\n\nOn corners around the room are TVs playing all sorts of music videos. Sometimes it 80s hair bands, sometimes it's a live Pearl Jam show. It's different just about every time I go. And it's never too loud. It's just there in the background, providing ambiance and conversation starters.\n\nThe best part is that the cocktail waitresses wear long, black evening gowns. It just adds to the whole environment and experience. There's a decent cocktail list and bar snack menu. Don't expect anything inventive here (though, they have been trying some new martinis). It's all classic and old-fashioned (and that is what is going to taste the best here). Think Mai Tai and shrimp cocktail.\n\nCombine all that with it being open-24 hours and you've got a must-do. It can be a romantic spot for couples and a chill spot for a group of guys or gals. And I've seen a few celebrities here too. Not the type that host at Pure, but the type that you might catch performing at The Joint.\n\nAnd I have to add that the staff at the Fireside are pretty open and willing to accommodate. My husband decided to surprise me with an Elvis impersonator for my birthday, and he set it all up with Fireside for this Elvis to come in and sing to me. So yeah, Fireside is totally a 5 star place.\n\nSo on to the Peppermill Restaurant. Sure, there are better 24 hour restaurants in Vegas, but almost none with this kind of atmosphere. And the food is well above average. I can't say I've eaten here a lot, but the handful of times I have, I haven't had any complaints. \n\nThe portions are huge - so don't be afraid to share. My favorite menu items are actually the omelettes. They're huge and flavorful (no going stingy on the cheese and fillers here), and they just really hit the spot after a long night of drinking and gaming. 3.5 stars for the food, but add 1/2 a star for the ambiance.\n\nThe Peppermill Restaurant and Fireside Lounge are novelty Vegas places not to be missed.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 4, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "This place belongs in Vegas!

The eggs, I tried their scrambled eggs and they were tastier than average and fluffier than normal. Plus, I opted with a side of White Toast. The Toast was ordinary but it came with a delicious strawberry jam.

Nice soft butter and maple syrup (not too thick) just brought it home!

Not bad but Nothing compared to the Southern/Chicken Fried Steak. This also came with a small slices of apples and sauce. The side of Hash Browns.. You know how I feel about those! This time, I went with egg whites and a bagel with cream cheese for the included choice of sides.

Really???  You walk in to a restaurant and you see neon rainbow lights, slot machines, dogwood trees and waitresses dressed up in skittles colored uniforms.  The visual entertainment alone is enticing enough for me to go there time and time again.  Even the sugar on the table is rainbow colored.\n\nThe food portions are humongous and I think if you are an average eater, you can get one meal and split it with someone and both of you would walk out full and content.  The food is pretty good, I wouldn't say that it's the best--but again---you're paying for the experience.  The prices are a little bit higher than an average family restaurant but, hey---someone has to pay for the electricity that's used in lighting up those colorful neon lights.  =0)  The service has always been great every time that I've gone.  So, give the restaurant side a try.\n\nHowever--should you decide to pass the Peppermill Restaurant up---DO NOT pass up the opportunity to experience the Fireside Lounge.  Not everyone knows, but the Fireside Lounge was actually used in a scene for the movie Casino with Robert Deniro and Sharon Stone.  Apparently, Deniro hung out there during the filming of the movie and he liked it so much that they decided to use it as a scene in the movie.  Aside from the movie trivia attached to this lounge, the experience is truly unique.  I would say that it's quite romantic and great for dates and especially a first date.  If you end up getting a little toasty around the fire on the velvet red couches, there are other areas in the lounge that offer secluded areas for private conversation.  The area is pretty dim and it's got the nightlife feel to it.  So, give it a try!!  And take a few pictures for us!!!  \n\nYvette L.

So when my wife and I were in Vegas, we decided to check out the Fireside Lounge. \n\nIt's a dark little bar lit mostly with Neon, there is their signature fire pit, a pool of water with fire bubbling out of it. Instead of regular tables, they have cozy little couches you sit in either next to the fire (which was a little too warm for our tastes in July) or roomy booths you can sit in. The atmosphere reminded me of a mix between a Hollywood portrayal of old school Vegas and a strip club... but not in a bad way. We both found it very comfortable and relaxing. \n\nThe service was fantastic! We never went without drinks, the waitress would check on us even if she could see that we were still working on our drinks. She answered questions, was very personable and polite. This was some of the best service we had in Vegas.\n\nWe wanted something light for lunch so we ordered the Crab cakes. WOW these were good! They where flaky, delicious and the sauce the drizzled on top complimented the crab flavor immensely! I would highly recommend giving them a try!\n\nWe had a couple of their specialty drinks. The Blue Hawaiian, which was our favorite. It was very good, and very blue! We also had the Scorpion, which is best described as a fishbowl filled with alcohol and ice cream, it was good, but it took the two of us almost an hour to finish it and it was very filling. After we were done, we were in a little bit of misery until we could walk it off. \n\nOne of the neatest novelty things this bar has is the drink guns. They can push one button on the gun and it will automatically pour the drink. It gives consistency to their signature drinks so no matter who makes it; it will always be the same.

It seemed like we bothered her a bit at first because we kept moving around, but she warmed up to us in the end.  One of my friends knew the manager so she came by and helped us out too.  We didn't wait too long for anything, and we had an endless supply of beer nuts.  Everyone seemed pretty chill.  No need to impress or go above and beyond; just very casual and relaxed.  All the waitresses wore long \"gowns-could-be-a-homecoming-dress\".  I thought it was a nice touch.  I mean, why not right?\n\nThe goods:  I'm not a heavy drinker, I just had a couple beers.  There was a complaint that the beers weren't cold so the manager put some on ice for us before she brought them out.  I had a sip of my friend's margarita on the rocks and that was pretty tasty.  Another friend ordered nachos.  They weren't bad.  It was really dark, but I'm almost positive there was mozzarella cheese on them.  Different, but not bad.  I don't think many people come for the food, and if you do, you'll  probably be disappointed.  \n\nThe atmosphere: This is why Fireside has a reputation.  Firepit surrounded by water, bubbled by jets.  It's like Satan's jacuzzi.  We sat in the pit for a little bit, but there were quite a few of us so we ended up moving to a different booth.  The booths are comfortable, squishy, and I liked the throw pillows.  Lots of \"greenery\", helps make some of the booths more private.  I requested that we stay in a booth that was somewhat well lit and very public, Lord knows what happens in those private booths.  This is a pretty cool place, not pretentious at all.  We ended up swapping stories of previous visits to Fireside.  If you're skittish or conservative, I would recommend coming early in the evening or not at all.  This place gets pretty diverting in the late hours.  The pimps and their girls will come in and have their cocktails, and if you're lucky, there'll be a mild drug exchange going on in a booth next to you.  A lot of the transvestites frequent this joint too...I think because the lighting is almost nonexistent (jk).  They're really friendly, so be prepared to converse with strangers.  Every now and again some famous someone or other will drop in too.  Again, probably because of the lack of lighting, so they can enjoy some privacy.  There are TVs everywhere and we enjoyed the old-school to not so old-school music they played.  The Beach Boys are getting ollllllllllld, but still so lovable.  I think this is a place for an older crowd, but a fresh pup with an open mind could probably really enjoy it.\n\nWe went for my going away party and I'm not disappointed.  We had a good time and we didn't bother anyone with our volume.  I would recommend this place for a casual get-together, but not if you're looking for a sit down dinner.  If you just want a place to chill, relax and shoot the shit, Fireside Lounge is a good spot.  Just be aware of your location and understand that anything can happen.

The Peppermill has been on the north end of the Vegas strip for over thirty years. Many a casino has come and gone in those years but the Peppermill and the adjacent Firseide Lounge has survived.

This makes it a perfect late night stop or the place to cure your morning after hangover. For Simone and I, it was the hangover cure, and we arrived mid morning and were immediately seated.  After looking over the waitress, I mean menu, I decided to order the Reuben Sandwich and French Fries. Simone decided to go for the Breakfast menu and ordered a spinach, feta and tomato omelete with hash browns and a Bran Muffin. My Reuben arrived first and it was massive. In fact, it was a club sandwich with three grilled and buttery homemade slices of Rye bread. Between the first two slices of bread was a heaping mound of fresh sauerkraut with gooey melted Swiss and house made thousand island dressing. The kraut was marinated perfectly with the flavor of whole caraway seeds and was excellent as the bed for the thinly sliced pound or so of grilled pastrami which was piled high on the next layer of rye bread with more melted Swiss. This was the holy grail of sandwiches and I amazingly finished the entire thing. The fries were a little to thick cut for my taste but were still fried crisp and were a good side to my sandwich.  Simones omelet was almost equal in size to my sandwich . It was packed full of spinach , cheese and tomatoes and even had some surprise hash browns mixed in with it ( hopefully not left over on the grill from the day before). Simone was a light weight and only downed about 1/4 of her monster meal. The hash browns that came with the omelet were grated fresh and were grilled crispy on the outside and tender in the middle, just the way they should be and i gladly helped Simone finish them.  The bran muffin also had good flavor and was nice, fresh and moist.\nThe Peppermill is a great experience. Come hungry, because there is plenty to eat and you will want to finish it all.

And, as we entered and left the restaurant, every served dish I saw on other diners' plates looked massive, well crafted, and tasty.\n\nI began our late dinner with a bowl of Beef Barley Soup.  It contained cubed beef, barley, mushroom slices, tomato, celery, and a real tasty, oily beef broth.  The only negative is that the mushrooms appeared to be of the canned variety.  \n\nAn excellent Spinach Salad with egg, fresh spinach leaves, bacon, and a Catalina Dressing that tasted like Hot Bacon Dressing was next, followed by a BLTA packed with bacon, red tomato, lettuce, an ample smear of mayonnaise, and huge, beautifully green and yellow, cool chunks of perfectly ripe avocado on lightly toasted Sourdough Bread as I had requested.  Numerous French Fries were also on the plate, because I had forgotten to order desired Potato Salad, which was an included alternative, along with a choice of cottage cheese, onion rings, or a fruit cup.  So, just a little belatedly, I ordered and paid for a side of Potato Salad.  When it arrived in a large teardrop dish, my work in dispatching this large side, along with my jam-packed sandwich, began.  But it was easy to do, for this excellent creamy white, mayonnaise-based Dill Potato Salad with skin-on Red Potatoes and celery was simply delicious.  The Fries were good, but I enjoyed the Potato Salad more.\n\nDiane, meanwhile, raved about the 3 large and juicy Arctic Cod fillets and the incredible amount of crisp deep-fried Curly Fries that covered her platter and constituted an order of Icelandic Fish and Chips.  She also very much liked her excellent, rich Hot Chocolate with Whipped Cream.  As usual, I finished all of my meal, and Diane ate what she could, and had the rest packed for lunch at home.\n\nBut we were by no means done.  I had my eye on another Peppermill offering as soon as I read through the gargantuan menu, and Diane was game, as well.  So, to cap off a fine dinner, we ordered a Colossal Hot Fudge Sundae to share.\n\nAnd, this was some sundae.  Besides a generous supply of French Vanilla Ice Cream in a large and high elongated glass sundae dish, this treat featured mini-chocolate chips, chopped peanuts, a mountain of whipped cream, an obligatory cherry on top, and a load of warm and sweet Hot Fudge (see pic)--likely four times the amount of Hot Fudge one will find in the average Hot Fudge Sundae served elsewhere.  I asked our server how many scoops of ice cream were in our sundae, and she replied that normally 3 scoops are included but this was the first one she had ever made, and because she wanted us to be pleased with it, she had put in FIVE SCOOPS!  I highly recommend this dish--but not for just 1 person!  It was so wonderfully good that Diane and I finished it all--but just barely! \n\nThis was a great meal with very friendly and mostly great service.

My complaint was they had been covered wt white cheese & baked in the oven and the end result was a concrete textured layer covering them. Also there was very little sign of any chicken whatsoever, though we did find a few small pcs upon a close inspection.\n\n The Nacho's were served wt 2 small cups of sour cream, a chedder cheese sauce & salsa all on the side and was pretty sparse on the other ingredients advertised - tomatoes, blk olives, jalepenos & onions. My expectations were more of a zesty, loose array of all advertised ingredients as I am accustomed  Sort of like a Taco Salad, where one can build each chip as an individual h'orderve. The concrete texture, as well as the limited ingredients, prevented this. Still it was good, but I wouldnt order it again.\n\nThe waitress, overall atmospere & company was very nice and based on my experience I would have no problem going back, or reccommending it to others.

That's usually my quota for six months.  I've never been a big fan of home fries, but these were the bomb;  I just couldn't stop eating them.

Vegas, in all good and tacky senses.\n\nTHE ATMOSPHERE:\nIt feels like cheers bar for locals meets las Vegas disco ball. Homey, delicious, friendly.\n\nTHE DECOR:\nBeing inside is like stepping direcrly into a neon lined disco ball. There is disco glass all over the pillars and ceilings, only to be distracted by the giant TV screens and neon lighting lining everything. There is a cool lounge in the back area, but we opted for the bustling brunch in the restaurant in the front. Think Denny's on a flamboyant gay cruise in the 80's and you kinda have Peppermill, except with fantastic food and gigantic portions.\n\nI fell in love with the decor big time. Each table is a booth, which I love, and has big leather couches. It's arranged so you aren't hidden, but each table has their own little alcove. Like a buncha totally-visible secret gardens or something. Maybe i say garden because there are giant fake trees throughtout, and flowers and vines at each table draping down from the ceiling. Also, big flamingo Tiffany's -esque lamps hover over each table with a full moon, making it almost seem like you're watching a flock of flamingoes grazing at night. It's almost peaceful. \n\nTHE FOOD:\nThe coffee, so necessary after any 1/2-decent night out in Vegas, is Columbian and served in a big cup with free refills. All about it.\n\nMy friends and I shared:\n1) Munch's breakfast, which was saut\u00e9ed peppers, onions, and linguica sausage over hash browns with 2 eggs any way on top. It was good, and huge, but nothing to write home about.\n2) Maserati omelette - this is Meaty-tomato italian sauce, melted jack and cheddar cheeses, hasbrowns. Served with toast, a bagel, or a muffin. This was fantastic. I would never think that spaghetti sauce would pair well with an omelette, but this was excellent and worth ordering. \n\nWith your meal comes a free 4x6 photo souveneir -- so cheezy, so Vegas, so perfect.

Oh my, what a trip.\n\nWe drove up to this restaurant down toward the older part of the strip around 11:20AM on a Saturday  morning; there were people waiting outside.  We decided to try it anyway & went inside the where the hostess took our name for a 35 minute wait.  We went to check out the lounge - you MUST check out the lounge.\n\nTacky might be a good adjective but fun tacky like a walk back into the 70s.

The bar was full with some patrons playing video poker while others just took in the scene.  The focal point of the lounge, however, is the step down fire pit with the flame glowing in the middle of a pool of water.  There was a guest of honor from a bachelorette party interestingly clad with various monetary units & mints hanging from her ensemble hamming it up two couples who wandered in with their 70's garb and took multiple \"what happens in Vegas stays...\" photos.  It was a free show!  Oh, the drinks were fine - my bloody Mary was a bit pricey but it did come in a hurricane glass (remember those?)\n\nWhen our name was called for brunch - we were seated at a window booth (all booth seating).  The floral motif continued and was accompanied by tiffany style lighting.  We saw omelets the size of your head go by - and the line outside continued.  Since it was the noon hour by this time we chose to order sliders & pesto chicken sandwich from our waitress wearing a carhop type of getup (short skirt).  Both food orders were really good and accompanied by a copious pile of fries. \n\nPeppermill seems to be a local favorite but many taxis came through too.

You get a mini loaf of warm banana bread!  Skip the marshmellow sauce if its too heavy.\n\n*Tostada Omelet ($13.50): It certainly tastes better than it looks. It's a big plate of messy omelet with black olives, zesty beef and diced tomatoes. Looks like nacho. It comes with hash brown AND tortilla chips.\n\n*Sausage and Three Eggs ($11.95): Probably the smallest plate in the house and you can substitute Canadian bacon or ham. My scrambled eggs were okay-fluffy and the sausages are of the low-grade. Very greasy and fatty. Instead of toast I requested a blueberry muffin for a taste. It was steamy hot but chewy. Not very good.\n\n*Extraordinary Oatmeal ($9.50): Sprinkled with raisins, walnuts, and banana galore. Healthy option. \n\nIt's so much food that most people pack it up and take it to-go.

This place does an all day breakfast, and their portions are serious.  The ham steak is literally the size of a large dinner plate, and they grill it so that it gets some great flavor!  Their hash browns are great too, and they use real potatoes!  And I like that they use shredded potatoes that they griddle the heck out of, because I like my hash browns crispy.  And for those that want/need a drink in the morning, maybe to recover from the night before, they have a full bar from the lounge next door that you can order from.

We went to the fireside lounge and I immediately fell in love with the decor and ambiance of the fireside lounge.   Then I ordered food, and now, this place is a must visit whenever I go to Vegas.  So, when I was trying to find a place to hold my wedding reception, EVERYWHERE we thought of wanted a $5,000 minimum.  I had to keep it cheap.  I thought of Peppermill, but thought the place is too nice, it'll be just as pricey as the rest, if not pricier.  I was pleasantly surprised that I was wrong!!!!  They had a catering menu that topped ALL the other menus I had seen so far, they had steak, chicken, pasta, and salmon all on their $28/ plate catering menu.  They asked for no minimum and no pre-ordering.  So I didn't have to spend time asking people ahead of time if they want chicken or steak which was awesome, because planning even the smallest wedding on your own is hard!  I was in touch with a woman named Peggy Orth the entire time, and she made everything even EASIER!  She was pleasant to deal with, prompt in returning emails, and made a few excellent suggestions.  This is all leading up to my big day.   So the day comes.  They had to wait for people to clear out to make room for my 80+ guests.  All of us went to wait in the fireside lounge, and EVERYBODY loved the lounge as much as I did.  Our tables were all ready in about 10 minutes.  Our food was delicious, and it came quick, especially for not having pre-ordered.  The staff made sure my husband and I had our own \"wedding\" table and made us feel like royalty.  Peggy did an excellent job, i would loved to have met her, but she wasn't working that day.  And that goes to show what a great manager she must be, because she's obviously very organized a good at what she does to set up a party of 80 people and have it go off without a hitch when she's not even there.\nPeppermill is on my official list of All-time favorite places in the world!!!

The entire environment seemed to emit Vegas-style retroness with fake indoor palm trees, colorful sugar, and a disco-like vibe.\n\nSince I knew the portions would be huge, my boyfriend and I decided to share a meal. We decided to order the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS (that comes with hash browns). In addition, since it was the morning and it looked like every other table ordered some, my boyfriend decided to order a BLOODY MARY to go along with the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS. The cocktail waitress was very nice in explaining it to him since he didn't know how it worked. You actually get to choose the type of Vodka you would like in it and they use their own secret list of spices to be included. As for it being brunch time, in Vegas, you would have to be drinking every time of the day. \n\nMy cousin decided to order the PEPPERMILL SAMPLER (golden fried shrimp, breaded chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, bruschetta and batter dipped onion rings) for all of us to share. And that was the first thing that came out and man, did we have to share. The entire thing was huge. Sadly, I was only able to try the mozzarella sticks (which were very warm and gooey inside with cheese after being dipped into marinara sauce--yummy!) and an onion ring (I've had better elsewhere). The rest I left to the others in my group to try. \n\nMy boyfriend's BLOODY MARY came out next. Being his first time, it wasn't bad. I tasted it as well and it did taste like V8 with a little bit of Vodka with seasoning in it for better flavor. He actually finished the whole thing and was glad his first time was at Peppermill. \n\nFinally, our main entree came out, the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS (with hashbrowns). It was super crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside and with that gravy on top made it even that much savory. The hashbrowns also had a nice top crunch to it which I love. \n\nOverall, we came out very stuffed. Luckily, since we shared, we were able to eat all of the CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS. I wouldn't have been able to if I went into this as a lone person. \n\nGreat first time experience.

The sausage had gross texture and flavor. Everything about the dish was sub-par, which was particularly annoying when one takes into account how EXPENSIVE the whole meal was. I know things in Vegas aren't cheap, but a simple egg scramble with some veggies and meat for like $14? Come on! For all 10 of us the meal came out to around $225. No one, and I mean no one, at our table enjoyed the dining experience at The Peppermill. The service was rude, the food was terrible and overpriced.

I ate a quarter of it for dinner and had leftovers for three more meals! My husband ordered The Conquest, which is a glorified roast beef sandwich, with a side of onion rings. I think they may have changed the recipe on the rings -- they seem to be more panko-y and less beer batter-y -- and the portion seemed bigger than in the past. But they were great, and as I said before, they may be the only thing that's changed since 1998.\n\nAfter dinner, we stopped in the lounge for a cocktail. Visiting the lounge is an event in itself. More mirrors, more neon, and a circular fire pit to entertain you and your date while you soak up the vibe.

So ending up near the airport down by Sahara on this week night in Veags was just another level of confussion. \n\nThe mentality of Las Vegas is so grossly atavistic that a really massive crime can often slip by unrecognized.  The Blue Ox Tavern is no stranger to this sort of life style. Though I have to say that I was really surprised that upon coming here one night after an already long evening of drinking at a German beer house, we had to get buzzed into the place. \n\nYes, that's right. Buzzed into a bar. And while the Blue Ox seemed like a fairly safe haven from our storms with copious amounts of German schnitzel and alcohol, What with no hassles (besides the door), no talk, It was just a place to rest and regroup. I wasn't even hungry, which was sort of a shame because the happy hour/late bird menu really looked tasty. \n\nThere's a rule in Vegas - Don't burn the locals. The main reason why you should follow it, is so that the same locals you didn't burn can take you to places like this. We were the only people in this bar on this weeknight. While I'm not sure if it was because of that, but the bartender would constantly come to the table and ask if we wanted another round. \n\nYeah, there's nothing like sobering up with more alcohol. And while their selection wasn't that great, they at least had New Castle. A classic favorite of mine. \n\nFound out that this place is a gathering spot for Minnesotans in the weekly sacrament of watching their Vikings play. For a second there I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing that Las Vegas would have a lot of Minnesota transplants.\n\nOh well, I guess the only real draw back to this place is that at the late hours you have to get buzzed in. I mean, that alone makes you feel like you're in a scummy area.

Had intended to come by on a Sunday when the Vikings were playing and enjoy the food and atmosphere, but that unfortunately never pan out with the work schedule.  Anyway, I came on a slow Saturday night, and the place was pretty empty (just a few guests, a bar tender and waitress and whoever was working in the kitchen).\n\nTheir menu is pretty simple.  Most items were under $10.  after checking out the menu, I decided to get a cup of their Soup of the Day, some Chicken Fingers and a burger with 2x 1/2 lb Angus beef patties.  Oh and a soda.  The whole meal came out to be $22 plus change.  Not bad at all.\n\nThe Chicken Finger was nice and hot and was pretty good (a bit too salty for me, but once it gets a quick dunk in the dipping sauce it was fine).  The burger was juicy and packed a lot of calories.  Had I forced myself to finish it, it would have qualified for a 1#er burger challenge.  But I opted to finish my soup and chicken fingers, and left the last 3 bites for the dumpster.\n\nThe waitress was cool.  Took my order and pretty much left me alone, except to bring the food and check on my Coke for refills.  I pretty much planted myself in front of the TV and watch the 1st Qtr of the college football game that was on at the time.\n\nI think this is a good place to get decent bar food at a reasonable price.

They have a small meeting room in the back that can be used for private parties or club meetings.\n\nThe decor is very understated, it has a older vibe with paneling and tons of wildlife and lake photos on the walls.\n\nThe Staff is always friendly, the owner will come around and personally thank you for coming in and see if there is anything they can do to make your visit better.\n\nOne thing that is a little different about the Ox is the customers. I'm not sure if you have ever heard of the saying \"Minnesota Nice\", but trust me they are. I have been to locals bars where all the customers are Slot Zombies and you can't get a word out of them. However, at the Ox, everyone is pretty approachable, and are always willing to talk about pretty much anything.\n\nThe Ox is a MN bar so the default \"home team\" is the vikings.

Don't come in on a Sunday and expect to get another team on the TV's as far as they know in the ox, there is only one game on Sundays and it's the Vikings game.\n\nThey have some great game day specials that include Brats and Beer (does it get any better?). Most of the time they do special half time buffet during the Vikings Monday Night games. \n\nTheir menu us full of Midwestern delights. You won't find Tofu or many vegetarian or vegan options on the menu, however you will find plenty of cow, chicken, and pig. Their Roast Beef is amazing, they have 3 sandwich options, and I strongly recommend the Timberwolves French Dip. I have yet to have anything on their menu that I wouldn't order again (and I've ate over 2/3rds of it!).\n\nIf you are a fan on MN sports, attentive staff, friendly patrons, cheap drinks, and some really good Midwestern Bar food, it's pretty hard to beat The Ox. \n\nI have said for a while now that if you were to remove the VP machines and put in a box of pull tabs you would have any bar back in MN.

And up until just a few seconds ago, I was still completely uninformed about the significance of \"Blue Ox\", except it has some connection to Minnesota.  So if you are curious about the name, here is a brief Cliff Notes notation about this trivia:\n\nBlue Ox is actually named Babe, and is Paul Bunyan's animal companion.\n\nBlue Ox was also a professional roller hockey team based in Minneapolis, MN, that used to played in the Roller Hockey International League.\n\nBut if you are expecting the interior of the tavern/sports bar to be all blue, you will be disappointed.  Hues of light pink is what you will most likely be covered with regardless of where you decided to park your hiney for the duration of your visit. But don't worry, your eyes are very good at filter that out, but it could get problematic when you try to take pictures of your food, menu or other picture worthy subject matters.  \n\nAnyway, I was here recently to catch the slightly more than half of the most boring Super Bowl event in recent memory. The place was fairly busy, but there were still a few tables and booth that were unoccupied when I walked in.  The average age of the patron was easily over 35 (and I am lowballing my guestimate), so if you are looking for young wild and crazy sports bar scene, this is probably not your best bet.  Best surprise of the afternoon was the complimentary half time buffet that was sponsored by a local law firm (the hot links and other sausages and sides were a definite hit).\n\nTheir regular menu is your typical, non-gourmet bar food.  You have your appetizers (mostly fried items and nachos), salads, sandwiches, burgers, and breakfast items.  I had a bowl of soup (changes daily), and one of their burgers on both visits.  Food is decent and portion is relatively large (but nothing to rave about in our local weekly magazines), and most items are under $10.  \n\nService is decent. The waitresses checks up on you regularly, so your refills or next order of beer is practically effortless.  If you stop in to this sports bar when there are no games on, you could save $1 with your Yelp Check-in off.\n\nOverall, I like this vintage sports bar that has persevered through the years with the occasional event promotions to draw in regulars and snag a few newbies.

Everything was going great until SLADE came along. Slade was our slick, \"I-really-ought-to-be-in-LA-acting\" waiter.

And yes, my parents speak English...like the kind you can understand!)\n\nTwo seconds after settling to our table, he asks what we would like to drink. I have never felt pressured in my life to think of an alcoholic concoction. Five seconds had passed, and Slade was already sending off telepathic messages to me, saying \"hurry up, bitch, you're wasting my time.\" So I finally blurted out, \"Could you please give us a couple of minutes to think.

One time, my son unknowingly set his water glass on HALF the napkin, and Slade was right there to set things right for him, accompanied with an annoyed sigh, of course. Never once did he ask if we needed anything else...he just wanted to make sure that our glasses were on napkins!\n\nThank god for the food, and the drinks. Those did not fail us.

I finally found a place here that can make a good mojito!  Woohoo!  I watched the bartender make it himself, sans pre-mix, and he muddled the mint in front of my very eyes.  I saw the Champagne Celebration on the menu but worried it would be too sweet so I opted to have a Kir Royale.  The bartender suggested the Celebration and assured me it wouldn't be too sweet so I ordered it.  It was fantastic!  It was one of the prettiest drinks I've ever had, with colored rock sugar sprinkled on top (which gives it a ever so faint cotton candy aftertaste) and it is basically a mix of a Kir Royale and a Bellini.  My husband asked for  suggestion and was told the Side Car, which he found too sweet and came with a sugar rimmed glass. He then moved to a tried and true Bombay Sapphire martini that was well made and his glass was poured so full that we could clearly see the meniscus on the top.  (And I'm sure we were the only people in the place that knew what a meniscus was...)  The bartender was a little slow in making one of my drinks so he comped it for us which I appreciated.  I wasn't bothered by it because he was the only bartender and clearly could have used help as he had to prepare all the drinks for the bar and the tables.\n\nWe didn't order dinner food but I plan on returning with my BFF in two weeks for dinner.  The food is insanely inexpensive, its cheaper than at Chili's!  The atmosphere is great, it's very trendy and upbeat yet still understated.

(Love you A!) and it was amazingly yummy.  \n\nThe place is fairly casual really, most folks were wearing their best mall duds from Express so it wasn't overly dressy at all.  In fact, there was a guy in a Budweiser trucker hat that he clearly got for free somewhere. (I will not get into my feelings on trucker hats, Budweiser trucker hats or free hats....)  My husband was in shorts and a t-shirt and he felt fine.  (Plenty of guys came in wearing flip flops...yet another thing I won't get into!)

Two bars, one of the best and one of the worst in the valley. A great example of opposites.  I hope you enjoy reading both!\n\nWelcome to AZ 88. This is the perfect example of a successful bar. The name is simple, it was opened in 1988 by Kopp; a name synonymous with frozen custard, ask anyone in Wisconsin! The owners also own a bar in New York, Bar 89, and Elsa's in Milwaukee.  I have been to Bar 89 in New York when I lived there, and I've gotta say, very much like AZ 88. \n\nNow some of you out there are a bit skeptical because of AZ 88 rep. Let me put you at ease, AZ 88 is not a gay bar, well not entirely. Yeah there are a few from the gay community but at the same time there are performing art fans on nights when there's an event. So it's as much as a performing arts bar, straight bar as it is a gay bar. Think of it this way, I find it a great place to bring a date (especially a first date) for a late dinner and drinks. Hey guys think of it this way, your date may not get hit on as much here as most bars and your date will rave about her Cosmo! \n\nThe eats here are some of the best you'll find in a bar. The Hell's Fire chips are house made potato chips, fried to order and basted with hot sauce and blue cheese. Too good not to order, a must, just don't order with a martini, it won't work with a heavy gin or vodka drink. If you must drink hard, have a Cosmo with the Hell's. The Alfredo burger is a winner too, a burger basted with creamy Alfredo sauce. Also, try the spicy, grilled chicken sandwich with jalapenos and honey. This may seem bizarre to you but it works, when you bite into the sandwich its sweet at first then finishes spicy, great flavor. Everything I've tried here is a home run. From apps to sandwiches, fruit plate to burgers, I've never been let down, kudos to the kitchen staff.\n\nAs for the drinks, you may not find any better in town. Order a Jack and Coke and you'll get a rock glass with Jack served with a small, retro, glass bottle of Coke. Sit at the bar and order a martini and watch as the bartender shakes ever drop out into your glass as the martini itself convexes over the top of your glass making you first sip a 'lean over'.  The bar is well stocked, with just about every liquor you'd expect. I judge the best bars by 1st the vodka selection, then bourbon, tequila and lastly rum. It's unfortunate people don't order more rum, especially here, they have Appleton Estate Black Label, a scotch drinkers rum, try it on the rocks; it'll change your life. The beer selection is great too, as with wine by the glass. No matter who you're with, the size of your party, everyone is sure to find a drink to their liking. \n\nThe places design and d\u00e9cor is unrivaled in the valley because of one simple truth, its ever changing. The artwork changes constantly. Go around Christmas and see the most radical Christmas tree ever. Hey, I'm Jewish and I go every year to see their tree! One year it was hundreds of silver painted mannequin head circulating. Another year the tree was upside down, hung from the ceiling. Another it was Barbie dolls in different color liquids in bottles in the shape of a tree, too many to count, just extraordinary. The art behind the bar changes too, from unique artwork to unique mirrors and shapes. Every time I go the place has changed, I look forward to going sometimes just to see what has changed.\n\nAs with every review I always take the restrooms into account, think of it this way, if the public areas are unclean or not kept in a acceptable physical condition it begs the question, what do the areas the guest can't see look like, say the back of the house, specifically the kitchen. AZ 88's restrooms are always clean as a whistle. They are also some of the most unique I've seen. When going to restroom the wall is the door and only marked at the bottom of the door. The hand washing sinks have a window below, seeing through into the dining room. When you go, check them out, super cool.\n\n Seating is comfortable. The tables are just the right distance not to intrude upon each other. The long black couches recline, so if they are available, request them, after a few drinks you'll be thanking me. There is outdoor seating as well, though the tables do seem a bit closer together.\n\nAZ 88 takes music seriously here, or rather the 'audio architecture' as I like to call it. There is a DJ booth above with an experienced DJ spinning everything from acid jazz to 80s, rock to blues, and it all works. Its nice to see (or rather hear) that the owners understand that good background music stimulates conversation and adds to the experience. The volume is always at the perfect level, to listen or have a conversation without screaming. \n\nSince AZ 88 opened many other bars have opened in Scottsdale, no matter how many bars open around it, AZ 88 will always be a prime place for a late night bite, a drink or just a night out people watchin", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 7, "cool": 6}}, {"text": "Whenever I'm back in the Valley for a visit I try to make it to AZ88 with my girlfriends.

The menu boasts an impressive selection of chicken sandwiches, burgers, and salads - none of which will drain your bank account in these tough economic times. I am renowned for epic salad snobbery, but the Cobb here blew me away. Rich, deep-green leaf lettuce, thick slices of avocado,  grilled, seasoned chicken breast, and generous heaps of bacon and cream havarti (though you have the option of selecting one of nearly a dozen different cheeses). Try Elsa's Chicken Sandwich, even if you're not feeling particularly adventurous - the honey mustard sauce coupled with giant pecans and grilled bell pepper will blow your mind.\n\nI don't understand how anyone can afford to get sufficiently soused here, though - to make up for the entirely-too-affordable food, drinks really run the gamut. I soldiered the $9 bellini and, while suspiciously delicious, the alcohol content was questionable for its elevated price. I've heard rave reviews about the Summer Solstice and its ability to lube up your billfold as well. Aforementioned roommate dropped $120 on a slew of these suckers in a matter of hours. Fine if you've got enough money to drink away - otherwise, consider the possibility of car-barring.\n\nThe service here is unpredictable at best. I've had some patient, attentive (and handsome) servers; I've also had some cumbersome, inexperienced and perhaps unwittingly rude ones. On a Sunday night, we were made to wait through two of our server's smoke breaks before our check was delivered and our payment processed. Service is surprisingly slow, even on a Tuesday afternoon, so be prepared to be patient. \n\nAlso, the restrooms here are not for the self-conscious. If you've ever wanted to see what you look like in the loo from every possible direction, this is your place - faceted mirrors dominate wall space from floor to ceiling, giving you absolutely no place to hide from yourself, at the most vulnerable of times. This, in addition to the borderline-outrageous cocktail prices, could really ruin your night.

They had a chocolate tart that was pretty amazing, the highlight of my evening.  I might go there again just for that.

The cocktails are great (and strong) as well, but food is definitely center stage here. \n\nThey have an au poivre burger that is amazing. As soon as I read the description, I just had to have it. It's a 1/2 pound burger with a peppercorn crust (not sure if I remember if it's grilled or not) with a caramelized onion red wine reduction. I ordered the version that also added blue cheese and bacon - great burger classics. For some reason medium-rare burgers usually come to you almost well done at most places. Not here; the burger was cooked perfectly and was super juice. The flavor combinations were perfect and I couldn't put it down. The burger was accompanied by great waffle fries. Waffle fries are the best choice - crispy and crunchy. \n\nAnother favorite is the chicken-bacon club. OK, so you probably think, \"What can be so special about a club sandwich?\" This club was well thought out and should set the standard for all club sandwiches. First, the bread is thin and lightly toasted so as not to tear your mouth apart as well as providing a better balance to the other ingredients. The chicken was fresh cooked breasts sliced, layered with amazing smoky thick-cut bacon, just the right amount of lettuce, tomato, and cucumber (yes, cucumber). They also slice the sandwich in half (not quarters). So smart as it totally helps keeping the sandwich together when you eat it. \n\nThe decor is very cool as well. The restaurant is one big room with soaring ceiling. The entire front is constructed of all glass and steel and the great bar runs the entire side wall. The interior of the room itself is has lots of mirrors and eclectic decor but feels trendy, modern, and now. They also have a very cool front patio to enjoy when it's not too hot. \n\nI can't wait to eat my way through the menu.

AZ 88 is not in Mesa (anyone from Arizona would find that assumption laughable) but it is in Scottsdale, which is only a short drive from our parent's East Mesa abodes.\n\nWe parked in a lot in Old Town and walked the short distance (though kind of tucked away) to AZ 88.  The bouncer at the door looked...classy...I think that's the best way to describe it.  Dressed in all black, including gloves and a coat.

Schizophrenic, much like the patrons. Lots of mirrors and sleek lines, but not IKEA modern... try Miami Vice modern. Seating is generally tight and uncomfortable, and it's loud as hell. The bathrooms certainly are infamous, being all unlabeled with semitransparent doors and shit.

Both times I've been there the d\u00e9cor was very minimalistic, though I am told that there is a change in themes every month or two. There is a decent sized patio in the front equipped with table sets and couches indicative of the lounge theme and inside you can find seats at the bar, table sets, couches, or the reclining booth benches that run the perimeter. The music was of the repetitive bass beat, techo-ish, club style.. and I know they have a DJ at least a few nights a week. It wasn't too bad, or overly loud.\n\nI've ate both times that I have been here and both times I have been impressed. The food was great, and the wait staff attentive. I'd definitely recommend the burgers if you're not into that whole \"meat is murder\" thing and want to venture away from the usual sushi or salads routine of Scottsdale. Another thing about the food is that it is quite reasonably priced and portions are huge. \n\nI stuck to the basics ordering up a Jameson on the rocks. For the $8 price tag I assumed I would receive a 3 oz rocks glass half filled with this sweet nectar of the Gods. To my surprise (and joy) what I received was a regular well tumbler glass filled to the brim... SCORE! Yes, they do have some pricey drinks ($12 - $14 martinis) but for the most part the drinks menu seemed to be reasonably priced. (Hey, If you want a $2 beer stick to your local dive) You get what you pay for and they obviously have to make up for the inexpensive food somewhere. \n\nThe location of AZ-88 is a bit off the beaten path which can be looked at two ways, either it's a pain to find (which I could understand) or a hidden gem. I'll go with the latter; at least there is plenty of parking in the near-by garage. The draw-back; the location is probably why I haven't been here on a Friday or Saturday night (yet).\n\nI've only been here on weeknights so I am hesitant to speak to the local talent level in attendance, but, I will.

I get sad when someone suggests we eat inside because the longer I'm in AZ the more I take full advantage of the gorgeous weather. To me, eating inside means missing out on the sunshine and breeze. The AZ 88 patio overlooks the Civic Center which is a hidden little gem in Old Town equipped with a library, center for performing arts, modern art museum and other restaurants and bars. The setup is crisply white with modern art and I could sit outside for hours sipping a signature cocktail and people watching on a Saturday afternoon. \n\nThe Vibe \n\nIncredible artwork? Yes. A live DJ? Yes. Crazy bathrooms? Yes. A vibe that can easily go from day to night? Yes. AZ 88 makes me feel like I'm in LA, but in a good way. The furniture and setup is a chill and modern vibe and equipped with couches, chairs and various types of seating. I can go there and sip some drinks at the bar, visit with a couple friends on lounge seating, or make it a night out with a group at the tables. The artwork alone can bring me to AZ 88. Every time I visit, a new artwork theme lines the walls and ceiling. One time I was there and paint brushes dipped in different colors were hanging from the ceiling. AZ 88 showcases incredible artists and it's like I'm eating in a modern art museum. And yes, you read right. I did mention the bathrooms. When you visit, check them out and report back what you think. \n\nThe Cocktails and Food \n\nOne time a friend made me order a Pim's Cup. Another time I sipped on a martini. And then there are the signature cocktails in between. The food is trendy comfort food like a grilled cheese with tomatoes and bacon inside or about six different signature chicken sandwiches to choose from. Those of you who know my reviews, know I like some good comfort food and while I should go for the salad...how can I resist something like a grilled cheese? The signature chicken sandwiches are some of my favorites. I particularly like the AZ 88 Chicken Sandwich: grilled in Buffalo sauce, and topped with sauteed celery and bleu cheese dressing and the Hot Pepper Chicken: marinated in lime juice, topped with grilled jalape\u00f1o peppers and honey. I'm also a sucker for the water chestnuts wrapped in thick bacon. \n\nSo whether I'm looking for an afternoon or evening hanging out on the patio, a place to go out for a nice dinner for two or a fun dinner before a night out on the town with friends ...

That aside, the food is fantastic and even though it's a bit hard to get out of here for under $30 per person (because you simply must try the cheesecake, and drinks are pushing $14), it's worth it as a classy-but-casual night out that you can really enjoy.\n\nThey have a great patio, the burger is dripping with flavor (and, in fact, cheese), and they have waffle fries with pretty much everything.

But let me explain why I feel the need to write a love letter on yelp at 2 in the morning and why you should still care especially since you never worked there.  \nFOOD:\nIt's simple and delicious.  This is the 10 dollar burger that you wish you would have bought 2 of just to take 1 home.  At least 8 different cheeses to choose from, or do the combo 4 cheeses, add grilled onion, lettuce, tomato, and maybe some Nueske's bacon (ask for it extra crispy).  BLAMMO.  You will try to replicate it at home but it will never work. It is the best burger I've ever had and I was born and raised in Nebraska.\nAnd it's not just the burgers, the chicken sandwiches, the salads and the apps are all great.  And keep in mind I've seen all of this made, It's not that it's just great food, it's that it's all done in an impeccably clean kitchen with a great cooks that care about what they're doing. I have never seen such a consistent kitchen staff as I have at AZ, come in at 7 pm or call in an order at 12:29am and the food will always be good.\nBAR:\nHoly Moly I don't even know where to start.  I've been in this industry for 15 years and I've never seen a bar staff put out such a quality product in such a small amount of time.  AZ has the most delicious drinks that for the most part are all concocted in pint glasses, shaken and poured into rather large martini glasses with ingredients that include, but are not limited to; fresh cucumber and mint, hand squeezed juices, fresh sweet and sour, orange juice ice cubes, cherries that aren't soaked in formaldehyde, and an arrange of spirits so broad that first time patrons usually walk in with their mouths agape.  But what would booze be without someone to serve it to you? Sit at the bar and get to know your tender; good stories, great cocktails, and handsome men in ties.\nWAITSTAFF:\nAgain I know I'm biased, but this is one hell of a waitstaff.  Be it gluten free, dairy free, or basically any allergy, and this staff can handle the order.  They know all of the ingredients and are able to special prep things for you even on the busiest of Saturday nights.  The best part is they will make it look easy (I clocked 6 miles on my pedometer 1 Saturday night). \nWhen it comes to attitude don't be fazed by the \"Scottsdale idea\" of AZ.  I have never met a more down to earth group of people in my life.  They will remember you, what table you like to sit at, the Malbec you like with your burger and the name of that song you want the DJ to play.  Again, get to know your server, they will surprise you.\nAMBIANCE:\nThis review is already way too long so I will just say that the surroundings are ever changing, and it's kind of like an really cool modern art museum that you can eat and drink in and spill on the floor and nobody will yell at you but who cares because you  wouldn't hear anyway because the music is the jams. But it is sooo beautiful; park, trees, statues, giant patio lights, glass house, crazy xmas trees, etc. etc. etc.\nSHOUTOUT:\nAlso, let me just say, that none of this would be possible without an amazing owner that cares about his patrons just as much as his staff.  Which, in turn, provides a great and caring management.  And then becomes a solid team of people that actually give a shit.\nTo the best crew I've ever worked with.

It rose nearly a half inch above the rim of the flute and never spilled a drop over the side. It was brilliant. \n\nOne does not simply listen to \"Celebration\" without singing along and dancing.

My husband did NOT like the hamburger.  We specifically told the waitress before hand to make sure it was medium rare and NOT medium.  She wrote it down and sure enough the burger was well done.

Took it as it was since it is clear that when the place is packed they can't seem to get custom orders right. But they were nice enough about the situation and were gracious when we complained.  My husband commented to me that he was not enjoying the burger-- not tasty he said (as in one of the other joints we go to which shall remain nameless).   After I ate the ceviche, I asked to taste the burger meat since he said the burger wasn't very good.  The hamburger meat tasted to me like the burger I used to get growing up in the luncheonette where they used frozen hamburger patties cooked on a flat grill.  i could swear these are frozen hamburger patties, but I could be wrong.

The outdoor seating is also comfortable, which was really, really nice to have after three 20 mile days. My poor, tired ass was thankful for those cushions. Thank you AZ88!\n\nThe service was very attentive and did not appear to judge us for the quantity of our celebratory consumption. May I recommend the Modern Presbyterian and the Bloody Mary? The mimosa was also good, but a tad on the small side. My friend and I spit one of their burgers, which are a half of a pound of meat, served with fruit, vegetables and a healthy dose of waffle fries. We thoroughly enjoyed every morsel and the burger was juicy and cooked perfectly. \n\nBeing a true Yelper (and just plain nosy), I inquired about what our neighbors had ordered. They were locals and had the bacon wrapped water chestnuts and a potato chip looking app with cream cheese and lox. They looked delicious, but I couldn't find room and there was shopping to be had.

Both of these places did good business and since they were changed to something else, neither have seen any sort of success. \n\nI used to love Downside Risk - I would go there with my father who was ill (terminal cancer) and have beer battered chicken and drinks. It's one of those places that means something to me emotionally. So going to the former Famous Door strikes a chord. Seeing the joint (whatever it is now) empty on a Friday night is just sand kicked in the face since they might as well have kept it as the Downside Risk. \n\nWith Lyte though, they seemed to be doing something right... Basically, they opened it up from the Famous Door days, and the place is now fairly clean and swanky. It seemed a little too \"Scottsdale\" to me - i.e. \"fancypants\" - but it's a nice spot. They have some nice comfy booths that would be fantastic for groups of friends and a large enough dance floor/mingling area. My only complaint would be that the booths and curtains should be darker - similar to Chez Nous - to pull in a bit more of an eclectic crowd rather than trying to attract the d-bag/botard scene.\n\nThe food was a mixture of fantastic and kinda bad.

Yes, all 112lbs of me and some of you will be surprised that I was not the instigator. I was NOT. \nYou know that look.... that certain \"sociopath\" type look that serial killers have; the eyes are set a little too close together and their head slightly resembles a loaf of bread, pinched in at the temples. Well that's this guy....annnnnnd all of his equally roided out homies. The experience was actually scary and I don't scare easily. \n\n\"Killer\" wasn't the only reason for the sour taste in my mouth. The place was a little campy/cheesy and not really in the way I like. I can't really put my finger on it but it just wasn't my thing. The service was slow but the place was packed to the gills with every ass clown on the planet, so I'll cut them some slack there. We wanted to eat but there was no place to sit, as any of the open tables had reserved signs on them. Oh........reallllly, bottle service anyone? LAME \nI'm not sure if that was the case or not, it just seemed douchey and try hard. Shocking\n\nI will say one thing. This experience and the few others that I've had leading up to it have made me come to terms with something very special. I don't belong here and by here I mean Scottsdale. Unless of course someone would like to take me to City Hall for a sexy steak dinner. That's my idea of a good time.

You can either find a way to drive to Flagstaff or cab it to the Lodge and be whisked away to the imaginary world of mountainside living. \n\nWhen the Lodge first opened, I was a little confused. Why would Scottsdale think they could pull off a lodge when it's 100 degrees so many months out of the year? Who would want to hang out in a lodge? Then, I walked into the lodge and I was immediately mesmerized but its charm. I don't care if its 50 or 120 degrees outside, there's something adorable about the Lodge and I visit time after time. It's cozy, cute, reasonably priced, full of good food and has a whole slew of games to choose from. \n\nIn the front room, groups can sit and watch the game on the big screen or catch up while they eat and drink. In the main area, visitors can stand around with the bar goers and be \"Scene\" for the night without being too scene. And if you are in the game mode, head back to the most lodgy room in the building where they have Big Buck Hunter, pool tables, darts, and other random games. And then they went and did something glorious. They added a patio to the Lodge so when the weather's nice, folks can sit outside and play Giant jenga or bags. I can hang out at the Lodge for hours and be content. \n\nThe food at the Lodge is actually good. It's the kind of food where I actually eat there when I haven't had too much too drink. You can't say that about many bars in Old Town. Have you tried the potato skins? They aren't your average skins. They are crunchy and you dip them in the cheese queso dip. To-do-for and you probably gain five pounds immediately following. The TLTA is a favorite as well. It's honey roasted turkey with a creamy aioli and fresh avocados on crispy bread. Their cottage cheese is some of the best out there because it's spicy but not really spicy and has red peppers in it. I also enjoy their chicken sandwiches, burgers and of course the sweet potato fries. \n\nThroughout the year, the Lodge will host a variety of events in their parking lot. I've been to a skateboarding one and a surfing one. Yes, surfing!

After my Dodgers lost at Chase Field, I got hungry and I didn't have a lot of time left before I had to head back to Los Angeles. I wanted to see a couple of the party scene areas. I found a couple of hot spots near my hotel which is like Club Town. I found the Lodge. \n\nI arrived around 9:30pm to a party scene. There were tons of cabs and lots of women ready to party like there was no tomorrow. Parking is quite difficult, but being an Angeleno, I used my car to drive just a couple blocks from my hotel. I did find a street parking spot and glad I did before it got too crowded. \n\nThe Lodge does ID checks and the guy was quite friendly and welcomed me. I walk in and it was filled with more women than guys. I just wanted to grab something to eat and drink, but WOW. I got extremely nervous especially when there are lots of women. I headed straight to the bar and got my favorite drink, Cape Cod ($5). Then I closed my tab and headed towards the dining area. \n\nI sat down in the nice lounge/dining area. I was greeted by Brittany. She was a gorgeous doll and fast on my service. When I ordered food, the one item that got my attention was the Sasquatch Burger ($16). It was like a burger but as for the buns, it was replaced with two Grilled cheese sandwiches on the top and bottom. I had to order the specialty. Brittany was on top of me when she passed by (That's what she said). I would point to her and she knew what drink I needed. I got two Cape Cods during my meal. My total was $28.50\n\nTen minutes later....I got this huge plate of potato fries and this humongous sandwich or burger. I couldn't even give this a classification. I had no idea how to eat it. Eat the grilled cheese sandwich top bun first, or slice into it. I mean, you would have to cut it down unless you have one big mouth. The Sasquatch burger was damn amazing. You'll have to look at the photos that other Yelpers posted. I did finish by the way. I left the crust of the Texas Bread out because after all that drinking, I might have passed out from food coma and drinking :)\n\nAfter I was done, Brittany chatted with me and wished me safe travels back to Los Angeles. Again, she made sure I was OK before I left. I gave her a nice tip for checking up on me more than the other guests. That Sasquatch Burger was just overwhelming. I think I gained 5-6 lbs from it and with the multiple Cape Cods through the day, I am not even sure that I ate it.\n\nThe environment was quite clubby, but there was no fee to get in. There were a few military guys in there, but the ladies didn't even go for them. There were some older guys in there trying to be all arrogant and badass, but to me, they were just trying to impress the ladies. I miss this place already, but I am not sure my stomach wants to try the Sasquatch Burger very soon...Give me a year....\n\nThe Yelp Universe.

Also, the bathroom is really small and quiet, so if you're the only one in the bathroom, you're basically in there with the attendant just sitting outside of the stall listening and waiting for you to emerge.  It creeps me out, and I refuse to pay someone to hand me a paper towel.  No offense to the attendent, but I can do that myself for free, thank you.  \n\nAside from my rant about the bathroom attendant, I generally enjoy going to the Lodge, and I will continue to as long as I live around the corner from it.

Ordered mac and cheese as an appetizer and to my surprise it was tasty.  (I had asked the waitress if it was out of a box and she had said no).  It was nowhere near how good mine is, but it was good enough that I would order it again.  It had the back drop taste of some jalape\u00f1os that gave it a really good taste.  Ordered the fish sandwich with cheese and tartar sauce.  It was ample and freshly made.  Came with waffle fries which had to be re-fried because they were much too light in color--I hate when fries are not cooked enough.  They have to be brown and crispy--that's what fries are all about.  Hubby had the \"Smokey Burger\" without the cheese and sweet potato fries.  He had asked for it medium rare but it came out medium to medium well.  It is really hard for cooks to make a burger medium rare.  I think they are afraid that people will get sick.

There wasn't enough room to push two tables together in order to accommodate our party of 4, so we walked around the block until some tables were open.  The waitress was extremely nice and we were seated about 20 minutes later.\n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the avocado spring rolls and the roasted plantains.  Despite being small portions, they were both very good.  I was inspired to go get some plantains in the Asian market this morning in order to try to make them at home.\n\nAs an entree, I ordered the curried tofu again.  I wanted to try something else (the Ital soup or the veggie patty), but they were out of a vital component of each dish, and they don't make the soup in the summer.\n\nWhen my entree came out, I was initially really disappointed to see that they had made it with chicken, again.  I asked the waitress and she assured me that what I was seeing was actually a soy product and I had nothing to worry about.  I must say, it was disturbingly, uncomfortably meat-like.  So much so that I made my husband try it and tell me that it was in fact non-meat before I would put it in my mouth.  When I did eat it, it even had the texture of meat - very disconcerting.  The flavor was excellent, and I would definitely order this entree again - if I can get over the extremely realistic meat analog.  The sides were good (definitely better flavor since last time), especially mixed with the curry sauce.\n\nI have to issue a heartfelt apology to Wayne and The Breadfruit for the disparaging review that I wrote after my last visit.  I should have called to ask about the dish and had them clarify that my dish was, in fact, fake meat.  It has been so long since I ate chicken (and I don't generally eat fake meat), that I truly thought it was meat.  (Lesson:  Don't assume anything!)\n\nMy dinner companions all ordered a chicken dish, and all enjoyed them thoroughly.  I tried the festivals (breadstick) from someone's meal, and I have to say that Breadfruit should offer a basket of those as an appetizer.  Yum.\n\nWhen we were almost finished with our meal, the waitress brought us full sized samples of the carrot juice.  Another Yum!  It tasted a lot like Thai Iced tea - similar seasonings, and very rich and creamy.  \n\nI will definitely go back to Breadfruit.  The food was good (Festivals=crack), the atmosphere and the service is EXCELLENT, and it is close to home.  \n\nHome Run, Breadfruit.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDowntown Phoenix NEEDS a Jamaican restaurant (and an Ethiopian, Italian, Mexican, etc), and I have waited anxiously for Breadfruit to open - riding my bike by there every afternoon for weeks looking for any sign of life.  \n\nFinally, just this week, I see people eating there.  So, we went for lunch today ( at 12:45... at the end of the lunch rush), of course, we arrived at the exact same moment  as Phil Gordon.   I think we threw them off a little bit by ordering our meal to go, but they don't get a by for that.\n\nThe wait was long (35 minutes), but they were really busy, and they just opened, and the mayor was there, so it was understandable.  We forgave.  The lone waiter brought me a Fiji water, It tided me over slightly.\n\nI was excited to see several \"vegan\" options on the menu - mostly sides, but it looks like some of the entrees can be modified to fit vegetarian requirements.  \n\nI ordered the curried tofu (that is the name printed on the menu, no modifications!), which comes with sides of steamed plantains, beans/rice, and steamed cabbage/green bell peppers.\n\nUnfortunately, I recieved curried chicken, a fact that I discovered after getting back to my office... and I was WAY too starving to go back to get it fixed.  I ate around the chicken, something I am normally loathe to do... but as I said, STARVING.\n\nThe beans and rice = bland.  Nothing spectacular, they were just that: beans and rice.\n\nPlantains = undercooked.  Just slightly.  I wanted them to be so much better than they were.\n\nCabbage/Green Bell pepper = boring.  They were just steamed cabbage and green pepper.  I love cooked cabbage, but with salt please!\n\nNothing that I ate was seasoned at all.  I had bite or two of the curry sauce since it was touching the rice (starving!), and it tasted ok... am I allowed to pass judgement on a sauce that was poured over something I don't ever eat (because I think it is disgusting)?  Its hard to say.\n\nAdmittedly, I would have enjoyed this meal A LOT more if I had recieved a meal that did not contain meat.  \n\nI will probably go back... Breadfruit is new, and they deserve another chance.  I will definitely eat in, and I will try David's reccomendation of the avocado rolls.\n\nOne strike.

It remained tender and juicy throughout, except for the masterfully charred ends that added a slight smokiness to the entire dish.  \n\nBut lets back up a second.\n\nThe space itself is brilliant in its simplicity.  The walls are lime and slate gray with classy darkwood furniture.  The glassed walls look out onto the stoic skyline of downtown Phoenix and onto the hidden pave of Pierce, an homage to side-street gems that one would find in cities like NY, SF, and Seattle. \n\nIt is comfortable and cozy inside, with exposure to the cuisine sharks tending the kitchen.  At all times, there is activity, but just enough so that you feel the life of the kitchen spill out onto the dining area.  I love restaurants that pull this off.\n\nFor an app, we started with an order of the Curry Chicken Patty.  It was sensational.  Within the pastry was a harmonious balance of chicken to curry with a noticeable, but slight burn throughout.  Two came in an order, which must be shared with a partner because two pre-meal would fill you up too heavily.\n\nWhen the grilled jerk chicken was presented, it was glorious because you find the Caribbean influences presented on the dish; a white wine vinegar drizzled slaw, roasted pineapple, and a succulent, savory corncob.  Where the chicken is the heart of the meal, the corn was the soul.  Paired together, I couldn't have been more delighted.\n\nTo drink, we had the D&G Spicy Ginger Beer imported from Jamaica.  Erm, I typically like Ginger Beer, but this one was branded as spicy and they f'ing mean it.  Be careful that you are prepared for spice-on-spice if you order it.  Looking back, i probably should have stuck with water, although the Ginger Beer was rudimentary for palate preservation as you meander through all of the various flavors of this cuisine.  Honestly, I cannot wait to go here to grab a Guinness (a Jamaican staple according to Zane Lamprey) or a Red Stripe.  The surging spiciness demands a brew that could handle this oral development.\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased Breadfruit braved the Great Menace that is downtown development.

I'm now a firm believer that downtown Phoenix is on the comeback trail.

Its kind of hidden behind condos just one block south of Matt's.  But boy what a find.\n\nWhen you walk in, you get that trendy modern industrial feel of a loft you might see in the downtown neighborhood.  The ambience and music are pretty cool all in all.  Our waitress was extremely friendly and flexible as we tried to split tabs multiple ways (she earned a nice tip from us for her efforts).  I'd never had Jamaician or what they call \"East Indie\" food before so I had no preconceived notions about what I was going to eat.  I had their signature dish, the jerk chicken with coleslaw corn and coco bread.  Talk about spicy chicken!  My mouth was on fire, but full of flavor too.  The side dishes were good, but nothing special.  I had a delicious pineapple soda to wash it down so that helped my burning palate.  For dessert I had the grapenut icecream topped with cherry jello.  An unusual dish to be sure, but it was definitely tasty.\n\nPerhaps what makes this place most popular is the fact that this restaurant is very vegetarian friendly.  Along with a fruit salad medley, they have a curried tofu dish and a vegan italian soup.  About half of the folks I was with had the vegetarian friendly dishes and raved about them.  I was the only one brave enough to try the ice cream, but I promise its nothing scary.\n\nNow this place isn't perfect and here's a couple of reasons why (in my opinion):  (1) no reservations and the place is small so probably want to get there right when they open for lunch or dinner, (2) as mentioned above, the side dishes were okay but nothing out of this world, (3) if you really pressure them, they might be able to break out separate checks but as a general rule they typically don't split tabs.\n\nAll in all, it was a good meal for a reasonable price.  Its great to see establishments like this pop up downtown and hopefully local patrons will continue to keep businesses like this one going.

They only have street parking. We got there around 5 or 6, and the waitress said we were the first people there all day. One other group of people eventually showed up. For dinner, we had the plantain avocado spring roll with seasonal chutney. No complaints here - a good appetizer and the chutney was delicious. I then had the coco bread & pattie sandwich - okay, this was weird. The \"pattie\" looks like a combination of an empanada and a Hot Pocket which they put between two slices of delicious coco bread.

As I was walking away, a lady opened the door and let me know they opened for lunch at noon, showed me the menu and suggested the jerk chicken, since I'd not had Jamaican food before.

I had the ginger beer and it's hellavalotta ginger (it was way strong). Rob had the cola champagne which was like cream soda. Rob ordered the jerk chicken and I ordered the curried chicken and dumpling. Since the jerk chicken was going to take 15 minutes, we started out with a spicy beef pattie and a chicken curry pattie. I started with half of the beef and it was good spicy, but the chicken was amazing. I could mack on those all day long. Our entrees arrived and we dug in. My dish was very flavorful and the recommendation of the server was to eat the dumpling with the sauce. Good idea, since the dumpling itself doesn't have a very defined flavor and it particularly dense. (If you're thinking granny's chicken and dumplings, this isn't it.) The jerk chicken was so spicy that Rob couldn't finish it. He did find that eating it with a bite of pineapple helped to cut the heat, but it was still Hades hot. Apparently, if you order the carrot juice with this dish, it counters the atomic heat. Seriously, Rob can handle spicy but this was perhaps too much.\n\nOverall, it was a good experience. There were a handful of other diners there at 12:30 when we arrived and people were coming throughout our meal.

Then I found out that unfortunately the food only kind of delivers on the menu's promise. \n\nThings I ate:\n\nAvocado Plantain Spring Rolls with Mango Chutney -  Meh. A little dry. A lot boring. Very disappointing. These could be amazing with a little effort.\n\nEscovich Fish and Festival: The fish was actually very good. So was the sweet bread thing that came with it. I wish there was a little something else though...felt like it was missing something.\n\nCurried Chicken and Dumpling: Is this a dumpling or a ROCK? Seriously - the dumpling was kind of like a hockey puck, but I admit it was kind of a tasty hockey puck so I'm conflicted on this one. The chicken and veggies were good and the plantains were awesome. The cooked cabbage was a little undercooked and I am pretty much turning into my grandmother (a little old Russian lady) so I like my cabbage prepared just right, please.\n\nGret's Grapenut Ice Cream and Jello: HOLY CRAP THIS IS GOOD. Seriously, you have to try this dessert. It rocks socks.\n\nOkay, now I'm beginning to think  The Breadfruit really does deserve four stars.

In all honesty, it is difficult to try new places when all of the new places are only open for lunch and I don't get home until 4pm. That is why we were pleased to see a new place, right down the street, opening up and actually staying open until 8.\n\nThe Breadfruit is the work of Dwayne Allen. As far as I can tell, he is a nobody in the restaurant scene which is a nice change of pace for some of the places that are going in downtown. The space is quite inviting. Small open lofty area for dining with seating for about 24 people inside. Bright green walls and faux-brick interior brightened the area up and contrasted the exposed ducts. I felt like I was at home. There were two tables set up outside as well providing an inviting option in the cooler months but the local foot traffic was a little sketch.\n\nThe menu is different. There are words that you recognize surrounded by words that you don't making ordering a bit difficult. Most likely, you will go with the word you know and order based on that. My party seemed to have done just that.\n\nAfter a lengthy wait to place and receive our order, our table was full of food.\n\nPlantain avocado spring roll with seasonal chutney - this overpriced appetizer was a terrible mess of mushy vegetables warmed inside a pastry and layered with mashed mandarin oranges. The group enjoyed; I was less than impressed and greatly disgusted at the contrast of hot and cold on the plate.\n\nEscovitch Fish and Festival - Friend got this. She seemed to enjoy it, not finding it to be nearly as spicy as it was made out to seem. The fish seemed like it was cooked well and the escovitch sause was excellent.\n\nBrown Stew Chicken - Friend got this. He seemed to find it to be skimpy. Compared to some of the other dishes, the meat was significantly less existent. There were also some bones in the chicken.\n\nJerk Shrimp - Wife got this. She thought it was good but was suffering from the spice. She is not one to eat spicy food and this was too hot for her. The shrimp were cooked well and had a bit of crisp to them. Also, the tails were removed which earned them big bonus points in my book.\n\nJerk Chicken off the Grill - Mine. If ever a dam breaks and floods downtown Phoenix, I know that we will be safe. The chicken at Zoe's Cafe and The Breadfruit will save our home by absorbing the water. I couldn't imagine drier chicken than at Zoe's before last night but the jerk flavoring added to the bone dry chicken was the perfect storm to absorb any liquid from my body. Terrible, simply terrible. Realizing that the chicken wasn't spicy at all by my standards, I ordered up some more of that escovitch sauce and drenched by chicken in it whereby making it palatable. The chicken was surrounded by an over cooked pineapple slice that was hard and dry, a tiny piece of corn that had such small kernels on it that I actually had to use a knife to cut them off (something I hate). There was also a pile of ital coleslaw which was a combination of sticks and rubbish that traditionally makes it into the bin at most restaurants. Hard times call for desperate measures.\n\nDrinks did include a wonderful selection of \"Jamaican soda\". The ginger beer was great but very sugary. My wife tells me that the pineapple soda was a little strong and could have been a bit subdued. She also complained of the sugaryness of the sodas.\n\nIn all, Breadfruit is a welcome addition to the downtown neighborhood. I was not surrounded by dirty hippies with dreadlocks and the owners were good people. I would recommend that people try it once but I would never suggest it as a place to go for dinner.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the owner will harass you if you leave even slightly negative reviews of his place on Yelp.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 3, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "I'm with Tracy.

Ignore anyone on here who complains about the $5 corkage fee because the markup most restaurants put on a bottle of wine is well over five bucks (usually it's 2-3 times what they paid!).  Plus BYOB allows you to bring exactly what you want to complement your meal (I would suggest a dry riesling, gewurztraminer or an un-oaked chardonnay). \n\nThe menu is small but there were plenty of options, even for vegetarians! I would have happily eaten everything from the appetizers section, but my dining pals and I set our sights on the plaintain avocado spring roll that is baked, not fried! I thought it was a creamy slice of deliciousness, and the accompanying chutney did not disappoint. My main dish was the Bok Choy and Mashed Sweet Potato....alright I've spent about 5 minutes sitting here staring at the screen because I don't know how to describe how great my meal was. Here's an idea: YUM. oh my gosh it was delicious, each ingredient and seasoning was a perfect and direct complement to all the rest. It was filling too, I mean, bok choy and mashed potatoes, that sounds like two side dishes to a \"real\" meal, but this meal is the real deal.

The people in the kitchen and the waiter were friendly and greeted us on the way in and thanked us on the way out. \n\nWe ordered the sorel and some drink made with mangoes, mint and tea for drinks, the Jerk chicken and the Escovitch Fish and Festival for our entrees. We skipped the appetizers to save room for dessert. I like the sorel, but my wife thought it was too spicy for her tastes. It has a very strong ginger taste to it. We both liked the mango mint tea drink. The Jerk chicken was good. I didn't think it was too spicy at all. It definitely left a presence on the tongue, but nothing that was unbearable or really unexpected. The Escovitch fish was supposed to be spicy as well per the waiter, but it wasn't as spicy as he made it out to be. My wife really liked the bread sticks with the vanilla scent. We had the sweet potato bread pudding for dessert and had to order seconds. It has a nice crunchy coconut top which contrasts wonderfully with the soft inner bit. \n\nThe menu overall is limited, but I didn't think this was a problem.

So here goes...first review in Phoenix: The Breadfruit.\n\n- - - \n\nThe owner of the Breadfruit can tell you where the strawberries they use in their fresh made strawberry lemonade come from. And the answer isn't Costco.  \n\nI went in at kind of an odd time, 4:30 on a Saturday, after a day of apartment hunting downtown.  There was a duo and another solo diner both sitting inside. The server was friendly and offered great suggestions. The weather was perfect so I sat outside at one of the handful of tables on the sidewalk.  The curried chicken and dumpling were fantastic: served with grilled plantains that tastes more like a potato than fruit,  and fresh bell peppers. The dumpling was dense and went great with the curry sauce. Although the rice and peas that the server suggested were delicious, I think the entr\u00e9e could have stood on its own.\n\nThe server picked up on the fact that I was in no rush and she was friendly and attentive while not rushing me. A while later a guy who worked there came outside to eat his meal before the dinner crowd arrived.  We started talking about the book I was reading, Food Inc, and he told me about the restaurant's goals to provide thoughtful, local food. Turns out I was talking to Duane, the owner, and I was pleasantly surprised to hear him tell me the strawberries in my strawberry lemonade come from the farmer's market around the corner and were grown in Yuma. There aren't nearly enough business owners who care enough to invest the time and energy into such pursuits. We talked a little more about our common love for conscious eating and how meals should be experiences, not quick fixes to fill you up.  He explained that this is why his restaurant does not package anything to go. I can respect that. If you want their food you're going to eat it fresh and you're sure as hell not taking it home to microwave leftovers.\n\nA chef/businessman with values who eats his own meals, talks passionately about being involved in the growth of downtown and can tell you where his food comes from...I'm a fan.\n\nDid I mention the Sweet Potato Pudd'n and vanilla ice cream?

She could have told us that when we were seated, and shrimp comprises about half of their menu.  Duh?\n\nFood was good.  Not fantastic.  But solidly good.  The festival bread sticks were delicious.

He came out later in the meal, asked if I enjoyed it, and said that he worried it would be too \"fishy.\" Nice guy, btw.\n\nTheir scallop appetizer was well-cooked (nice jerk sear on the outside, almost gooey inside), but rather pricey (12.50). The jamaican spinach empanada was seasoned well and baked rather than fried, but wasn't anything to write home about.\n\nThe real highlight of the meal was the carrot juice and strawberry lemonade my partner and I ordered.

I first learned of The Breadfruit because they were sampling a strawberry lemonade at the PHX Public Market. That same night, as we were deciding where to go have dinner with a friend from out of town, I remembered and made the suggestion. It sounded good to everyone, so off we went to enjoy a Jamaican dinner.\n\nThe restaurant is small, with a tropical decor, just a few tables, and a pretty good view of the kitchen. The staff is very attentive, to the point of being pushy and persistent, but I'll get back to that in a second. First the food!\n\nDespite the server's insistence that we should try one of their fresh juices, we really didn't want to. No one in our party really drinks juice, and no one wanted an alcoholic beverage, so we all chose water. \n\nFor our appetizer, we all shared a plate of oven-roasted plantains. Very similar to Cuban/Puerto Rican fried sweet plantains, but possibly healthier, since they were roasted in the oven and not fried. They were delicious, and the plate had enough so that each of us got two plantains.\n\nFor dinner, two of us ordered the Jerk Chicken off the Grill and one of us had the Jerk Prawns. All of these dishes were accompanied by a fresh baked festival (Jamaican cornbread?), grilled pineapple, corn on the cobb, and a spicy cole slaw. I can't speak for anyone else, but my meal was delicious and the portion was just right. The jerk spice was perfect blend of sweet and spicy, and when things got too hot, a quick bite of grilled pineapple brought things back to a happy level. Truly enjoyed that dinner. \n\nMy husband, who got the prawns, was disappointed at the size of his portion, felt that he didn't get enough food, but enjoyed the meal nonetheless.\n\nBy the time we were done, there really wasn't room for dessert, though that didn't stop our server from ignoring us and insisting on leaving a dessert menu on our table. \n\nSo about that persistent server... It was nice at first, to have someone who is so enthusiastic about the food offered at The Breadfruit. She spoke passionately and animatedly about the process of selecting local and organic ingredients or all their dishes, and when we asked her about some of the entrees, she lit up and gave us great detail about each one. But then it took a turn toward Annoyinglandia. Fast. In addition to the information we wanted, she went on and on about the juices, and after we ordered our appetizer and entrees, she tried to upsell several sides to each of us, though we continued to tell her this was all we wanted. Our guest made the mistake of saying out loud that he was a bit dehydrated. Our server suddenly became a nutrition expert and proceeded to tell him how one of the best ways to \"dehydrate\" is to eat your hydration, and suggested various salads (hello! We just ordered full entrees!). In addition to the salad for hydration, she again insisted on bringing some of the carrot juice she mentioned earlier. Again, we declined, each time a little more obviously annoyed with her persistence. But she was not to be deterred. This same level of persistence and constant attempts to upsell other menu items, drinks and dessert continued, even after we had paid our bill and were walking out the door. \n\nThe meal was great, but the dining experience would have been a lot more enjoyable had the server listened to us, respected our choices, and other than to check on us for water and such, had left us to enjoy our meals in the company of our guest. The three of us felt her persistence was more \"pestering\" than \"good customer service\" and that was very unfortunate. \n\nWith regard to the bill - it was around $50 including a 20% tip - keep in mind that we had no sides, no drinks and shared ONE appetizer between the three of us. Considering that everything is made from scratch and great care goes into selecting the ingredients, I'm happy to pay a little more for chicken, corn on the cob and cornbread once in a while.\n\nWould I eat here again? If someone else invites me to go, yes, but I probably won't be hurrying back, despite the food being very good.

I couldn't wait to try them.  I love avocado and they sounded amazing.  For the price ($7.50, I think) you only get two eggrolls cut in half.  I thought that was a bit pricey.  They were a huge disappointment.. Plantains are a bit mushy and bland as a rule and so are avocados.  So together you got a bland, mushy eggroll wrapped in a flavorless wonton wrapping.  It came with a mango puress dipping sauce which was sweet but not very flavorful and mushy.  lol\n\nFor dinner I had the coconut curry tofu.

We enjoy good food and supporting local. The option to pick up wine at the Public Market next door and have the already reasonable corkage fee waived was a bonus, as we had really enjoyed a couple of the Arizona Stronghold wines at a recent FnB wine pairing and thought they would pair well with the Jamaican heat! \n\nWhile the scallops were delicious and cooked perfectly, 2 for $12.50 -- $6.25 per scallop -- is a tad steep in my book.

I'm more than biased.\n\nI was hungry. My hunny was hungry.  We were hot and tired of fast food.  So we decided to trek via the steel horse to this quaint restaurant.\nDecorum: \nDecorum: paint job was nice.  Yellow and green walls. Pictures of Jamaican food.  Local art.  Jamaican paintings.  Nice candles. Small tables,  Nice environment for couples.  Tables outside.  No one was outside because it was hot ass 99 degree hell.  \n Bob Marley, is what I sang along to while I waited patiently for my food.  We held our breathe.  This is Phoenix after all.

And he was err um not Black.\nTHE FOOD:  I ordered they brown stew chicken, with rice and peas and huge heep of cabbage. Never had it prepared that way.  Never want to eat a huge slimy hard to cut heap of cabbage again.  Try shredding it, please. One red and one green pepper slice.  And to my dismay two puny slices of plantains.

The rice and peas tasted like Indian rice.  It looked like Indian rice.  In fact it was Indian bismati rice.  The chef told me himself. Jamaicans dont eat bismati rice.  Its too expensive. They eat white rice with beans.  I was confused, but i was hungry and i did eat it.  \nNo ginger beer available.  But the carrot juice was not so bad.

I ended up going all in with the chiles.  Yum city!\n\nI definitely want to go back and try some of the spicier food & have a cocktail as well.  It seemed like they have a small, but great selection of fresh juices and tasty rums to go well with the cuisine.\n\nAs a side note for anyone looking to go here.  It's in a great little spot of PHX, surrounded by other restaurants, and it is close to the light rail (for the lucky few who happen to live off that awesome 17-mile stretch of public transportation).  If you go, note that the place is tiny!!!

What a great little gem in Phoenix. The lady of the house and I went , as I'd been following the place on Yelp, and seeing the great reviews in the local papers. \n\nI'm familiar with Island food, having spent my high school years in Florida during a period of much emigration from Haiti, Jamaica, and the other islands. It was a real pleasure to see the classics presented in a modern setting. \n\nThe Breadfruit just got their liquor license! Normally, we don't start with cocktails, but the drinks menu looked amazing. I chose My Favorite Carrot Juice, which is made with carrot juice, coconut milk, vanilla and more. Loved it. The lady had the Sorrel, and later the Pink Ting. She loved it. \n\nWe started with their perfect Appleton Rum Sea Scallops and a Spinach Patty. The scallops were cooked just right and were on the money with regard to spice. The spinach patty is such a basic thing, really delicate with some unexpected savory taste. \n\nShe had Curried Chicken and Dumpling. Superb. The whole wheat dumpling was unexpected and had a thick bit to it. The go-alongs were cabbage, green banana, and plantains. I got to taste most of it and found it to be  perfect island comfort food. \n\nI had the Estovich Fish and Festival. Tonight's fish was red snapper, which I love. They used their Jerk rub to heat it up and put the Estovich on the side. Good move, as you can heat it up Scotch Bonnet-style, as much as you'd like. This came with grilled pineapple, coleslaw, and one festival. Said corn on the menu, but it never came. \n\nService was superb. Our server, Jason, asked if it was our first time and where we'd heard of them. When I said \"Yelp\", he quickly jotted this on the order pad.

That was not the case here but it was a darn righ better that I could have whipped up in my kitchen at home. I think most americans will probably enjoy it but I will wait until I am back home or at a greasy spoon in Brooklyn or one of the many Florida cities with large jamaican communities.

We were offered menus to peruse while we waited about 10 minutes for a table.\n\nInside, we ordered two mixed drinks (a mojito vanilla for me). They were strong and very good. The mojito was very minty and refreshing and my mojito-loving friend said he should have ordered a mojito. (Read: Get a mojito.)\n\nThe Food: We split a tilapia patty (very spicy!) for an appetizer. (Patties are Jamaican empanadas.) \nI had the coconut curried tofu with rice and peas, ripe plantains, and veggies. This is the one of the best tofu dishes I have ever had. My only complaint is that Breadfruit needs to have more plantains per plate. They are so good!\nOne friend had the curried chicken and dumpling with a green banana, veggies, plantains, and a side order of rice and peas. Although he didn't like the whole wheat dumpling, he loved the curry sauce and the green banana. He called the sauce \"delectable.\" \n\nOverall, this is a great place. Small, but great. The drinks are strong, the food is great, and the serve is prompt.

Oh well, I'm putting it out their now, bring change to feed the meters.\n\nI have mixed feelings on the Breadfruit and I'll explain, the food, which was good, I enjoyed it and did eat it, I think is little overpriced, for example the pineapple upsidedown cake I order, that was maybe 4 bites was 9.50, that was more than my pina colada, come on now, maybe they want you to drink to forget the prices lol. Also people were saying the size of the entr\u00e9e dishes were small, but for me it was perfect, I think it's because we are so used to our plates being full of food that we forget what the right portion of food is. But because of the price, I am rating it 3 stars for now.\n\nThere were mussels for everyone to enjoy, and if you are seafood person I bet they would have been for you! I did try one, the broth was delish!

Ok if you never had an avocado cooked, then it would throw your taste buds for loop, but for me this little appetizer was good, and the mango chutney was a perfect paring! Didn't disappoint!\n\nI ordered the Jerk Chicken off the grill, I have been craving jerk chicken forever, and this came with a slaw of sorts, mango chutney, grilled pineapple and a corn on the cobb that tasted like it was glazed in coconut, omg so good, I wish all corn on the cobb was like that! The jerk chicken had great flavor and kick! My taste buds were jumping! I cut up a little piece and paired it with a piece of grilled pineapple & mango chutney and it was party time! Like eyes rolling back good! Man that was great!  The little bread stick was a nice treat too, little bit on the sweet side, enjoyed it.  That was a perfect dish! I would come back for that!\n\nOk so I wound up ordering desert, which is something I rarely do, but I was sold on the description of pineapple upside cake, I love that stuff!!!

If it was everything that had been described to me, I think I would have been ok with the price, but the cake was dry, not as moist as I like it, it had few pineapples on it, and the glazed was only on the corner of the cake, but that glazed was good.

It did have the smokey flavor and the broth that was left was good for dipping the bread in. Good eats.\n\nI next ordered the oven roasted plantains for my appetizer, which were very good, however I received 6 slices and it cost  $5.00 or roughly $1.20 per slice. Plantains themselves before cooking  are a decent size however  the slices I received were just a normal small slice you would get at any restaurant that has them as an appetizer. I have had plantains at other places and received much more and the cost was much less.\n\nFor my main course, I ordered Scallops. You receive 4 average size scallops and a side of rice and peas. The scallops were good but I am not sure that they were $22 good. Maybe $16.50. They were nice and spicy and they did melt in your mouth but other than that, there was nothing extra special about them. \n\nSome people ordered dessert and I knew that it was going to be bad.

Since I couldn't decide between that or the jerk, I had to come back a couple nights later to try the free range jerk chicken, which was savory and spicy. Both meals were exceptional, and my only regret was that I wasn't in Phoenix longer to try some other dishes. The meals ranged between $14 and $24. Now, back to the rum bar. The bar staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. During my two visits, I tried several of the cocktails and was not disappointed with any. Each drink was made with fresh ingredients and with a variety of rums. You'll not find Captain Morgan or Bacardi here; rather, rums from the Caribbean and Central America dominate, and they even have a rum from Tennessee with a bit of a bourbon taste. You'll also not find whiskey or vodka, just rum, Red Stripe, and wine. They offer some rum flights at a reasonable price, and it's a great opportunity to try different brands of rum and different ages. The owner and bartenders will tell you anything you want to know about the various rums--I felt like I should have been taking notes. I cannot recommend The Breadfruit highly enough and will definitely return again on my next visit to Phoenix.

We went in, had no wait (it was like 9 pm or so) and were seated in the tiny dining room. The menu had some interesting looking items on it (the drink menu looked good too, but being that I had been drinking all night at the Yelp event, I figured I didn't need to pay 9$ for a drink....). I asked the waitress what soup they had, and she said they didn't have soup that day (and in a tone that was like...'you idiot' I think because the soup says Saturday soup or something, but I figured if it was on the regular everyday menu and not a specials menu it was probably just a name for the soup....maybe it was stupid....I don't know). So I asked for my second choice, the chicken and dumplings....oh sorry, we're out of that. ohhhhhhk. So I asked what she would get and she went on and on about the prawns. I told her I wasn't into seafood, so what did she suggest that was not seafood and she replied \"Have you ever had prawns?!?!\" Really? Not the expected response from a waitress....I have had prawns, I do not like them or most any seafood and I do not want an inflated check for food that I do not want because your restaurant is out of everything else. She then suggested the salad with chicken in it, so I got that. My friend got the chicken sandwich. She said the sandwich was good...my salad was terrible. We both concurred it was one of the worst salads I have had. The dressing tasted like orange rinds and was super sweet and the chicken in it was very spicy (which I like) but the two flavors together were not complimentary. Also, the salad was drenched in that dressing....no eating around it. The veggies seemed fresh enough and it looked nice, but for 10$ it is absolutely not worth it. I got a to go box and left it by the light rail so a homeless person could try to eat it, although I think they may even leave it behind.

We are all working professional women who are accustomed to fine dining and good service, but unfortunately, we got none of that at The Breadfruit. \n\nOur waitress tried to push the most expensive thing on the menu multiple times, despite my friends saying they don't like seafood. She then tried to push everyone to order sides of rice and peas (I really wonder if they make a commission from selling rice and peas), and also suggested that my friend order some for her 1-year-old son. My friend went ahead and ordered it because she figured he could nibble on it if he wanted, and it wouldn't be a big waste of money if he didn't like it or wasn't hungry. More on this later...\n\nAnother friend asked the waitress if she could get her meal without anything banana-related on the plate, because she has a banana aversion. The waitress extremely rudely replied \"The menu SAYS right THERE that no substitutions are allowed. And they AREN'T bananas - they're plantains.\" My friend stated that she couldn't eat either bananas or plantains, and that she wasn't asking for a substitution, but rather the omission of the plantains from the plate. The waitress stated that it could not be done, because it would ruin the presentation of the dish, so I just piped up and told my friend I would take her plantains off the plate. \n\nNow back to the rice and peas. When the 1-year-old started eating it, he spilled some of it onto the table, and then wiped what he had spilled from the table onto the floor (he's a 1-year-old, after all! He hadn't made a peep the entire time we were there, nor did he ever try to get down from his adult-sized chair, so pushing some rice onto the floor was not a huge transgression). The waitress immediately came over and said, in the rudest voice ever, \"Oh that's just GREAT. Can you just NOT let him do that???\" to which my friend replied, \"Don't you have a broom? I will clean it up.\" The waitress just rolled her eyes and disappeared (but never did bring a broom). My friends and I are generous tippers, and would have rewarded the waitress greatly for dealing with the aftermath of a toddler's dinner.

We asked the other waiter to speak to a manager, and after about 5 minutes (during which time our waitress never did reappear), the manager finally came over and spoke to us. He told us that the waiter would be serving us for the rest of our dinner, instead of the waitress, but he never did apologize for his employee's rude behavior. \n\nI see from other Yelp reviews that others have had similar experiences with that waitress, and I question if she is still employed solely based on her scallop- and rice-and-pea- upselling abilities.

Only after they confirmed we'd be ordering alcohol in addition to our meals of course. \n\nupon arriving we realized we had the whole patio to ourselves and if we pushed the tables together we would all be able to fit comfortably together with room for another table on the patio should they have more diners. \n\nwe asked if we could push our tables together and they were very snotty telling us we were basically lucky that they even agreed to accommodate us to begin with and the set up they created was our only option. we should bow down and kiss their feet for taking us at all. \n\nlike seriously?! you can't make any exceptions?! it would be one thing for us to suck it up if it clearly wasn't possible but it was totally possible for us all to sit together without changing a dang thing to the outside set up. it doesn't change anything!!!  our group could have sat together for crying out loud. it was totally possible. so stubborn and rude. \n\nso that really set the mood for all of us. if we thought someplace nearby could accommodate a group of 10 last minute we would have pimp walked outta there. \n\nbut we endured it, tried to get past it for the sake of the meal and enjoyed all of their tasty drinks and the food was good. i loved their pina colada redux. the spring rolls were super boring flavor wise and left me thinking \"what the heck, yelpers?! why did so many people recommend this?\". my jerk chicken was tasty. \n\nabout 95% of our group smokes so after the meal they went to the back area to have a smoke(it sounded like they had a nice area just for this). the servers chased everyone down in the smoking area and tried handing them the bill while they were back there enjoying themselves making things really weird. \n\nwhile the majority of the group was in the back smoking area they served me a free birthday dessert which was awkward bc shouldn't you do that when the whole party is around? they knew most of my party was out back seeing as how they chased them down with the checks. i blew out the candle and the few of us sitting there tasted it. it was one of the grossest things ever so thankfully it was free. it was a really sweet gesture though (but just fyi...dont order the potato dessert pie or whatever its called. better known as barf pie. i totally understand why they give that one away for free. no one would pay for that. just saying). but still, really kind birthday gesture. *ok, after reading some other reviews you people are loving this sweet potato pie. i am officially convinced they served us a rotten piece on purpose*\n\nthey don't usually let people split the check (we noticed this printed at the bottom of the menu) but our nice server offered to let us... only he made us divide everything up for him. i mean, isn't that his job? i get that it isn't normally allowed but he offered and it would have been really nice for him to divide it up for us. plus the restaurant was not busy and we spent a lot of money on food and drinks. it's the least they could have done but they apparently hate accommodating customers or providing an enjoyable dining experience for larger groups. this behavior would be acceptable at applebees or something. ugh whatever we were just so ready to get the heck out of there bc we were so clearly not welcome.\n\ni def won't be back and i know most of my party will not be back based on this experience. \n\nthis place really is only good for super small, intimate settings. i wouldn't recommend going here with more than 4 people. they make it known that they don't really want you there if there are more than 4 of you anyway so be prepared to have a horrible time if you're with a group.\n\nAlso, you can't even order breadfruit at the breadfruit.", "review_stars": 1, "review_votes": {"funny": 4, "useful": 15, "cool": 4}}, {"text": "The best restaurant in Phoenix/ One of the best restaurants in the country.

The server approached our table with a mouthful of the day's special selection and a great grasp of the menu, very impressive so we ordered Admiral's Punch and some starters: She had the Roasted Plantains with Chutney dip and I had the Baked Mango Fish Rolls. The plantains were soft not crisp and void of flavor as for my fish rolls they were pretty good but the fish was over cooked. The drinks were a bit weak until we added shots of Wray&Nephew. \n\nSo as we sat sipping, a man stopped by our table and asked if we were enjoying our food, we looked at each other and she asked why jerk wings weren't served on the starter menu. The islander became very defensive explaining \"his island eats the whole bird not just part of it\", my girlfriend rebutted, having spent a lot of time in Jamaica feasting on local island cuisine as well as falling in love with the jerk wings!

Sweet Pea and I were early Breadfruit adopters, back when there weren't dozens of great restaurants downtown, back when it was a tiny place with no liquor license where you could BYOB, sit with 10 or so other people, and watch one guy cook your dinner.  Breadfruit has changed a lot, and not for the better.\n\nI suggested Breadfruit for dinner before an event because we hadn't been there in a year at least, and Sweet Pea loves the Jerk Chicken, and I love the Coconut Curried Tofu.  So we get there, and like 3 separate people asked us if we have a reservation.  It hadn't even occurred to me to make a reservation for 6pm, even on a Saturday night, but the place was full.  After they told us that it will either be an HOUR for a table, or we can sit at the bar, we decided to sit at the bar since our event started at 7:30pm, and I generally don't mind eating at the bar anyway.  Unfortunately we ended up with me sitting on the end by the service well so it was sub-optimal.  Also, when I picked up the drink menu, there was a dead moth underneath that I had to brush away.\n\nThe bartender poured us some waters and asked us if we've been there, and we said yes.  Then Sweet Pea ordered a Dark and Stormy, which is a very typical rum drink, this being a rum bar and all.  The bartender says \"uh, we like to keep it on-menu...have you been here before?\"  AWKWARD.  No, we were lying.  We explained that we had, but that it had been awhile, and then we felt like crap.  After all the \"do you have reservations\" inquiries and now this, we felt unwelcome and out of place.  Rearding the Dark and Stormy, ever since they opened Rum Bar, they've been all uppity about their rum drink menu.  I have been there and tried to order a rum and diet and been smacked down hard because G-d forbid they serve such a pollutant as DIET COKE with their beloved rum.  Whatever.  But a Dark and Stormy is a CLASSIC rum cocktail!  The best they could offer Sweet Pea \"if he likes Dark and Stormys \" was a mojito which is NOTHING like a dark and stormy!  He got it, and I tasted it, and honestly it may be the best mojito I've ever had.  But still.  I tried to order an iced tea, but they didn't have that either.  I considered sparkling water but noticed it listed on the beverage menu, like all the rums, with its country of origin (Mexico) and decided against it.  \n\nWe ordered the Plantain Avocado Spring Rolls to split.  Then Sweet Pea tried to order the Jerk Chicken which has to be most peoples' main reason to go to a Jamaican restaurant, but they told him they don't have it, although it's on the menu.  What they did offer instead was a half chicken something or other, which is not on the menu, but is $5 more and doesn't even have jerk spice.  He decided to order the Jerk Pork and Polenta instead.  \n\nThe Spring Rolls were pretty pedestrian (and small at 2 rolls split in half for $10), and it just made us miss the Patties they used to have.  They gave us a \"palate cleanser\" in between courses which was unnecessary but speaks to what this place now envisions itself as having become.  My tofu was the same as always- good, and Sweet Pea did really like his Jerk Pork, but we both miss the \"old\" Breadfruit, and with all of the restaurants that we now have downtown, we will most likely not be coming back.

Which isn't a bad thing.  We just didn't have enough room to chill the other night.  No big deal.\n\nMore importantly, I've seen three bartenders at Rum Bar.  I believe Beth and Dwayne were the first to bartenders I've dealt with, and to say they are amazing and know their stuff is an understatement.  They know their rum (all 108 or so varieties).  They know their cigars, and damn it they know how to make a good drink.  Unfortunately, their work is overshadowed by the new guy whose name I never learned.  His drinks weren't bad, but his abruptness, cockiness, and attitude sucked all the magic out of the place.  \n\nOK, enough of the bad... now to the good.  The atmosphere, although small, is great.  A nice dimly lit cozy bar area is a good place to cool off or warm up, depending on the season.  But if its summer, or otherwise nice out, hit up some of the many Adirondack chairs and benches outside.  If it's a little warm the misters will overtake the patio in a good way.\n\nBut seriously, the RUM is responsible for half the namesake of this downtown gem.  Get some.  Any of their specialty cocktails listed on the menu are expertly created.  Never too sweet, never too strong... you will taste the alcohol and the complete essence of the drink.

When we saw the aptly named \"Rum Bar\" was only blocks from our home in the arts district, we were super happy. We decided to give it a go on a night of celebration. \n\nFrom the moment we walked in, there was confusion. They were about 45 minutes away from closing, which we assumed was ample time for a drink and an appetizer. I noticed that they had two of our favorite Venezuelan rums. When I explained to the bartender what kind of rum we typically like and asked if she could recommend something similar so we can broaden our horizons a bit, she looked a bit wide-eyed and proceeded to ask a man who was sitting on the corner of the bar who I am going to assume is the owner. That became the precedent for the evening. We asked a question, she asked the man at the bar. Perhaps it was her first night, and that's OK, but a few smiles would have turned this review into a positive one. In addition to her overall unfriendly demeanor, we simply couldn't get over how pretentious the place felt. My husband ordered a Cuba Libre. The bartender hesitated much longer than was necessary and told him \"we serve that rum in a snifter\" effectively telling him he couldn't order what he wanted. She then brought him a flight of rum which wasn't even the same brand as the drink he had ordered. When we both looked confused, she took it away and started to pour another flight. By now, we were really irritated and felt really unwelcome. My husband corrected her again. \"Please, I'd like a Cuba libre.\" Rum is fun, people. Maybe not wherever the owner is from, but in Venezuela, it's passed around at the beach. We drink it at every party, formal or otherwise. Cuba libre is a perfectly legitimate cocktail, just as legitimate as the mojito I ordered (which I will say, was excellent, hence the two stars instead of one) When it was clear we weren't going to accept the flight of rum she was trying to force on us, she walked over the the man at the bar yet again, who laughed (at our pedestrian choice of drink?) and waved his hand in resignation. She then brought my husband the tiniest, most watered down rum and coke imaginable. Not a Cuba libre. A rum and coke. No lime to speak of. When he asked for a lime to turn his rum and coke into some semblance of a Cuba libre, she said \"oh you wanted lime with that?!\" incredulously. \n\nWe ordered the plantain spring rolls with mango chutney. They were utterly tasteless, except for the chutney. It was basically store bought frozen won ton wrapper and not a hint of sweet plantain. Not one hint. \n\nWe're exceptionally disappointed that we didn't love this place.
