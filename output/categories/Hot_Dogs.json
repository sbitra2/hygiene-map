Then, there in the middle of the burro were three, small, fatty, burnt pieces of meat. Totally gross. They tasted like things other places would trim off and toss in the trash. I alerted the management to the issue and they apologized and gave me my money back, but why in hell would you recommend something that was so obviously bad?

It turned out that I couldn't have asked for more.\n\n1st - I love the CHC for being honest. It's a straight-up, no frills, burger and hot dog stand.

They have some options to tart them up a bit, but I just went with the onions and a bit of ketchup. I wouldn't say that they are a one-for-one with the White Castle sliders, but pretty close, and quite possibly better. Order two for just over $2...\n\nC. - Chicago and hot dogs, a culinary dynasty. You can argue about which city has the best pizza, but those kids up near Lake Michigan have got the hot dog market covered. CHC has the all beef Vienna dogs, the poppy seed buns, and all the right fixins (scary green relish, sport peppers, tomatoes, and celery salt...) to throw down with a nearly perfect \"Chicago Dog\". Comes with Fries for $4... Eat one and smile while you think about enjoying the taste of Chicago without the January weather.\n\nLastly, I did make it around to one of those peanut butter milkshakes. It was great. Thick enough to stand a spoon in, and plenty of real peanut butter. It's not so sweet that one can't enjoy it as an accompaniment to to the sliders and dog, instead of dessert.\n\nIt's not too often that a place lives up to its own hype, but the Chicago Hamburger Co. was everything that I was craving and more.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "So the bf and I are moving in together.

We needed a quick, yummy, cheap meal before a movie (that budget is dwindling as well) and T is from Illinois so he has a fondness for sliders.  Me, as a native Phoenician, not so much into the slider.  When I was traveling in the Midwest once, some friends took me to White Castle.  I don't know if there is anything more repulsive to me than steamed meat.  Just the phrase alone is like some sort of weird phrase that should have its own category like oxymoron, but instead of meaning opposites it means disgusting.  I digress...\n\nSo CHC is an order at the counter, plastic chairs, thin paper napkin kinda place.  And that totally works.  The abundance of Chicago sports memorabilia on the walls completely distracts you from the less than fine dining atmosphere.  There were a number of other customers in who seemed like regulars and the parking lot was packed.  We ordered six cheese sliders with just ketchup, a basket of fries and two medium root beers.  The sliders are like a buck each and come with the works including onions, pickles, ketchup, brown mustard and something else I'm probably forgetting.  I thought they were pretty good with just the ketchup, but the bf ordered another with the works and said that was the way to go.  Now, I don't know if they steam their burgers or they grill them but these were hot, flavorful and chewy.  The buns were fluffy and delicious.  The fries were crispy and salty as fries should be and I ate nearly the entire basket.  The medium soda is more like a large and I would order the small next time.  \n\nThere is one tv with sports and I would guess this would be a great place to watch a Chicago game.

The smell of GRILLED ONIONS hits you before you even touch the front door.  That is the definition of a Chicago dog/burger joint.  That IS Maxwell Street.  That IS Chicago.\n\nThe Food - I ordered the fire dog, a cheese slider, and fried zucchini.\nThe firedog didn't let me down in the authenticity department.  Good meat, the correct and required condiments (neon relish, celery salt, sport peppers, tomato, mustard, onion. and seedy seed bun), cooked just right, and it smelled up the office when I opened it.  \nThe slider was the ex-factor.  I saw 'slider' and immediately thought White Castles.  But I didn't want to compare it to that, so I slapped my head to get the thought outta there.  Its a little burger with mustard, onions, and cheese.  What makes it special is the way the meat's taste melds with the onions, mustard and especially the bun.  Mine had a little too much mustard...and the bun wasn't a player on the field at all.  In fact, the sub-par bunnage took away from the slider.  BUT, I said I wouldn't compare it to Whitey One Bite's (White Castle's), so for what it is...ITS GOOOOOOD!  You will find yourself wishing you bought 2 or 82 more of them.\nThe zucchini was just filler for the car ride back to the job.  They were greasy and crunchy enough to get me excited at first...but their charm wore off after about 5 of them.  They are little chips of zucchini fried nice and crispy.  The taste of the batter just didn't do it for me, and the flavor of the  zucchini wasn't quite on point.  Doh, I REALLY hate saying anything negative about this place, because of....\n\nThe Atmosphere:\nYou know what kind of place you're in when you open the door.  A joint.  Pure joint.\nChicago newspaper clips, posters, political campaigns, pennants, whatever you can take from Chicago and stick on a wall.  This is the first time I've walked into a Chicago joint and was actually MOVED.  The place made me a little misty.  \nI miss Chicago.  \nThis joint made me remember some of my happier times as a kid, when life didn't suck.\nIts the kind of place you go and sit down with your team or with your buddies or with your kids or with your ma or with your worse enemy.  The SMELL OF GRILLED ONIONS makes everything just fine with the world.  Its the kind of place you go after you've just had some kind of fun, or even some kind of heartache.  Its just the kind of place you can go whenever, for whatever reason.  You feel like you belong here; like the world's bitter and evil hands can't reach you here.  You feel...safe.  Sorry to go off on that tangent, but its just something about the actual establishment itself...\nWho cares about what the floors look like, or what's in the corners?  Its a joint.  Its got joint floors and joint corners and joint tables and chairs.  Ain't nothing crawling.  Nuff' said.\n\nThe Service:\nAfter my nostalgic head-trip back to Chi-Town, I had to let the guy at the counter know they had done right by me.  Not much conversation due to the uncanny line that seemingly popped up out of nowhere behind me.  He told me that when I call in an order, \"Aw, you ain't gotta wait in line, just come on up.\"  That was almost the equivalent of him saying \"I love ya', man!\"  Without the awkwardness.  Oh, when I said I was picking up for 'Mike'...they all went \"Mike's here!  Got Mike here!  Get Mike's order!!!  Let's go!\"  Maybe its a routine, but it makes a guy feel like a million friggin bucks in a recession.  Let's just say I walked out of there feeling 10 times better than I did before I walked in.  And lastly, an elderly lady came in, and they all knew her name.  The guy immediately asked if she wanted something to drink.  I don't know...that just sat right with me.\n\nThe Value:\nOn.  The.  Money.  I kid you not, you got 5 bucks, you can eat...and good.  Get a couple sliders and fries for under 5 bucks.  Or one of the dogs and fries.  You're looking at a little more for an Italian Beef (which I intend to trek back there for), or something like that.  Money is an issue for most people, but you won't hurt yourself having lunch here twice a week.\n\nThe Bottom Line:\nDespite the lack-luster experience with my zucchini and bun, I must say this:  Go here.  Go here often.  Smile when you get to the counter.  Tell them they have a nice place, even though they already know it.  Eat sliders.  Eat dogs.  Eat Frito Pie (and tell me how it was....while you stand a few feet away from me with that corn chip breath).  Sit down here.  Bring friends.  Bring people you don't know that much.  Bring people you don't like that much.  Just see how things turn out.  Your stomach and mouth will be happy.  Your heart will be happier, but perhaps out of a few years.  Write about it.  Talk about it.

The fries were fine--hot and soft and starchy on the inside, barely crisp on the outside, with just the perfect amount of salt (not too much, in other words). Nothing special, really.

At the least, it could only be the second worst thing I've ever had in my mouth.\n\nMaui Dog is a quaint \"beachside\" place on Indian School, between 35th and 36th Streets. Surfer decor and a raw ceiling of asbestos and water stains create a charm not seen outside the area with the highest murder rate in Phoenix.\n\nTrusting the counter girl, who was confused at my \"aloha,\" she suggested a straight \"Maui Dog\" with Tater Tots and I also wanted to sample the \"Spam Slider.\"  I'm still not convinced it wasn't a sexual-act list she was offering me for $10. What a bargain THAT would be!\n\nThe dog is quite tasteless which allows for the mix of spicy chipotle mayo and the coconut-mango-pineapple dressing on top to take over...except for the large-ass bun masking that, too. The bun was bulky and dry and felt like it would revert to sawdust at any moment. I'm guessing it's authentic to the islands, where old hippies move to only discover toilet paper is $12 a roll.\n\nThe Spam Slider was a teaspoon of meat on a bun the size of my head and some island mix thrown on the top. I will not be ordering that again. Best advice...get the three-slider special and put all the meat and topping on one bun...and hollow out the bun...and still count on a lot of bread after that.\n\nWhat was left of my tots, which weren't dropped on the filthy tray by \"Shakes\" the friendly waitress, who I believe had just sampled some Maui-Wowee out in the parking lot, were okay.

We were greeted immediately upon entering with a friendly, \"Aloha!\" by the young woman behind the counter.  She asked if we had been to Maui Dog before and when we told her we hadn't, she handed us menus and told us a bit about the food and how to order.  We could build out own hot dog or select from a \"Shaka Dog\" - one of their six creations.  After asking a bit about the different sauces and toppings, we made our selections: the Island Dog for me and the Sunset Dog for her, plus tater tots and drinks (free refills).  We paid, got our drinks, and sat down to wait.\n\nThe decor is pretty simple but not at all boring or even gaudy.  Hawaiian and island-style memorabilia adorned the walls.  The tables and chairs are very basic but are comfortable.  My friend and I took note of the patio seating outside (which overlooks Indian School) and agreed it would be a nice place to sit when the weather finally cools down.  Only a few minutes passed before our food was brought out to us on a large tray.\n\nI don't think either of us swallowed our first bite before remarking how delicious it was!  My dog was stuffed with an all-beef hot dog (I chose that instead of the standard all-beef brat) and was layered with juicy pineapple, shredded coconut, chipotle garlic mayo, and Maui mustard, which was one of the most delicious sauces I've ever tasted.  I wasn't sure what to expect when she described it as a passion fruit mustard, but wow - I'm a fan.  The whole thing was topped off with a generous helping of crumbled, extra-crispy (my request) bacon.  The flavors all worked incredibly well together - sweet, spicy, salty, tangy, fruity, meaty - it was an amazing mix of food synergy.  The tots were really great, too - super crispy and flavorful in a way I can't describe.  It's almost as though they're fried in a flavored oil.  Everything worked so well together.  Midway through our meal, our waitress stopped by to check on us and make sure everything was ok.  We assured her, though full mouths, that all was very well.\n\nEven though I was full, I had to get some shave ice to go.  I have a thing for shave ice and feel compelled to get some anytime I find it.  After looking over their very long list of flavors, I settled on tiger blood (cherry-coconut) and passion fruit.  If I have to identify something at this place which is sub par, it would be the shave ice.  It certainly wasn't bad, and the favors were very nice, but instead of using a large frozen block of ice, bags of ice cubs/chunks/pieces were used.  I'm not an expert on the mechanics of shave ice, but I have a feeling this led to the very chunk consistency of my icy treat.  It didn't stay light and fluffy like most shave ice does, but instead turned into something similar to a convenience store Icee.  That's my only gripe, though, and it's not one which will prevent me from going back and enjoying some more shave ice.\n\nWe overheard the owner talking with other customers while we ate.  Some things to note: They are working on getting the drive-thru up and running.  Call-ahead orders are welcome. Online ordering is in the works.  For a place that's only been open for six weeks, this place has the makings to do very well in the area.\n\nGreat job, Maui Dog.

Nor will I go on about the way they support other small businesses by sourcing ingredients and supplies locally. What I love most of all, they take risks that many corporation restaurants wouldn't dare.\n\nTake Maui Dog for instance, l mean really, who opens a restaurant specializing in Hawaiian style hot dogs? Ask owner John Stamatakis, who started his hot dog venture last year in the building that housed Ricky's Philly. The tiny structure has gotten the island treatment with tiki torches, bright colors and a warm friendly vibe. What they don't have in square footage they make up for in charm and of course menu offerings. \n\nThe menu boasts a series of hot dogs, sliders and some serious toppings. There is one nagging question though, what's a Hawaiian hot dog? To be honest, I had no idea until I did some research. Ends up Hawaiian hot dogs are just like any other hot dog except for a slightly sweetened bun, some variation of garlic mayo and a laundry list of tropical flavors including passion fruit infused mustard to chopped banana and coconut. \n\nBefore I go on about the food, I have to give you one bit of advice, ask them to make sure they steam the buns! On my visit this crucial detail wasn't fulfilled so what I ended up with were slightly dry and mostly stale buns. I made mention of this to the owner who quickly offered to replace the order, this is what I call great customer service. \n\nOn first bite I felt deep love for MD's Lava Dog Shaggy Style ($5.50). Its a beef hot dog slather in lava, which is their house made chili, then topped with cheese and coleslaw, the later making it shaggy. I went further and ordered it Maui style, which means that it will additionally be topped with chipotle garlic mayo, Maui mustard, coconut and pineapple. I had no idea you could pile so much on one hot dog and still have it work. It's a whole lot of flavor but melds so well together. Fortunately the heat from the chili and hot dog also managed to make the extremely soft and what I love saying, squishy. \n\nOkay canned meat has a really bad wrap, nothing like congealed animal parts to make a person run for the hills. So bear with me when I say go ahead and try a Spam Slider ($1.25). Ordinarily I would have never ordered one but the lady at the counter assured me it was worth a taste. My only experience with Spam was my mothers doing, Span sandwiches, come on, you've had them too! Anyway, once you top a slice of grilled Spam with sweet mustard, coconut and pineapple, Maui style, I think you might have a different impression, sweet and salty is a great combo. \n\nIf Spam isn't your bag, go for the Teriyaki Slider ($1.25), Maui style of course. This version replaces the Spam with a tender ground beef patty and a smothering of teriyaki sauce. \n\nIf you love potatoes with your hot dogs and sliders, be sure to order a basket of MD's hand cut French Fries ($1.75). These are the real deal, tender with a slight crisp. If you want sheer crunch good times order up the Tater Tots ($1.75). These little chubs of shredded potato come out super crispy and well seasoned. \n\nJudging by the steady stream of diners, it seems like this indie resto is a hit with the locals.

These are flaws that I personally believe caused Rumbis to fail, and might possibly be a problem for Joeys as well (but hopefully not):\n\n1. The parking spots are awkward. When you enter the lot, you are naturally drawn to park in front of the Wildflower restaurant, while the Rumbis/Joeys restaurant feels \"out-of-the-way\". During busy times, finding a parking spot in this complex is practically impossible, but the other restaurants seem to be doing ok, so maybe this isn't that big of a deal. It's definitely something I noticed, though.\n\n2. The dining room area is WAY TOO BIG and EMPTY. Hotdog joints simply shouldn't have twenty empty tables. It doesn't feel cozy or authentic (which is practically a requirement for a thematic restaurant like this). Instead, it feels empty, lonely, sterile, and deserted, and that's even when there are people there! The previous Rumbis restaurant there had the exact same problem (it even looks like Joeys kept almost all of the same furniture). Having a cramped dining area that only holds a couple of people has an interesting effect: It makes the place look popular even when only a few people are there.

I am a hot dog snob. Growing up in Northwest Indiana, I made it up to Chicago quite a few times and many of those times I got a hot dog (The Wiener Circle/Char-Dogs is by far my fav) Also, I am a HUGE White Castle fan and cannot stand living off the frozen sliders I have to buy in SoCal (I even attempted to make my own homemade White Castle sliders... and failed).\n\nThe Food:\nAs my parents live right down the street, I drove by this place and had to try the authentic chicago style dog. So one night my gf and buddy drove down and placed a to go order for ourselves and parents at home. My parents had steamed hot dogs, I ordered a char cheese dog and cheese fries, my gf had the polish and my buddy had the italian beef. We also ordered 4 of \"Bob's Sliders\" which he references to White Castle on the menu.\n\nThe dogs and polish were all awesome. They had that real vienna beef taste and snap. They also used the steamed buns with the black seeds on them which made it. The cheese sauce on my dog was plentiful and tasty. Altho not as bomb as Char-Dogs in ChiTown, it was pretty damn tasty. I ordered my dog Charred (you can also order it steamed) but I dont think it was charred, although it would be hard to tell with all the cheese. The cheese fries were also good, homemade fries, a little darker than your usual fry, and covered in cheese. I couldve asked for just a bit more cheese sauce, and a little crispier fries (these were a little soggy with the cheese sauce, but I also took them to go so I dont know if theyd be crispier in store). The slider was good... for a burger. It was tasty, however it was NO WHITE CASTLE. No resemblance at all except for a smaller bun. Oh ya, and when you order a soft drink, dont expect Pepsi or Coke... Bob has RC cola streamin here!\n\nService:\nI assume the guy that took my order was Bob and the owner. Real nice guy, obviously from Chicago. I ordered ketchup on my dads dog and he was offended and joking with me. He was all over the shop talkin to the other couple that was eating there. Really nice guy. He took the order but did not make the food, there was another guy doin the cookin. I think he was new, because this is why my review gets a 4 rather than a 5. As we walked in, the other couple ordered fried chicken (which looked awesome). They ended up takin it back to be cooked longer. I saw it, didnt look pink or anything, but they wanted it more cooked I guess. As for our order, we placed an order for 2 cheese sliders and 2 jalapeno cheese sliders. We ended up getting all 4 jalapeno cheese sliders. Not too big of a deal. Also, as mentioned above, Im pretty sure my dog was no charred but steamed (opposite of what I ordered). It was still good. The one thing that my roommate wouldnt shut up about... he never got his peppers with his italian beef. We didnt check before we left, but he said that the peppers really make the sandwich, so he was a little pissed about that.\n\nConclusion:\nOverall everyone liked the food. Next time I go, I will prob order 2 cheese char dogs and maybe fries (but the dogs are where its at). I would probably eat there and double check the order. Im sure the cook was new as is the restaurant and everything tasted bomb. The decor is fun and chicago-y and the owner is genuine and nice.

It is the food that I grew up on.  Instead of Gerber's I had Harold's Chicken.  Nuff' said.\nSo here's a joint that puts 'Chicago' in their name, and they expect me to come to them with wide eyes and an anxious stomach.  Well, I'll admit that I did get wide eyed when I saw them pop up on Mapquest as I searched for nearby restaurants.  And my stomach did indeed get vocal after reading about them here on Yelp.\n\nSo I went for lunch.\n\nI pull into a spot and step into the joint.  Its exactly that - a joint.  Nondescript decor with a flat screen in the corner.  Everyone has a flat screen except me.  \nIs the place dirty?  Let me ask you this...do you plan on eating off of the floor?  No?  Well don't worry about it.\nSure the bottom of your shoes will have some new dirt on them, but so what.  \nThe kitchen is wide open and you can see everything that goes on, which is nice.  There's a few tables sitting around for those of you who don't like eating at the office.  And yes, you can eat here without being worried about bugs sharing your table.\nI couldn't care less about what the place looks like.  It could be a little rectangle with a grill in one corner, a cash register in another, myself in the third, and a fold up chair in the last one.  All that matters to me are two things when I'm stepping into a genuine joint: the food and the price.\n\nThe Food:  Ok, I tried the Italian Beef.  Now, I know you don't go to a place called Chicago Red Hots to order Italian Beef your first time in.  But I recently saw an episode of Man Vs. Food where Adam was eating Italian Beef...I've been craving it since.  Plus I haven't had one in about 15 years.\nI noticed that the price was about $5 for it.  I was broke, but I was in lust.  So I got it.  The service was noteworthy.  I was greeted with smiles and hellos.  That gets an automatic star from me.  I suppose these are the owners everyone speaks of.  Their daughter was there with a friend, and it was kinda touching at how her mother was making a big fuss over them having enough to eat.  \nAnyway, I get the sandwich in a nice amount of time.  Back at my desk, I sat down and opened up the bag.  While doing so, images floated around my mind of that roll bread all soaked in gravy and me with juice running down my fingers as I munched.  However when I reached in and pulled the sandwich out, something very wrong happened.  I pulled out the tiniest Italian Beef I've ever seen in my life.  I though maybe I got the wrong order, but there was no one else there but me ordering so that couldn't be it.\nI unwrapped it and sure enough, it was a mini-Italian Beef.  At least it was cute.  \nNo gravy.  It wasn't dipped.  Just meat, peppers, onions, and bread.  No juice.  Strike one.\nI picked the little thing up, bit into it.  Again, no juice.  But the taste?  I am sad to say that it was only passable.  \nIt wasn't like \"Oh my God, an Italian Beef!\"  It was more like, \"This ain't right.\"\nDon't get me wrong, it wasn't nasty.  Just not really good.  Disappointing.\nPlus it was way too little for the price.\nNow before I judge this place and condemn it to greasy spoon hell, I'll go back and try some dogs.  If those pass, then I will revise this review and give them a passing grade.  After all, it is all about the dogs anyway.\nI just figured that if they can do the 'other' stuff right, then they've probably got the dogs down.  Now I am afraid of what I'll find when I order a Chicago Style.  If I see ketchup, all is lost.\n\nBottom line?  Its a joint.  The service is great.  The menu is non-complicated and has dogs, fries and sandwiches (what else do you need?)  Its pricier than it should be, but the convenience to the area is a plus.  My meal was not that good.  But I am picky.  Waaaay too picky when it comes to a 'Chicago Style' place.  This is not my final verdict, as I have not tried their bread and butter - the dogs.  \n\nUntil further notice, I can only give Johnnie 2 stars...\n\nOk...tried this place again today (3/6/09)\nI got a red hot this time.  Decent.  Not the best outside of Chicago, but a valiant effort.  There was nothing on there that shouldn't have been, and there was nothing missing either.\nTaste?  On point.  No gripes, but remember I said that it wasn't the best I've had outside of Chi-Town.  Maybe this is as good as it gets in Phoenix???\nAgain, the service was great.  A hello, a smile, and he reminded me to get napkins.  What more do you want?\nThe price still isn't my idea of great...but on par with the rest of the stuff around here.\n\nSo now, I must try the Polish Sausage.  That will be Johnnie's ultimate test.

I hope their rent is low, because this place looks like it is going to have a hard time. \n\nOn a Thursday night around 7:30, I arrived ready to have a big, juicy, all-beef frank which they advertized on their website as one I couldn't refuse. Well, I'd have to refuse the hot dog itself, but everything else I'd take in moderation. For starters, this restaurant used to be a hot dog cart in various Phoenix and Las Vegas locations, and they expanded to a restaurant back in December of 2010. Generally from a hot dog cart, you find the food hit and miss, depending on the cart, but this restaurant got both the hit and miss in one building. They bake their tater tots, which taste oh so glorious... nothing special about the tots themselves, and they taste like store bought tots, but I've never had them baked, and it seem to really make a difference. They were crispy, but not greasy, and had a perfect mix of salt and pepper. For $2, the portion was over the top large. Unfortunately, that was the end of the tremendous praise I'd be paying to Dawgfather. I'm not picky about my Chicago Hot Dog, really. As long as it's made properly with mustard, celery salt, sport peppers, tomatoes, relish, onion, pickle spear, and a steamed poppy bun, I'm good to go. DawgFather got it all right, except two ingredients, which unfortunately are the most important ones, the bun and the dog. The bun used for the Chicago dog was a standard white bread bun, slightly toasted, which is a huge no, and the dogs themselves, which I'm assuming are the advertised Eisenberg dogs, are not Eisenberg's best work. The small, leathery dog was almost hidden underneath all the toppings. I would rather have had a big juicy plump Hebrew National dog with the same toppings, which they did a perfect job with.\n\nAfter my meal, I was told I could have chosen between a steamed poppy bun and the grilld white bun, they were then told I could have been notified that when I ordered. The point may all be moot anyway, as I only saw one other customer come in during the hour that we sat in the restaurant. Unless this place takes off quickly, it's going to be hemmoraging money faster than Bret Michael's brain. Another quick add, is the \"chef\" here at DawgFather, is a really nice and helpful guy. He seems extremely interested in making sure his customers are happy and telling them everything they need to know to order what they would want. They certainly get it when it comes to people skills, but as for choosing which dog to sell to the customers, and how to assemble the dog, they are losing as of right now.... which isn't to say it's not normal for Arizona hot dog carts.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 3, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "This is a perfect lunch stop if you're ever downtown - amazing dawgs, great prices, faygo rootbeer, and a homey atmosphere.

The owner brought out our orders and was hilarious giving us all a hard time for the ingredient omissions we all asked for.

The Dawg Father Grill opened around the end of 2010. I stumbled upon it a little after it opened. As mentioned by the other reviewer the Chef used to run hotdog carts in Vegas and other places.\n\nDawg Father serves burgers, hotdogs, cheesesteaks, a chicken caesar salad or wrap and itallian beef. Drinks consist of canned and bottled soda, teas as well as water. Sides options include a bag of chips, tater tots and french fries. That's the basics.\n\nOn my first trip in to a hotdog joint I opted for the cheesesteak. Who does that? I do. I figure if you're going to be so bold as to be a hotdog joint that serves cheesesteaks as well, then they're either going to be pretty good or horrible. Their cheesesteak lies somewhere in the middle. While I enjoyed the cheesesteak I walked away slightly confused. The bun was good. The veggies were good. The steak was good. The weird part came with the cheese sauce which I believe was some sort of nacho cheese sauce. I don't actually have a problem with that but it's just not right on a traditional cheesesteak and at the very least should be declared on the menu before one consumes the cheesesteak. I really feel some sort of other cheesesauce should be in order and the nacho cheese could be used on some sort of southwest cheesesteak maybe.\n\nThe cheeseburger I had was excellent. Cheese melted perfectly atop the beef which was pretty good. The bun was great and I was happy. Thumbs up on the cheeseburger for sure.\n\nNow for the hotdogs. I started writing this review in January and have just been too lazy to finish it and had not really had much for hotdogs at the time so here goes. While I'm not that exciting or daring of a guy when it comes to hotdogs I finally dove in a had a hotdog that wasn't just plain with mustard. The hotdog I had was the philly cheesesteak dog. It was good. I really don't know what to say though. I felt weird after eating it. My mind and tummy were full of confusing and mixed emotions. It was so right yet so wrong. My comments are not meant to dissuade you at all it's just that there was too much going on with the dog for me. I would try it again maybe with a different cheese. If that doesn't appeal to you then you'll surely find some other crazy hotdog on the menu that will. These guys are all over the place with crazy dogs. They've even got an extreme dog which is half hamburger/half hotdog. \n\nThey serve Eisenberg and Vienna Beef dogs. I had never heard of Eisenberg but as a semi-fat guy that has consumed a pretty good variety of dogs over the years I was impressed with the taste. I think Dawg Father/Refi Guy made a good choice in his picking of the Eisenberg brand. As long as this place is opened I will forever stop in and get a plain dog with mustard because it's good and makes me happy.\n\nI hope this place lasts because it's nice to see a guy try and experiment a little bit with his menu and it's a nice alternative to the Dog House.\n\n4 stars for their boldness and daring in their menu. 4 stars for them being personable.\n\nStop in and give them a try!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Well, I finnaly got the chance to ceck this place out.

I lifted the bun up with fingers I just wiped my runny nose with (I know, I'm totally gross but I thought it was my food) and saw that it was not what I ordered. At the very same time the bartender came hurrying back, saying she accidentally gave me someone else's order.\n\nAs she whisked it away I explained that she'd have to make it over again because I already touched it and I have a cold. She kind of laughed and brought the plate back to the kitchen window. I watched while the cook did nothing more than put the big toothpick back into to bun and sent the contaminated plate out to the unsuspecting diner.\n\nI don't know if the bartender didn't tell the cook what I said about already touching it and having a cold, or if neither of them cared. What I do know, however, is that is really, really gross, and if I knew that I was eating someone else's snot germs I'd barf.\n\nSo if you ate at BluBurger last night and you develop a cold this weekend, now you know why.", "review_stars": 1, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 11, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "On the plus side....\n\nI love being able to fully customize my burger.

A woman's cooking up the dogs and sliding them into their wonderfully soft, pillowy bolillo buns, and a man dresses them and wraps them up in foil for you.

According to the survey, Smashburger is rated in the top five, behind Five Guys, In-N-Out, Fuddruckers, and A&W/ http://www.marketforce.com/press-releases/item/five-guys-is-americas-favorite-burger-chain/\n\nFor the life of me, I can't understand how ANY of these places finished ahead of Smashburger. MAYBE Fuddruckers, but c'mon...the rest of that list is ridiculous, IMHO.\n\nNow, for the most part, I try and avoid red meat. The occasional steak is alright, but I typically lean towards chicken or fish. But, there's just something about Smashburger...I think it might have a hint of Kryptonite in it. Whenever we're anywhere near Smashburger, we just have to go. (I've GOTTA double up on those self-control exercises.)\n\nI love everything about this place. The decor is modern and clean. The digital menus add a sleek touch.The people behind the counter are always chipper and inviting. Basically, this place offers everything most people look for in a restaurant.\n\nNow, they have a relatively diverse menu, offering different styles of pre-made burgers, ranging from the standard plain burgers, cheeseburgers, all the way up to burgers with avocado. However, I, being a mild control-freak, always create my own burger.  \n\nMy typical order consists of a regular \"Smash\" sized burger on a whole wheat bun. I get the usual lettuce, tomato, pickle...but where I add my own little twist is with the additions of bacon and jalapenos. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=VaxMJX3yI4MSCIItqFiU2A&userid=IBiHQzvzP01UNuLbADSz4A The cuts of bacon they use at this joint are INCREDIBLY thick and crisp...the two best qualities of bacon! And then there are the jalapenos...holy har (BTW, \"har\" is Arabic for \"HOT!!!)!!! These jalapenos tend to leave you with a case of the sniffles. If you're not into that kind of spice on your burger, you might want to steer clear of this little addition.\n\nNow, there are plenty of sides available here...but if you don't get the sweet potato fries at least once in your life, you're doing yourself an INCREDIBLE disservice! I don't know who the genius was who decided to start frying up sweet potatoes, but that person is my hero/heroine!\n\nWhen all is said and done, you're looking at about $10/person when you eat here. When you consider the fact that this burger chain is nationally ranked, you could consider that price a bargain. If you're smart, you'll get in on the ground floor and enjoy one of these awesome burgers before they jack the prices up even higher!\n\nOn a side note, after you order your meal, you're given a number that you take to your table. Typically, the number tent you receive just has the number for your order. At Smashburger, each tent has its own little saying. That's the kind of quirky add-on that piques your interest! \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=lsR3EMKSo6RvMM63lF3v1A&userid=IBiHQzvzP01UNuLbADSz4A \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=4gFVEk0TOXwKD-UGXVvMXA&userid=IBiHQzvzP01UNuLbADSz4A\n\nSmashburger is one of the best burger joints in the country.

Let me begin by telling you the manner in which your \"Lead Brooke B\" presented herself in front of paying customers has left us with a sour feeling  in our stomachs and heavy hearts for the other 2 employees Sam and Jenn for having to report to such a person.\n\nOur experience began after ordering we observed  Brooke tell Jenn (while Jenn was cutting paper we're assuming for trays) that she should pretend she was getting payed while at work and go actually work. You could see on Jenn's face she was mortified and holding back the tears. I went and grabbed the manager on duty and I apologize I didn't get his name. I told him what I heard and he said Brooke's just having a bad day and apologized on her behalf.. Okay being the understanding person that I am I get being in a serving  industry you have good an bad days, just like any one we human. But to my dismay Brooke's lack of professionalism didn't end there.\n\nBrooke had asked Sam to hurry it up with the shakes that making shakes wasn't rocket science. Moments later Brooke asked Jenn to go outside to clean the tables. Jenn cleaned 2 but one family was still eating. I witnessed her taking the food they were done with and went back to the register as the line was getting pretty backed up...\n\nWhen Brooke noticed the out side dining area was still dirty, Brooke grabbed the manager and said I can't believe her (Jenn) if I could I swear I'd smack the shit out of her..\n\nThen walked to Jenn and pulled her mid sentence helping a customer and let's go outside and chat about what I mean when I ask for something to be done. At the very second I couldn't take it I stopped her and said. You are ruining our dining expirence. How dare you talk to your colleges like this.. Brooke started laughing and asked if I was serious.. I replied this is no laughing matter and you should stop smiling immediately. As a business owner my self I am appalled that she thinks this is funny. I told her my family  are paying customers and have the right to enjoy our meal but instead I have been taking notes on her behavior. She said she was sorry but that's how she is she was just kidding with them and everyone likes it or leaves it. I told her she should be apologizing to Sam and Jenn for acting that way and the rest of the diner for literally ruining all our meals. at this time an older couple behind us started clapping an thanked us for standing up for in there words those 2 poor girls.. I told Brooke that once we left I  will be contacting the franchise owner. She grabbed her badge and said here is my name and its a corporation not a franchise. My family and I left utterly disgusted.\n\nThe attitude and complete lack of respect for her colleges makes me sick to my stomach. We will never be returning to any other smash burger and negativity travels fast. One oh shit moment erases a life time of compliments.

We live close by and are always in the area.  I told him that the hot dog place closed a while back.  He then kept telling me that there is a different hot dog place.  So the next time I went to the Smith I made it a point to check it out and see what hot dog place was now in this spot.  I noticed the sign Hot Dog Heaven and immediately thought isn't that the name of the other hot place in Henderson that everyone raves about?  \n\nSo we finally were in the mood for hot dogs and decided to check this place out.  I was afraid that the hot dogs would be overpriced because the last place before this was a little expensive.  Hence, it not being there anymore?  I walked in the door and was greeted immediately by the guys who were working.  I grabbed a menu as my wife instructed me to just get her what ever I get.  I was surprised to see menu full of items that weren't hot dogs.  This place offer baby back ribs, sandwiches, and even hot wings!  The two guys were very friendly.  I had to ask them if this was the same place at the other one in Henderson.  They said it's the same name and they offer more food items.  I kind of felt embarrassed asking if it was as good as the other one.  I knew the answer I would receive.  \n\nI ordered 2 specials which consisted of a hot dog and fries.  The hot dog is Chicago style of course.  Well equipped with the neon green relish, pickle, peppers, and tomatoes.   I had to order a chili dog too.  Just to see what is was like.  \n\nOverall this dogs were good.  I am not from Chicago so I am not going to judge the hot dog so much. It was tasty and the bun to hot dog ratio was good.  The size of the dogs were healthy.  The chili dog was OK.  I think I just like my chili a certain way.  I wish it was a little spicier.  The french fries were really good too.  \n\nIf these dogs were a little more expensive then I would have expected more.  This place is definitely worth trying out.  Especially if you live in this area since the dining options are a little limited.  It's a good alternative to the other fast food joints and won't break your wallet like the tapas and other places in the shopping center.  I will definitely come here again.

Good things are happening with Buldogi's. Also, it needs to be said: this is run by some of the nicest people. They always take care of us and will have our business.\n\nAt the time of writing, it is in soft opening mode. Everything is half off. I think they close down this week around 2 or 3pm and only serve breakfast. I believe next week will be a lunch menu which includes more of their original menu from the Fort Apache location.\n\nIf you've been to Buldogi's before, you already will know their lunch menu. A mix of gourmet hot dogs with extravagant toppings, some bowls, burgers, and a hangover soup. You should look up the Fort Apache location to get the reviews on that menu. What's new is breakfast!\n\nYou've got an assortment of pancakes, waffles, french toast, and eggs. Sounds about right. There's even a Monte Cristo sandwich - which is French toast turned into a sandwich containing ham, turkey, eggs, and some jam. But then, the fusion starts.  The loco moco makes a comeback from the lunch menu, as well as the hangover soup. How about a mung bean pancake? Bulgogi and rice with eggs?\n\nWe took two of the new additions on the menu and one familiar hangover soup.\n\n- Mung bean kimchi pancake. This is served with rice, two eggs, a side dipping sauce for the pancake, and a little cup of chopped cucumber and tomato. The pancake tastes great! Definitely something we haven't had before. It's dense, savory, and can be filled with either a few vegetable slices or pork belly. There is a weird lack of kimchi despite it being in the title. In terms of flavors and eating enjoyment, this is excellent. For value, it is not high (at normal price). To me, $11 is steep for the pancake's small size,  but I don't know if this is the final word. Especially for the area, it's going to be a tough sell. In thinking of points for increasing value - adding banchan!\n\n- Monte Cristo French Toast. This is your ham and turkey sandwich, topped with eggs your way and made extra rich via French toasting the bread slices. The bread is cooked fluffy and flavorful, while the whole sandwich is generally served warm topped with (as requested) a liquid yolk. It is indulgent. Very, very indulgent and deliciously so. There is just no way you aren't going to love this. There is a side of jam with it but I didn't find it necessary - though HsiuTing Y. says that's how I'm supposed to eat it.

Beginning first with three Buldogi classics, two all-beef hotdogs and one order of fries, it should go without saying that both the franks and the house-made toppings were excellent and although fries proved a bit limp the combination of garlic and pork proved surprisingly light, the later gracing the briny Gang-nam for a smoky sapor that I only wish would have been present in the watery ham atop the underwhelming, bready, and overcooked Monte Cristo that arrived alongside an equally doughy waffle thankfully rescued by reference standard Korean Fried Chicken, crispy and lacquered with briny soy-caramel - by far the best bite of the afternoon and the best Korean Fried Chicken I've found in town.

In fact, my wife pointed out that this guy, who came in and ordered AFTER us, got his take-out order at least 15 minutes BEFORE us. Finally our food arrived, but it was well below par.

There was a good amount of sausage, but it was still pink in the center and didn't seem cooked through. The bun was, as my wife would say, wasted carbs. The fries were okay and nothing special.

The tables are close together, again resulting in a food court feel and the tables are small. \n\nOther than pretty good food, don't expect much.

make much of an impression on me either way :-I\n\nBut I thought to myself...well, I like lunch:)\n\nAnd, I like taco's:)\n\nAnd I was a hippie of the first water back in my day (which, BTW, means that it's no longer \"My Day\", sadly:(\n\nBut I'm not thrilled by Two Hippies taco's:(\n\nI got dos taco's...a chicken and a carne asada, along with a can of soda pop...the people taking my $5.00 cash were very nice (and they were trying to dress up like hippies or something, too!...too adorable for words:)\n\nI didn't get fish taco's...experience (the kind gained through trial and many, many errors)...has taught me that the only place that I really like to get fish tacos, is from one of the beach palapa's in Bahia de Navidad...where the panga's pull right up on the sand...the fishermen jump out and hand the cook in the palapa a red snapper or dorado or something else with fins...they clean it, cut it up, grill it, throw some lettuce and homemade salsa on it and it's a taco about 30 minutes after it quit swimming:)\n\nThose are pretty good fish taco's...esp. washed down with a cerveza or three:)...I don't remember the name of the place...probably \"taco de playa\" or something...just walk down the beach...you can't miss it:)\n\n10 pesos each for the taco's, 25 pesos a pop for the cerveza...it's a very good deal:)...BTW, that doesn't include round-trip first class airfare or the Governors Suite at the Grand Bay:)\n\nNo beach at 5th and Camelback:(\n\nBut, I digress:)\n\nI liked the service and the price (and I really appreciate the staff trying to look like hippies for me...really...a blast from past:)\n\nI really didn't care for the food, itself...outrageous has a number of different connotations, depending on context...but I didn't find the taco's \"outrageous\" in any sense of the word:)\n\nAlthough nowhere near as bad as Skip & Jan's attempt at taco's, the hippies taco's leave more than a bit to be desired...the carne asada was dry, stringy, bland, and the salsa they give you in the little plastic cups didn't really improve things.\n\nSo I tried the chicken taco and found it to be dry, stringy, bland, and the salsa they gave...!\n\nHey wait a minute...did they just give me two of the same thing and try to call them something different?!?!?...\n\nThat would be so like the hippies I knew back in the `60's and `70's:-)...always stoned, never quite sure what they were doing...so much fun to watch:)\n\nBut no, they gave me carne asada and chicken...the taco's just looked and tasted very much alike (the chicken was somewhat whiter, but other than that...not much difference:(\n\nIn Phoenix, a city with so many options for getting my taco fix, even the nostalgia for times long gone (and thankfully so...can you imagine a world in which all we want to do is sit around all day, get high, and make love...not war...where would we all be? :-) can't make up for these lackluster offerings:(\n\nThere are tons of better taco shop's...many of

The review was for one star and did not sound too complimentary.  I read the other reviews and saw a crazy mix of low and high.  The five star reviews are funny because A) It's just a hot dog place, and B) They are clearly done by people without a lot of reviews which leads me to believe they are posted by owner/insiders etc.\n\nAnyways, I decided to go eat here with my kid and see what the real deal is.  This was pretty close to the Dave and Busters we go to play video games at so it worked out this weekend.  \n\nThe dogs - I like the fact they use Sabretts for the dogs and I thought they were really good.  I got the chili dog.  A previous reviewer said that they did not get enough chili sauce in the cup, but I found it to be more than enough of a serving, and I like a lot on my chili dog.  I would have preferred the chili not have beans in the sauce as I do not like chili with beans on my dog due to the texture of the beans.  Wolfe's brand coney dog sauce for example does away with the beans and I like that better.\n\nThe fresh-made hot dog buns were a winner.  They were really nice, held up well, and tasted great.  These make this shop worthy of a return trip or two.  : )\n\nThe condiment bar had onions, pickles, lettuce and tons of other toppings for the dogs.  They also had ketchup, mayo, mustards, relish and bbq sauce in the squeeze pumps so there is no reason not to get a dog exactly as you like it!\n\nThe fountain drinks were refillable - and overall I really liked the menu.  Lots of options to try in the future (although I always judge a hot-dog place by the basics).\n\nI think I met the owners who did inquire if we enjoyed our meal, which is good to see.  And the store was clean, and had a good amount of business going on.   So for this, I break out three stars.

The customer suggested some type of Italian dog, and the owner was all for it! He also mentioned that they would be adding some type of burrito to the menu within the next couple of weeks.

I I tried the Sonoran dog which had a lot of flavor, definitely recommend the spicy dog that the manager recommended I get if I enjoy spicy food. The hot dogs are always juicy and flavor is never skipped by these people. I'm also not a coleslaw person but for some reason I like the flavor of theirs. I went back today after a work meeting and the manager was again very friendly, as well as the cook. I was greeted the moment I walked in even though they were busy with stocking chips and such on the floor. They have punch cards there and he made sure I get one if I hadn't already (but of course they made sure to give me one last time I came in, which I kept).  I ordered the French dog this time which is a polish dog in a baguette and melted mozzarella over it. Definitely my favorite so far, they even flavored the mozzarella with spices. It was delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant if you want to try something different from your typical hotdog.

Then you put it in a gently steamed bun, and coat it with a very local style of chili (it comes in huge cans, made in Detroit!) with meat, but no beans. Then on top go chopped onions and two long squirts of yellow mustard. True aficionados add dried red peppers and a dash of salt.  This is merely the beginning: You then add either a Miller Draft (in a glass), or, to be perfect, a Vernor's Ginger Ale (\"Aged in Wood\"!) with ice.  The hundreds of \"Coney Island\" joints all over southern Michigan attest: This is comfort food for the Motor City crowd, but anyone who tries it loves it, too.  Want to see eyes light up on a Detroiter: Just say, \"Lafayette Coney Island.\"  That's the flagship. No,  the American  next door is NOT just as good. Sorry. \n\nThe Henderson \"Detroit Motor City Coney Island\" is an outpost of this delight. It's nearly perfect: It has even more Detroit memorbilia (sports, espeically) than the Lafayette, and while it doesn't have the cast of federal judges, cops, homeless, senior executives and the occasional hooker that the Lafayette has. But has the same kind of tables, tackiness, and, even better, the thousands of crayon grafitti on the walls that grateful customers have scribbled. It has chili fries (they are different, trust me. These have no pretense of being healthy. They are that good) and it has Sanders Hot Fudge Sundaes (the ultimate). No Millers, but YES! Vernors!  And downtown Henderson does a reasonable imitation of some of Detroit in better days, including the small casino and some empty storefronts. And a biker bar next door. You want authentic? You wanna make something outta that? \n\nIt gets better: The taste? Ahhh! The meat, the chili, the onions, the mustard. Al Kaline. Detroit Lions. Hockey Town. Bob-Lo.  All of it, except the sounds of bullets whizzing. Almost Detroit.  A date meal for ten bucks. Both of you.

Fuck, what IS my password?\n\nI'm so lazy I can't even be trusted with simple tasks, like preparing my own lunch. \n\nFridays means I get out of work at 1pm, which means I have the house all to myself for a couple hours to play my upright bass as much and as loud as I want before other people start showing up and start demanding to able to hear the TV. Haters.\n\nAnyway. \n\nSo Fridays means getting takeout for lunch. Because I know that if I actually try to prepare a lunch at home, eventually I will get caught up in something else and bam, there goes my practice time until everyone goes back to bed. \n\nUsually \"practice day\" means Dragon Garden Express, but on my way there I spotted Big Daddy's Frankfurters.\n\nThough I've known about Big Daddy's for years (how could I not? I live within walking distance), I've been hesitant to give them a try. Not just because hot dogs are the rat bastard of the meat community, but because with a name like Big Daddy's, deep down I expected to walk inside to be greeted by Danny DeVito's crazy sex offender third cousin who gives me a big smile and says \"Welcome to Big Daddy's! Whose your Daddy?!\"\n\nOh, hai, I'll get a chili cheese dog and a pillow to scream in.\n\nIn spite of these fears I bravely opened the door and stepped in to find a well-adjusted-looking gentleman sitting at the counter who perked up, literally jumping to his feet the moment I stepped in. Judging by the time of day I imagined business was slow. \n\nI ordered an all-beef dog and a bratwurst. Now, personally, I've never understood the \"all-beef\" craze. While I applaud their honesty, I just think that it's a grim reminder of the reality we face with \"non-beef\" dogs.\n\nA hot dog vendor saying \"Our dogs are made with 100 percent beef\" gives me that same foreboding feeling that hearing the girl at Sephora say \"and the best part is, none of this stuff has been tested on helpless animals\".\n\nAt Big Daddy's, every dog/sausage comes with four free toppings. I opted for cheese, relish, sauerkraut and grilled Italian onions (don't judge me). \n\nAs he fixed my lunch the man at the counter, who I'll assume is either Big Daddy or at the very least Large Uncle By Marriage, said \"Man, this stuff is going to get messy when you get it home, but boy will it be good\".\n\nPersonally, I appreciate that level of honesty. I cannot begin to tell you how much less complicated my life would be if occasionally the girl at the Pane Bianco counter would say \"You're going to break your fork trying to cut these fresh tomatoes but they will be soooo juicy\", or if the bartender would say \"you're going to ruin someone else's shirt later but this drink will be delish\" when he handed me a hurricane.\n\nTo put a cherry on my sundae, he gave me a bag of chips \"on the house\". Though to be honest I think it was more a manner of cleanliness than customer service. One, I didn't complain (surprisingly), and two, it was the last bag in the box. Either way, I was being undeservingly rewarded for trying a place out for the first time, and I liked it.\n\nI rushed home with my lunch in my passenger seat, wondering exactly what he meant by it would get messy. Perhaps the sauerkraut would crumble, or the onions would be greasy.\n\nImagine my surprise when I opened my little styrofoam box to find my frank and brat covered in cheese sauce. None of that mincy shredded cheese you get at Taco Bell. Cheese sauce, thick and gooey, like the kind you get at a concession stand or gas station.\n\nYou'd think that cheese sauce and sauerkraut would be gross. And by Eris, how you would be right. It was the nastiest, messiest frank and brat I've ever had, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy that, just a little. Okay, maybe more.\n\nMy poor choice of complimentary condiments aside, the franks themselves were amazing. They tasted like they just came off the grill, like the hot dog carts that hang outside of strip malls and Home Depots.\n\nBy the end of it my face was a train wreck, like a bulldog eating custard. I scraped off onions and cheese sauce from my lips and chin, realizing that while I may have had the perfect lunch, it cost me my dignity. Which is fine. I'm actually surprised I was able to trade it in for so much.\n\nThere was more I wanted to say, but I don't feel like typing it, so I guess I'll end it here.\n\nLe sigh.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 35, "useful": 13, "cool": 15}}, {"text": "The food was good, the atmosphere and experience were quite a different thing.

Regardless it is 14.99 and that includes a drink, we came during their all you can eat king crab legs and prime rib. Both were extremely good, and this place is hardly your typical buffet. In fact  when you walk in it looks like a small diner with a buffet row, it is very much a \"divish\" location. In addition to the what is on the line, I was told you can choose ANYTHING from their menu as well and it is included. Since this place is primarily a diner most of the time you can expect quality food.\n\n Their hot dogs are excellent all beef hot dogs, and they have various other choices in sausages. There are a TON of toppings to choose from, whether it is cheese sauce (which was not bad at all), to real bacon bits to about anything else you can think of. If you want something from their menu just ask, it is included with the buffet, they'll prepare it fresh. So you want all you can eat cheesesteaks? They have you covered, unfortunately I didn't get the chance to try them because we mainly came for the all you can eat crab legs, but I will next time! I believe there are different price levels for their buffet, so make sure to ask, I believe the hot dog buffet by itself is around $8.\n\nAbove all us you can tell the place is run by good down to earth people, which I suspect are also the owners. You can tell they care about their customers and will provide you with excellent service with a GENUINE smile. Even if their food was sub par (which it isn't) the service would make me want to come back. Unfortunately we came close to closing so some of the buffet items were thinned out, but I have little doubt you could just request them to prepare something for you.\n\nLooking at their menu, even if you choose to order individual items their prices are excellent!

Prime rib was pretty good, it was actually like really thin cuts of beef almost like roast beef don't be expecting a huge slab of meat and you'll be ok. It was pretty tasty, had about 4 plates of that.  The snow crab/king crab leg mix was extremely sweet, and fresh. Very high quality.  There was a bit of a wait time in between batches when the crab ran out, but it was worth the wait.

I went to a hot dog buffet for breakfast...After jumping on Yelp to find \"something different\" and reading several of the reviews online I was intrigued and talked my man into going... Not an easy feat when he was kinda fixed on Waffle House. We called ahead to make sure and talked to the guy who assured us they had 2 separate buffets going. We chose to skip the run of the mill breakfast buffet and enjoy the hotdog/ chili/frys buffet.  We pulled up to nearly empty strip mall and walked into a small deli like place that was empty with the exception of two very friendly helpful guys. We chose what kind of dogs we wanted Sabrett's skin on and an Italian sausage which were both cooked to order... also to choose from were Viennas, Brats and Sabrett's skin off... We also got an order of fries and tater tots (they were out of sweet potato fries). The Chili that we threw on our fries and tots was thick and meaty, I am quite sure it was canned, but a good brand obviously. The two guys working were extremely friendly and helpful, clearing plates and keeping our sodas full. The coke machine was actually down, but on hand were plenty of cans to keep a coke drinker happy ( I have walked out of places not having coke...) Back to the buffet... lots and lots of little lined up containers of toppings were available. A few even contained salads which looked like they came out of a deli and we passed up on. The atmosphere... well... I was able to entertain myself with a stack of National Enquirers while my man ran down the road to McDonalds to a bathroom... (The entire strip mall was out, so I felt for them on that one..) Lots of food items and coolers are stored in the dining room as well as two deep freezers... kind of an odd set up. All in all, it was not bad, just different which I guess is what I was looking for when we walked out the door, Be careful what you wish for, lol. If I would have seen this on a Friday or Saturday night we might have been tempted to check it out for the Crab/seafood buffet, but I think I would go elsewhere having experienced them once.

The first being price. I ate here with my mother. We each had a hotdog, a small fry, and a drink. The bill came out to be almost $20. It was definitely a case of sticker shock because I feel there are a lot nicer places two people can eat for that kind of money. I did notice after I ordered that they offered canned soda which may be a more cost effective solution to help drop the bill by a few dollars if you're not the type of person to need a million refills.\n\nI'll give them some props for both polite/attentive staff and their method of ordering. It's a lot more simple to fill out a quick form and hand it over than try to have to repeat what you want several times over to a slow cashier, so... \n\nI think ultimately what it came down to was taste and presentation though. I like to spoil myself with an \"expensive\" meal from time to time if the taste is good enough to justify it. It wasn't in this case, I'm sorry to say. As I stated, I'm not really picky about hotdogs at ALL and while I guess I was kind of impressed with the overall size of the hotdog it had this horribly salty -- and dare I say, nitrate-y -- flavor that I just couldn't get past. As another reviewer mentioned, the onion slices were the size of chiclets and I'm pretty sure more of them fell off my 'dog than made it to my stomach. \n\nLastly let me just say that I, personally, was disappointed with their cheese fries. It totally looked like they opened a can of nacho cheese and just slopped it haphazardly in giant globs over the fries. Which may be just fine for some but I guess I must have been expecting something different. In defense of the fries themselves however, they were light and tasty -- not soggy or oily. \n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, this review has been edited some from the original.

It was 10:45 am and I wondered if they would be open.....they were, lucky me!\n\nI was greeted by the owner and his Wife.....at least it appeared as if they owned the joint.  They were very friendly and welcoming.  It's a casual restaurant with 10 or 12 tables inside and 8-10 counter seats near the grill.  There's also a few tables outside with umbrellas if you like to dine outdoors.\n\nI browsed the menu and was getting excited with every item I saw.....Vienna Beef Dogs, Beef Sandwiches, Iltaco Pizza Puffs......WAIT, Pizza Puffs?!  Holy $hit, that changes everything....I love those things!\n\nI couldn't control myself, so I ordered a #2 Two Chicago Dogs w/Relish, Pickle Spear, Tomato, Hot Peppers, Mustard, Onions, Seasoned Salt....and Fries ($6.00)....plus I ordered a Pizza Puff ($3.50) and washed it down with a bottle of Coke Zero.  Dammit, there goes the diet!  The lady asked for my name and asked if I was dining in or taking out....I told her dine-in.\n\nI saddled up to a table and anxiously waited for the food.  While I was waiting I noticed a man with his Son sitting at the counter.  They were eating Chicago Dogs and he was telling his Son how a Chicago Dog is made and how it should taste....the owner, who was grilling it up was there telling the kid about how to make the Dog....it was awesome.\n\nAfter a few minutes my order was ready.  The lady brought it out to my table....I unwrapped both Dogs and the bag of Fries and put them together on one wrap so I could eat it uninterrupted.  She told me the Pizza Puff was still cooking so it would be a few minutes....that's pretty standard to wait for Pizza Puffs, so I didn't care.  The Dogs were covered in Mustard, which is how I like it.....if you don't like too much Mustard on your Dog, I suggest you tell them ahead of time.  The first bite was an explosion of Awesome on my taste buds....it was sooo good!  The Vienna Beef Dog was full of flavor and the combination of toppings was just how I remember the Dogs in Chi-town.  The Relish is the atomic green colored stuff you find in Chi-town.  This place is legit!\n\nThe Fries were piping hot and seasoned with a Salty seasoning....if you don't like your Fries too Salty, then I suggest you either ask for them plain or tell them easy on the seasoning.  I liked it.  It complimented the Dogs just right.  The Dogs were average size.....not too big, do don't expect a 1/4 lb Dog with the #2.  I think they offer larger Dogs with other combo meals, but not with the #2.\n\nThe Pizza Puff came out shortly after I started eating.  I waited until I was done with the Dogs before I moved over to that bad boy.  It was wrapped in the traditional Iltaco Pizza Puff wrapper.....those of you familiar with Pizza Puffs know what I'm talking about.  I bit into the greasy, flaky, doughy Crust and mmmm.....yeah, it's the Pizza Puff that I've grown to love.  Inside of the flaky, doughy Crust is a filling of Pizza Sauce, Sausage, and Cheese.  Dammit, these things are addicting and I just discovered this place....I have a feeling I will be here often.\n\nThe owners were very attentive and asked if I was ok and needed anything.  After I was finished, they asked how I liked it....I gave them the thumbs up and a big smile.  They were smiling too and said \"See you soon Peter!\"......I love family owned businesses who pay attention to their customers.  While I was there 6 or 7 people came in and they knew all of them by first name.  I hope I get to know them better too.\n\nWill I return?

Everything is greasy and fattening, but this is not necessarily a bad thing if it is done right (and in this case it is).

If you go then you have to at least get it wet. ;) They will also offer you either peppers, cheese or giardinera for it. I, of course ordered Giardinera.

The most obvious and most important characteristic of a great restaurant is great food. Great food does not have to be fancy or unique. Sometimes, the most ordinary food can become great simply by perfecting the recipe. \n The food at Windy City Beef and Dogs on West Lake Mead is great. Windy City specializes in Chicago style hot dogs. They are terrific and definitely worthy of a whole restaurant dedicated to them. But, if you dig a little deeper into their menu, you will find beef sandwiches, Reubens and the best cheeseburger in all of Las Vegas. While all their food is delicious, their cheeseburger will leave you excited for the next trip to Windy City.\n The cheeseburger is hot, juicy and perfectly seasoned. It is described on the menu as \"A Mouth Watering 100% All Beef Patty with Lettuce, Onions, Tomato & Pickles. Special Sauce Served on Sesame Seed Bun.\" All of these ingredients meld together to make the perfect cheeseburger. Each bite is a testament to the very invention of the cheeseburger. You will never be satisfied by another one again.\n Windy City also has many different kinds of specials. They have a calendar with a daily special. One of them is if you check into Facebook from the restaurant, you get a free bag of chips. There is also a board next to the front of the line that contains a couple of first names. If your name is on the board, and you can prove it is yours with identification, you get a free Chicago style hot dog. It is quite a bit of fun to check that board for your name. \n The third thing that makes Windy City really great is that it is family owned. In a day and age where mom and pop enterprises are no match for big box stores and chain restaurants, it is refreshing to find a family owned restaurant with good, honest food and decent prices.  \n Family owned restaurants are more customer friendly and the family that runs this restaurant are no exception. They are obviously happy to have their customers and treat them well. The cashier is always very friendly and so are the cooks. You can even sit at the bar and talk to them.\n So, the next time you are looking for a place to eat, bring your family down to meet the family at Windy City on West Lake Mead. Maybe your name will be on the board there and you can have a free hot dog in addition to your cheeseburger. If that isn't enough food for you, you can always order the double cheeseburger. \n Whatever you order, whether it be the dipped beef sandwich or the pizza puff, you will not be disappointed and you will probably have found your new standard dinner out.

When I unwrap this the bun is so damp and wet that it was stuck to the paper monstrosity they wrapped it in. I ended up tearing 1/4 of the bun off as to not eat paper. I take my first bite only to discover more atrocities lie in wait. The \"Italian beef\" is more like dehydrated beef so dry that when I took a piece I couldnt even fold a 1 inch piece without it crumbling apart. the au jus they gave me might as well of been water with some brown food dye in it to make it appear to be au jus.\n\nAll in all a pathetic excuse of a restaurant.

One sport pepper fell on the floor before my mouth could get to it, but the remaining one still packed enough punch for a normal pair.  My Chicago Dog was part of a #4 Windy City's Best of Both Worlds, which included a 3-inich Italian Beef Sandwich made with a Gonnella roll that was served soaked in a great homemade au jus.  The Italian Beef, made with thin, crumbly slices of cooked beef, was mild but very tasty.  And, skin-on fries were excellent.  But the extra Mozzarella Cheese ordered for Diane's Beef Dip was only half melted. \n\nBesides enjoying the food, I liked the atmosphere here of a no-nonsense Chi-Town sports-themed eatery, with Bulls, Blackhawks, Cubs, and White Sox banners hung on the walls.

The beef was pretty good for the most part, but the bread did not adsorb the liquid very well. I was honestly expecting this to taste a lot like Portillo's and unfortunately it did not. The bread really ruined the sandwich because it became really soggy. No, I did not wait to eat my sandwich it was already soggy by the time I got it. My friend who is from Chicago said the same thing, it's definitely a bread issue. He said they should have bread flown in from Chicago and that would do the trick, but realistically speaking that won't happen. I would suggest using Great Bun's French bread, but I don't know if that would be authentic Chicago style? But obviously the hoagie they are using now is not working.

I ordered a \"Pizza Puff\" combo priced at $4.50 plus 50 cents each for the addition of chili and cheese to the fries, onions were free. The pizza puff had cheese, sausage and sauce inside. It did taste ok. It reminded me of something you got for school lunch when you were younger, but in a very slightly better way. The basket of chili cheese fries is over $4 alone, so upgrading your combo with the addition of chili and cheese for just a buck makes it cheaper for the same size. The fries were good and the onions very fresh. The chili was not god though. I have had canned chili that tasted better. The basket of fries was a huge amount, but I really didn't eat but a few bites and then just couldn't eat anymore so a lot was wasted.

The Old West d\u00e9cor  / atmosphere and theme of everything was pretty cool. The best part it is this place really is old. The building that is now a bar and where you order food dates back to the 1800's. \n\nThey have an outdoor dance floor, corrals full of burros, rustic wagons, fire pits, and more. The trick is to go when the weather is nice because you sit outside at picnic tables. \n\nThe menu is also simple - burgers and dogs.  we ordered cheese burgers. They come with potato chips, no fries, but we didn't miss them. If you're tired of everyday fast food burgers and ready to try a GREAT!! TASTING!! old fashioned burger you got get it here. THIS REVIEW IS FOR THEIR BURGERS.\n\nInside the old bunkhouse which has been converted to a bar on one side the other side is where you go to a window and order. When we walked in to order there was a  \"heavenly aroma\" coming from the kitchen area. Burgers were cooking.   \n\nMy wife and I had a cheese burger with lettuce, tomato and onion and a pickle. It was huge. Their burger are a 1/2 pound and was cooked the way we wanted (medium). A little sloppy but oh so good. \n\nEverything that this glorious burger is made of is sheer perfection. They were truly a force to be reckoned with considering the burgers were a 1/2 a pound. Gets my stomach rumbling just thinking about it! The meat was tender, the burgers were melt-in-your-mouth with a generous helping of melted cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and onions. The bun was fresh, perfectly toasted with just the right amount of butter.  All the components worked together in perfect harmony even to the condiments. \n\nFOOD: The menu is simple. Very simple. You're here for two reasons, hamburgers or hot dogs. They do have a few other items on their menu (basic comfort food)  if you want something different you should probably go somewhere else.   AMBIANCE: Rustic atmosphere. If you have people visiting from out of town, you should take them here. Its a unique experience that everyone should know about! PRICE: Average. SERVICE: You order from a window in the bar. CONCLUSION: There can be crowds here at times, especially weekends. but don't let them intimidate you (this is good though, it means it is good to visit and for their food). There is plenty of seating and the cooks are quick! old west  rustic d\u00e9cor is great. Portions here are big.  I enjoyed this place -- food, price, service, atmosphere -- everything you'd want.  Highly recommended  RETURN  FACTOR: 100%. Don't even think, just go.

The sandwiches come with just meat, and if you want provolone, hot, or sweet peppers it will be $.60 extra per topping.

The beef was tender, and a generous heaping, but I would have liked some more flavor in the broth to bring an even greater dimension to the sandwich.

After 10 minutes of driving around trying to find a place to park, we got in.  There wasn't much of a line and we were able to order quickly.  Now, I'm not one to tell you how your food is made but when you say \"all we can do is hot dogs right now\" in response to my mother's request for a chipped ham slider - I'm not going to be upset.

Let me just start off by saying, if you want a REAL hot dog, this is definitely the place to be. When you come down Arizona Ave., you will see a \"Gourmet Hot Dogs\" sign a little south of Warner Rd. As you pull into the parking lot, don't be deterred when you notice the only thing there is an Antiques store. Pittsburgh Willy's is tucked into a little corner of the store (to the left when you walk in the front entrance). It is a small stand with a few tables nearby and Randy \"Pittsburgh Willy\" Walters, himself, behind the counter. This guy knows his hot dogs and is one of the friendliest people around. He makes conversation with everyone and provides one of the most relaxed, comfortable atmospheres you could imagine. I ordered the Freddie G., The Arizonan, and the Chili n' Cheese. And yes, I finished all three. All of the hot dogs were fantastic, with the delicious, all beef, 1/4 dogs. For a list of all the ingredients in each, see his website. The Arizonan is definitely one of the unique ones he has. The peppered bacon with some chilis provides a perfect contrast with the creamy, fresh guacamole for that fantastically unique taste. My favorite was definitely the Freddie G., the crunchy, french-fried onions, combined with what is probably the best Barbeque Sauce I have ever tasted (F.Y.I., this dog is named after the Barbeque sauce used). The sauce wasn't too strong, and was a perfect compliment to the all-beef dogs from cloud 9. The Chili n' Cheese can be ordered two ways; neat or sloppy. I ordered neat because he said the sloppy was much larger (more chili) and it was my third dog for the meal. After the dogs, my friend and I split the \"Ice-cream Sammich' Sundae\". The sunday was HUGE. I would recommend bringing a friend if you want to try it, as even Randy recommended we split one. The Sunday has an ice cream sandwich on the bottom, topped with peanuts, bananas, chocolate sauce, a large scoop of ice cream, and whipped cream. That was a delicious way to end the meal, with all of the ingredients working together in harmony, just as they did in the hot dogs.\n\nTo sum up, I will definitely be back here. I would say that the food was well worth the money, but that would be a lie, because it is worth FAR MORE (Don't tell Randy). I challenge you to try to find a better hot dog, and caution you to not hold your breath, because I have been searching for dogs like this for a long time.

Service-wise the owner is extremely friendly (5 stars) but my order took FOREVER (1 star). \n\nWhen I was little girl, a church in downtown Pittsburgh would have a Polish festival every year, and they would have little old Polish ladies make the pierogies. My dad would always bring home a boatload of them, and WOW were they delicious... thin dough, fat with potato stuffing, and DRIPPING with butter. The pierogies @ Willies looked more like raviolis to me, with very little stuffing and a whole lotta dough. Just not my cup of pierogie tea. \n\nHowever, they did have bbq chipped ham, which I haven't had since a kid. Most people haven't even heard of chipped ham, but I remember eating it when I was little. I got two orders of the sliders and they really were delicious... super salty, a little sweet and tangy. Just like when I was a kid and my parents didn't know any better. \n\nThe guy that runs the place is SUPER nice and we talked Pittsburgh for a while. TONS of Steelers & Pittsburgh memorabilia. He was running the stand on his own that day and he was busy, so it took a LONG time for him to get my order out.  Luckily the hot dog stand is housed within a giant antique store, so I was happy to look around until my order was up.  But had I just had to stand there and wait, I probably would have turned into one bitchy pregnant girl.\n\nOverall, I'm glad I tried it, but since it's about 20 minutes away from home, I don' think I'll be a frequent customer... but maybe if we're in the neighborhood sometime and I'm craving some barbecued chipped ham.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "So good!

They Serve my favorite meal of the day! BREAKFAST!!\nbut i am extremely picky when it comes to breakfast. I ordered a couple of things and still have yet to try everything else on the breakfast menu.  First I ordered the Big Victor, a green chili pork burrito with scrambled eggs and cheese! So here's the thing when i think of a breakfast burrito i think Big, Flavorful and scrambled and wrapped in a tortilla. Now when i took several bites i noticed that all the eggs were to one side,and the meat on another side. I love eggs and all but i need it to be in moderation to my meats and or veggies.  So when i took a bite of egg id have to take a small bite out of other corners for the cheese and meat. Sounds weird but that's just me i don't want to take a massive bite of the whole burrito stuffed in my mouth that's definitely not classy lady like behavior when you eat in front of people. So next time i order i will see if it can be scrambled to avoid the problem at hand for myself. Just like i did when i had difficulties eating the big willy mac and chili. Order it sloppy every time so its easier to eat. Situation Solved!  There is a habanero sauce that definitely gives it a little more kick with not too much bang as long as you do NOT drench the opening with the sauce.  \n\nFrench toast: definitely bread pudding style thick, crisp on the outsides slightly moist in the middle i am currently letting it drench in butter and syrup as i type this to see what impact that has.  When i make french toast or bread pudding i love letting it soak in the custards over night so its almost like eating something that melts in your mouth within seconds.  So after waiting a couple hours the syrup soaked in a little bit making it a little moister in the middle.  I dont care for hot syrup so i poured more syrup on. There is a flavor within the french toast that makes it different from others that is quite yummy. I was so spoiled with crackers and co french toast with its cinnamon roll type innards that randys french toast was something completely different but still good.\n\nI Still have yet to try the scrambles and the biscuits and gravy fresh and when i do i will edit this review and add it in. :)\n\n\n\nI", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Wanted to share that we had our 3 dozen perogies during our Thanksgiving feast and they were AWESOME!!!!\n\nThanks to Randy for an awesome job!\n\nLet's go STEELERS - LETS GO!", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Super friendly staff,even though there steeler fans.Haha.set inside the antique mall on Arizona ave and highland.small nice joint with really good all beef dogs,I got the suggested \"Frankie d\" with habenro bbg,on sesame bun,super good.I got a side of mac n cheese,because im a mac n cheese buff,it was basically kraft mac n cheese with a blend of different cheese dumped in w what seemed to be black pepper and cayenne pepper and butter residooo.I,ve made similiar version before.all in all,really good hotdog joint,I will return to try some other combos,they won me over,but im still a teds guy threw and threw.stay classy yelpers", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Most people know this place for the hotdogs, but they should also stop by on a Wednesday to have some pierogies!

I also ordered some spicy kielbasa to really excite my Polish-German tastebuds. \nWe went up to the register/counter to order and a can of pop was also included in the meal. I was so excited to see Vernors in the cooler! \nThe pierogies came out smothered in butter and onions and were boiled. The kielbasa was sliced on top. I dug in and was in heaven! Yum!

I've had a few different kinds in the past, and made them at pierogi-making parties using a ricotta or cottage cheese kind of filling versus yellow cheeses that were in these. Still good though. \nThe owner stopped by our table and was so gracious and welcoming.

I had tried some of the hot dogs with different toppings on them in different configurations over the years. I quickly came to the conclusion that for the most part, hot dog places in the Phoenix area pile on the toppings because the hot dog itself is not a good one. \n\nSince I was raised on plain ol hot dogs with minimal toppings I came to appreciate what a good quality dog was and what a poor quality dog was. In my book, if the underlying hot dog isn't good, then it doesn't matter what you pile on top, it's still a crappy dog. \n\nHence my hesitation on going into Pittsburgh Willy's. From the menu, it's clear that they specialize in unique dogs with a variety of toppings. \n\nI ordered the Pittsburgher, which was a 1/4lb all-beef dog, thinly sliced and chopped ham, cheese, and peppered bacon bits. Yes. That was all on the dog. \n\nVerdict? Pittsburgh Willy's uses a high quality, delicious dog underneath an equally high quality delicious layer of toppings. The ham was light, the bacon was just right, and the cheese just made sure it all stuck together while I leveraged this dog into my face hole. \n\nI would recommend this place to anyone who really loves a good dog and can get there during the hours. I would have rated this place 5 stars, but with the hours being fairly short it is difficult for me to get here with the exception of my day off, so 4 stars it is. Also, I think the place would benefit from a better, more obvious location, since as it is now it's a small part of a much larger antique store, and I never would have found it if it weren't for a referral from a friend.\n\nI will be back as often as I can.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "This place was highly recommended by a fiend of mine who patronizes this place regularly on his lunch break...

Delicious, fresh flavors and ingredients! The pork and veal was something different and wonderful. There is a sausage I love called Weisswurst (white Bavarian sausage made w/ veal and bacon) that it reminds me of. The sport peppers are a nice touch....I rarely see places have these and I should have asked for extra. \n\nThe BF got a beef dog in natural casing Streets of New York style which is a dog with red onion sauce,sauerkraut and mustard. Sauerkraut had still some crunch and the onion sauce with it made for something simple, but very nice. \n\nWe also shared beer batter fried green onions which came with a wasabi mayo. The mayo isn't spicy, it is lightly wasabi flavored and the batter on the beans was perfectly seasoned and crisp. FYI- If you get any entree, drink and appetizer they will count it as a \"combo\" and will take 10% off the total of those items. \n\nThey have Sprecher Root Beer (on draft not the soda machine).

And when I went to pick mine up, it kinda fell apart in my hand, and with each bite, the toppings fell off and the hot dog came through the bottom of the bun. We watched the guy make them, so we know they were not sitting for a while, but still yet, who likes a soggy bun? \n\nThe flavors of the peppers, pickle, tomato, onions, and green relish worked well together, the hot dog itself had a little snap to it, so I assume it was close to the real thing, however, I would try a different dog next time. As for the sides, the zucchini sticks were plentiful and had good crisp to them, but the chili on the fries did seem canned. \n\nFor a hot dog, this place was just okay. I'd try it again, just because of the variety on the menu.

Their hot dogs are tasty, the marinate sauce wasn't special, but was still good, the peppers are grilled, and the best part is the mozzarella sticks in it!

There aren't a lot of places set up this way so it makes it even more special! Their menu includes vegetarian dishes, beer brats cooked and marinated on the spot, a ton of different variances of their hot dog recipes! They also have sausages for the hot & spicy lovers out there. Their Italian fries are a basket OD garlic-y goodness! I highly recommend extra crisy shoestring fries! Perfect addition to any hot dog combination! I also tried their Vegas fries! This isn't for the light-hearted French fry lover; or even the heavy hearted (HIGH IN CALORIES, but good!) but if a friend orders them, grab a fork and grab a bite!

But for Great Links, I'll make the exception.\n\nWhen I was 17, I was having the time of my life running around Philly and Brooklyn.  I was on an extended vacation (months) visiting my relatives and was bouncing between the two cities. It was my first east coast experience, and it was incredible. What I remember the most was not the sights and the sounds, but it was the food. OMG the food...how I miss it.\n\nGreat Links is able to bring me a little slice of what I remember and loved most about Brooklyn and Philly. Another reviewer said it best: The moment you step inside the doors, you don't feel like you're in Vegas anymore. Suddenly you're in a casual, intimate little retro diner where you can place your order at the front, or grab a barstool at the counter and watch the cooks prepare your food. Heck, you're so close you could even chat with them - but I try not to, because they're busy cooking 20 things at once. For the east coast, these types of joints litter every street corner. For Vegas, it's not so common. It makes it all the more special.\n\nEveryone there is really nice. The cooks/grillmasters are awesome and very talented - I can't seem to cook more than one thing at a time without burning it all on MY stove, so how they manage to do it so well is beyond me. They chat to the customers when they can, and make sure that you're doing ok. The servers are also friendly and attentive. I've even met the owner, and he's a very personable guy. And he works hard too, because I've watched him bus tables when it gets really busy. I've never seen a owner do dirty work at any other restaurant, so he has my respect.\n\nThe menu is extensive and delicious.The portions are huge and extremely affordable. They have more than hot dogs for those not in the mood, as well as salads for those of you that are a little more health-conscious (I am not one of those people). They have a breakfast menu that I'd like to try someday - if I can ever convince myself to wake up before noon on my days off.\n\nIn addition to the food, they have the usual soft drinks, milk shakes, malt beverages, bottled beer, and even some beer on tap. Never have tried a milkshake, because I usually get filled up on my entree, but they look good, and I am tempted.\n\nDuring lunch rush hour, expect to wait a little bit longer for your food. This is not a slam against the restaurant - everything is prepared fresh, and it gets seriously busy. I don't mind waiting the extra few minutes for good food. I believe you can call ahead and place a to-go order - so if you're short on time and not dining in, this might be a better way to go.\n\nI can't say enough good things. I am a happy customer, and I'm pretty picky about where I spend my money.

Finally, instead of fighting the urge any longer, I thought, \"Why not?  Let's do it!\"  Diane agreed, and just like that we detoured to Jones and Craig where my favorite LV Valley hot dog joint awaited.  It was all very spontaneous, and the anticipation of biting into the natural casing of an authentic Chi Town Dog was palpable.\n\nI smiled as I saw the familiar grinning hot dog reclining in a bun painted on a window next to the restaurant entrance, and felt like I was being personally greeted and welcomed back.  Inside, I contemplated if one dog was enough, and since it never was before, ordered a Kraut Dog to go with a Chicago beauty, plus an order of Natural Fries.  Diane selected a Cheese Dog and Cheese Fries.  And, we both asked for a glass of the very smooth and tasty Schrecher Draft Root Beer that is always on tap.\n\nWhen the food arrived quicker than I thought it would, my Chicago Dog looked like it was specially made to coincide with the Christmas season upon us.  Besides a juicy reddish all-beef Boar's Head hot dog in a natural casing that audibly snaps when bitten into, the soft and supple steamed poppy seed bun contained excellent tasting emerald-green relish, a bright red slice of fresh tomato, white diced onions, a green kosher dill pickle spear, two small yellow sport peppers, yellow mustard, and celery salt.  I did not besmirch this divine creation with ketchup, for which indiscretion Chicago natives would have undoubtedly chased me out of the windy city on a rail had I been there.  And, need I say that this hot dog tasted as good as it looked!  Well, it surely did, and was quickly dispatched.     \n\nThank goodness I had the Kraut Dog waiting as a second course.  Spicy mustard is available but I chose mild yellow mustard, and the warm, white sauerkraut blanketing another all-beef dog had just the right amount of crunch and liquidity.  I gobbled up this more simply designed frank even faster than the Chicago cousin that preceded it.  All the while I enjoyed my generous helping of skin-on fresh Natural Fries.  They were just as good naked as doused with ketchup.  So, conflicted a bit on which way to go, at length I opted for half one way and half the other.\n\nMeanwhile Diane very much enjoyed her Cheese Dog with an all-beef dog ensconced in melted Cheddar Cheese, and Cheese Fries that were Natural Fries covered with a mild and warm Cheese Sauce.  They were very good; I know because I consumed a Cheese Sauce-laden fry myself for the sake of this review.  Ah, the sacrifices I sometimes make in the name of authentic reviewing!  The smooth draught root beer washed down everything quite well, and we left in very good spirits.\n\nService by Michelle and the two grill cooks was friendly and efficient, and, despite fairly heavy traffic, the restaurant was clean and picked up quite well.

The only negative item to report was so minor it is hardly worthy of mention.  The salt shaker on our table was out of salt.  I quickly snatched a filled one from an adjoining table without even having to get up from my seat, and this slight and very short inconvenience was resolved.\n\nFunny thing is though, I could go back tomorrow and repeat the process all over again.

So far my favorites are the NASCAR specials (I really wish they would still serve last year's special though) and their Italian fries.

I mean in addition to hot dogs, you have burgers, sammys, a selection various fried items smothered with a different toppings and salads. And for you vegetarians out there, they have a mighty fine selection of veggie kielbasa, bratwurst, italian sausage, hamburgers. I've never heard of veggie kielbasa, but I thought that was a pretty brilliant thing.\n\nPersonally, being of the meat eating persuasion, I ordered myself a grilled chicken salad. Yeah boring I know. But honestly, my company was instituting this whole exercise/eat right initiative and I felt obligated to participate. (I have since fallen off the bandwagon.) Really at a place like this, I wasn't really expecting much because it is a burger/hot dog joint after all. I was surprised though. Although it's romaine, it's clearly freshly chopped (note, none of that early brownish tinge you get when it's been cut a long time ago) with other veggies.They have a very simple oil and vinegar dressing that hit the spot. Plus, the chicken was plentiful and moist. For less than $7, it's far superior to many grilled chicken salad in the same price range.\n\nThe hubs couldn't help but try their artisan root beer. For us soda drinkers, it's got that real root beer-ish, herbacious flavouring (in an absolutely good way) that brought us back to the good ol' days. A must try!\n\nNot being on a company diet, the hubs has had the rueben, their KC Masterpiece Nascar special featuring Boarshead sausage, their italian sausage and side orders of their fried zucchini, regular shoestring fries and freshly cut french fries. Their reuben was pretty great while the KC Masterpiece Nascar special was a little overwhelming with all the cheese, BBQ sauce on it - it kind of detracted from the flavours of the sausage. Regardless, their plainer renditions fare better - the casings got a nice snap to it.\n\nThe sides were a hit or miss. The fried zucchini's batter was a little too heavy and fell apart when you picked it up. Their fresh cut fries don't have quite the crispiness that I look for in a french fry. I prefer their shoestring fries which were much crispier and lighter -- FYI - their shoesting is more the size of your standard McDonald's french fries. \n\nOverall, given the price, I would definitely recommend this place for a good tuck in of hot dogs and root beer (4).", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 4, "useful": 7, "cool": 7}}, {"text": "I'd NEVER been to a place specialising in hot dogs and wouldn't even think to order a hamburger!

I know everyone has their own opinions, including me, but out of the 70+ burger places I've eaten at in town I'd say 95% of them are better than this. Who the hell voted? What other places was this up against? Come on!\n\nThe restaurant interior is typical strip mall fare, with the griddle and deep fryers right in the open. The menu features hot dogs, sausages, burgers, sandwiches, fish...you name it. The key words to this menu are: frozen, premade, generic, and Boar's Head. Think generic pre-packed sausages and dogs, frozen patties, frozen fries... Sitting at the counter by the griddle I witnessed them pulling their sausages out of Boar's Head packages, frozen patties thrown right on the griddle, generic frozen crinkle cut fries dumped right out of their plain grocery store bags into a measuring bowl and into the fryer. While sitting near the griddle the only 'fresh' items I noticed were the pre-cut veggies they were pulling out of the fridge to throw on the griddle.\n\nMy frozen burger patty was dropped right on the grill to be overcooked with everything else on there. The meat was very generic, not that flavorful, and definitely not the winner of any 'best of' contest I can think of. There was a huge piece of tough, thick lettuce on the burger, a small amount of mushrooms I could barely taste, well-melted swiss cheese and a couple of thin tomato slices. The bun was grilled well, but extremely plain and non-existent. Nothing about this burger stood out, other than the fact I could find it in any backyard bbq or at an overpriced crappy food stand at any sports event.\n\nThe thin, overcooked generic fries were exactly that. I can't stress how ridiculously typical this meal was; I would give it a fairly negative review just on all that, but combine it with the 'best burger' claim and it infuriates me. To top it off my meal came to $13.26, which is equal to or more than plenty of other fantastic burgers I've eaten all around town that are definitely worthy of some best burger claims in many categories.

I remember seeing some stuff about this contest on Fox 5 and John Curtas was one of the guest judges, so I figured it had some clout behind it.  I asked the waitress about it because I wanted to order the EXACT burger that won, and she was actually very upfront about how the contest was set up, and that it did have exclusions (I don't believe my current favorite Bachi was able to be represented due to cost, same with Burger Bar)   Hmmmm, doubt already started setting in.   Turns out the burger that won that contest was the Jalapeno Guacamole burger, which turned out to be the one that I was most interested in anyhow, bonus!  Cayenne Mayo, Tomato, Grilled onions and jalapenos, pepperjack cheese, and an onion ring filled with guac.  Yeah, sign me up!   \n\nMy friend and I decided to share a side, and while I pushed for one of the actual french fry concoctions, he asked if I wanted to share the Frito Pie.  Uh, I guess.  When the food arrived (after a few beers, naturally), the burger looked impressive.  I'm all about saving the best for last though so I tackled the Frito Pie first.  Eh, tasted just like Frito Pie.  I guess I shouldn't knock it since it tasted exactly what a Frito Pie should taste like, but I was hoping for a bit of ingenuity or something that might set it apart.  After cursing my friend for twisting my arm into ordering that and not one of their fry options, I bit into the burger.  I got exactly what I expected and wanted out of it:  greasy, flavorful, and messy.  I felt like a star of a Carl's Jr commercial, except not nearly as hot.

Not a wisp of pink meat in sight!  I understand that because of eColi concerns, many establishments now flatly refuse to prepare medium rare or rare hamburgers.  And, that is fine with me, so long as a server alerts me of that policy as soon as I request a less than well-cooked burger.  Then, if so inclined, I can order something else.  But it is galling to have the staff play along with a \"medium rare\" request, and pretend that a wish for a pink burger has been fulfilled when it plainly has not been.  The fry cook is certainly not going to fool a patron who is already asking for medium rare doneness by instead delivering a meat patty that is dark brown through and through.   \n\nAt least my burger was juicy, and although mushrooms were sparse, the Swiss Cheese was well melted and the bun nicely warmed.

They put so much olive oil on his fries that when he was done eating them, there had to be at least a half a cup of oil in the bottom of his dish, they put way too much oil on them... he was very disappointed with both the sausage and the fries that he ordered... when we first got there he asked them to turn the tv down, we were really close to it, and they turned it down one... they have two tvs in there and my husband and I were the only customers in there at the time he asked them to turn it down, so that just wasn't right of them... when we first walked in and the waitress came and took our order I noticed she had gloves on, I was thinking that was good.. If I had realized that they don't change their gloves in between orders.. (they didn't that day while we were there) we would have asked them to change them. The guy that was working was walking around running his hands along the counters and knocking on the counters and touching it seemed everything then he didn't change his gloves when other people came in there... she didn't either.

Yelp rarely fails me but this was one of those times where it fell short of expectations. \n\nIs there a good-ole-boy system at this place? All I heard the owner talking about was their award winning burgers to whom I supposed are the regulars. My wife, daughter and I were the only people under the age of 50 there, so perhaps that explains why their food was so bland and flavorless. \n\nI ordered the pastrami, which was cooked really well. However, there was little taste. I have tried pastrami from dozens of restaurants and this was bottom-of-the-barrell in terms of taste. \n\nMy wife ordered grilled cheese, which is impossible to screw up unless you're 4 years old or completely inept. It was solid, but she ordered it with bacon and bacon saves everything. The bread was alright, but seemed store-bought. \n\nMy daughter ordered chicken nuggets and she said they were disgusting. I looked at them and they appeared to be the type you buy from a frozen food section. \n\nWe shared fries, which apparently do not come with any sort of salt or seasoning. \n\nTo be fair, the waitresses there were super friendly and on top of their game.

He also missed a kid run into the restaurant, grab two soda cups, fill them and leave without paying. All because he was too busy bragging about his food to the NASCAR crowd that was infesting this place. \n\nOne of the cooks also took the time to venture into the diner and talk about the burger competition they had previously won. he oddly went out of his way to state that \"I don't think they'll want us back next year. Not that we're cheating but...\" and I didn't catch the end. \n\nOverall, I was pretty disappointed with this place considering the positive reviews on yelp. I will eventually give this place another chance to redeem itself and, if it isn't able to, I'll suspect that they are asking friends and family to circumvent the yelp reviews. \n\nEither that or they rarely get anyone who isn't an AARP member and can actually handle salt and seasoning.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "This.

I was so fascinated in all the offerings they have that I forgot all about my hot dog craving and went with a sausage sandwich instead.  It was a toss up between the Roasted Garlic and Mozzarela or the Spinach and Asiago Cheese.  The Spinach and Asiago is topped with mustard, mayo, tomato, pickles, relish and sport peppers not unlike a Chicago style hot dog.  It sounded damn good as a Chicago style dog is my favorite.

A perfectly grilled chicken sausage stuffed with cheese and mushrooms then topped with grilled onion, bell peppers and mushrooms with the addition on marinara on top of that.

My husband really enjoys Smashburger's French fries since they are crispy and made with rosemary. Since he decided to order these, I decided to try a chocolate malt shake. There were two employees working the register, a male and a female. Only two customers in front of us, and slowly a line behind us started to form. The male employee finished taking a customer's order, but quickly answered the phone. The female employee helped the customer's in front of us, and since the male employee was still on the phone, she then took our order. She was nice and helpful and since our order was to-go, she told us we could wait nearby. By the time we sat down, the male employee left and only the female employee was taking orders. The line got longer and longer and she was left alone to man the registers the entire time.\n\nIt took about 15 minutes to get our fries and shake. The shake didn't look or taste like chocolate and there was no malt flavor whatsoever. I made my husband taste it and he agreed. I went back in to make sure I received the correct shake. The female employee who made my shake immediately and defensively told me she put malt in it. I asked if she could add more, since I couldn't taste it. She took my shake, dumped the entire thing (whipped cream and all) into a metal shake container, put more malt and chocolate sauce in it, and then mixed it up. In the end, it was slightly (only slightly) more chocolately, but still no discernible malt flavor and now it wasn't thick but very thin. For $4, the shake was not worth it and my husband agreed. Culver's or even Which Wich makes much better chocolate malt shakes.\n\nOverall, I would not order a shake from here ever again. My husband enjoyed his fries, but if we had to wait in that long line (where only one employee was at the registers) to order fries, I'd skip it.

That's fine, it was probably a long night for them; the lady in front of us sweared she handed them a $20, and the cashier gave her  $1 in change, who knows the customer seemed shady herself...ANYWAYS....they corrected my order and now we're good again...\n\nIt tasted like they cooked the fries in a month old oil for 14 hours; the fries we're horrible!!  Let me remind you I'm not picky, it was just that bad!  The hot dog, the runny cheese even the bacon!  I thought I could just pick off the bacon but that too was apparently fried in the same vat. So much for a quick bite to eat.  I've never been able to make myself throw up, and that day I WISHED I was bulimic.

O.A.R. started the evening off right! Such a great show and full of energy, energy that built up my appetite. Between shows, my friends and I decided to walk the Linq and check out Haute Doggery for bite to eat. \n\nFirst off, when you hear the name Haute Doggery, you think gourmet. You think, wow, that's a cool spin to a hot dog. That's what originally caught our curiosity. Hot dogs are an American classic. When there's a spin like that, you can't help but walk in and try them out! Walking into the place, you notice the bright accents around the room. White table tops, wooden trimmings and bright red chairs. The focal point to the place is the hot dog artwork to the back of the room. I thought at first sight, this place looked awesome! Then it was time to order.\n\nTHE BIGGEST, and I mean the biggest turn off for me are non engaged employees. When I walked up to the counter, the lady taking our order was texting on her cell phone! Clear as day, it looked like she was hiding from her coworkers, but didn't care about doing that in front of her customers. I took a picture and posted it onto the business page for proof. If you zoom into the picture, she wasn't texting anything professional. The conversation via text was about some drama. WHAT. A. TURN. OFF. That should NEVER happen. Unacceptable. She let me stand there for a good 30 seconds before saying something. When she did, she said, \"Don't worry, I can hear you. Go ahead and order,\" WHILE SHE CONTINUED TO TEXT. Ugh, I'm sorry for the rant, I just felt cheap and unimportant at that moment. Not good for this business. That may be the reason why they just opened in the Linq and so far have an overall Yelp score of 2.5 stars. \n\nAside from that, here's what I got for my meal:\n\n-Crinkle Cut French Fries for $3.99: the big disappointment with these fries that they weren't fresh cut fries. If the business is going to advertise themselves as a step up from the normal hot dog joint, well then I would expect them to have stellar, fresh cut ingredients. \n\n-Tijuana Dog for $7.29: When I did get the opportunity to talk with the hostess, I asked her between this dog and the Gold Standard dog (advertised on their business page on TheLinq.com. She told me hands down, this dog. This dog was bacon wrapped and deep fried, topped with grilled onions, jalapeno and mayo. The jalapenos weren't overly hot and coupled with the onions, it brought a nice crunchy texture. One of my favorite guilty pleasures is eating a hot dog with mayo. This was no different and super delicious! Although the hot dog was bacon wrapped, which I LOVED, the dog was super small. It had a nice snap to it, but unfortunately for me, it got lost in the mix of ingredients and wasn't the true star of the show. \n\nThe word Haute means, \"fashionably elegant or high-class,\" depicted by Websters. This place was inspired by the famous Holstein's menu and to me, a huge disappointment. I appreciate their overall take on the American classic.

At two-fifty each, a pair of them make a five-dollar lunch that'll satisfy most light to normal appetites.  The downside?

She told me I didn't order one, and then had to check her hand written receipts against the cash register's because she probably didn't believe me, and 15 minutes later, she found it, and then asked me if I still wanted it.

One of the places suggested was \"Jimmy's Hot Dogs\" which serves Chicago style hot dogs and within a few days I had made my way there. I pulled up to a non-descript looking building and sure enough Jimmy's was there with Vienna Beef umbrella's out and visible. \n\nI walked in and decided to go for a hot dog and fries. I took a few pictures of the place on the inside and headed back to the table to actually sample the hot dog here. I ordered a hot dog with everything, fries and a cup of water. A few minutes later my order was up and it was time to try it.\n\nThe bun here was a classic poppy seed bun as often found on Chicago style hot dogs. The bun was mostly soft with a few of the edges being a bit dry. The relish was of the neon green variety and was applied a little too heavily. The onion was chopped and applied nicely to the dog. The mustard was well applied as well, two thin slices of tomato were at the bottom. A thin pickle slice at the top and a pair of sport peppers were on the dog as well. The sausage used here was the classic Vienna beef natural casing and was properly heated up. The overall taste of the dog was excellent. The bun on the edges was a little more dry than I would prefer and the relish was applied a bit too excessively, but overall this tasted excellent and is a great representation of a Chicago style hot dog for people in Phoenix to try.\n\nThe fries wrapped with the hot dog were \"fresh cut fries\". Over the past decade or so these have become extremely popular with hot dog vendors in Chicago. The good news is these taste like authentic Chicago style fresh cut fries, the bad news is as in Chicagoland, these are usually hit or miss and these were about average for ones found around Chicago. They weren't too greasy but they were a bit on the bland side. I didn't finish off the fries, but I will say these were a lot like what many places in Chicago serve.\n\nOverall for a Chicago-Style restaurant 1500 miles away, Jimmy's Hot Dogs easily exceeded my expectations. I'd highly recommend this place if you want a good example of what a Chicago style hot dog should taste like in Arizona.

The shop from the outside gives you the vibe of how the inside is. Straight up burger and fries joint. They don't mess around with some fancy menu. You've got maybe 5 or 6 burgers to choose from, so it's not to hard to decide which one you want to try first. I got the burger on sour dough combo, and my husband got the double burger combo. We decided to eat there on the stools and bar they have set up. It's a tiny little shop with about 10 stools to eat at, all facing the windows outside. You can expect to pay anywhere from 5-8 a combo, which is about what any fast food joint charges. We got our food and were hungry. I grabbed my burger and bit in. It was nice and juicy. The patty wasn't overwhelmingly big, but had a lot of grilled flavor to it. Along with my burger I got a nice huge helping of thick fries, and a large soda. The fries were perfectly hard on the outside and soft on the inside, just like I enjoy them. My husbands burger looked good too, he said it tasted yummy too. While we were in there we noticed a young crowd come in and out, for a Monday I saw they did pretty good business. Which surprised me because I noticed a note on the door saying they were no longer going to be open on Sundays.. Awhh, I thought. I hope they survive this tough economy, it's got to be hard being a burger shop right across the street from jack in the box, and burger king.

The burgers are still grilled right in front of you and you get to watch them season them live as well.  They also still have a lot of options for hamburgers but they're nothing you haven't seen before.  BBQ sauce, thousand island, ketchup and mustard.  All the old standards.  Unfortunately my favorite burger, the ranch burger, is the biggest flavor change at the place.  The ranch/mayo sauce used to run down my fingers and drip onto my burger paper leaving behind tasty little puddles of fattening bliss.  Now there's much less sauce, and it seems thin and watery.  As far as their hot dogs go...well I've never had the hot dogs in all the years I've been dining here, but my friends won't order anything else.  They love the chili dogs like a dog loves a bone.  \n\nIt's still a good flame-broiled burger, and the fries are still amazing.

Are your brains so addled by the sun that you've forgotten what food tastes like, or is this just a symptom of the terrible offerings of Phoenix as a city?  I'm not sure yet.\nLenny's is one of these cases.  I went in here expecting a home run from reading all these reviews, and I splurged and got onion rings and a shake based purely on your recommendations.  Sure, it was a well-put-together burger, and the options they have are fairly novel... but it was just okay.  The toppings were kind of meh, especially the onions.  But most importantly, the burger was extremely salty.  I believe I saw them putting some sort of powdered topping on them on the grill, which, fine, but... less please.  The saltiness really took the quality of the burger down for me.  Otherwise it would have been much more solid.  The saltiness alone reduces the chance of me returning.\nService was fast, that's a plus.  It's true the location offers you little.  It's functional.  It's fine.  Whatever.  But the onion rings were frozen (so are the fries) and the blandest I've ever had in my life, so the guy below who said they were the best he ever had, well, I hope you get to have some better onion rings soon.

But Lenny's lived up to that and more today.  \n\nYou just can't beat how small and packed it gets.  People lined up out the door around noon each day, waiting for their food, barely being able to keep up with the filling of drinks and ketchup cups.

They had TONS of different brands and flavors of sodas to choose from. I chose a Mason's root beer in a super cute glass bottle, and the boy chose Pepsi (boo - boring choice!).\n\nIt took less than 5 minutes for our food to be brought out to us. The sub? Amazingly toasted goodness - eat your heart out, Quizno's! My hot dog and fries were also awesome. The fries were well seasoned and crunchy, the hot dog made perfectly to order. :)\n\nThe owner swung by our table and asked how everything was (awesome, thanks!) and he also shared that starting next week they will be serving hamburgers and cheeseburgers.\n\nOverall, the food was awesome, the selection of drinks was great, and we will be back for more.\n\nLast, but certainly not least - the price?

Rocket Burger and Subs serves up huge sandwiches and fried delights for astonishingly low prices, and much of the food is home-made. There's also an enormous section of unusual soft drinks; for instance, there's over two dozen brands of root beer to choose from. Dennis, one of the owners worked for A&W for 8 years, so he probably has root beer running through his veins by now. \n\n     I saw Rocket Burger in a listing of new valley eateries, then did a little research. The reviews I saw were all stellar, so I knew we had to give it a try. It doesn't look like much, inside or out - it's in a little strip mall tucked behind Churches Chicken at 35th Ave. and Cactus. But it's clean, and everybody is helpful and pleasant. Ken gave a happy whoop when he saw Cheese Curds ($2.49/$4.49) on the menu. We decided to get an order while waiting for our friends Randy and Marty to join us. The curds came quickly out of the kitchen, piping hot, served with some tasty homemade marinara. They were a touch greasy, as they should be, and the oil was fresh. Marty and Randy arrived in time to save us from ourselves by helping to finish off the curds. Then we took a while trying to make our selections from the extensive menu. Eventually Randy and I both went for the New Yorker: pastrami with homemade slaw and thousand island dressing ($2.99, $3.99 or $4.99). Ken had a homemade-meatball  sub, with more of that good marinara and some provolone. It was the same price structure as our New Yorkers and all the rest of the entries under Classic Subs and Sandwiches. Marty went with a double burger ($3.89, the singles are $1 less). He could have opted for a Rocket Burger - !0 inch sub with three burgers and the fixings in either plain, cheese, bacon, teriyaki, or chili style ($4.99 to $5.99). Of course we had to try the fries and onion rings.\n\n     Again our food arrived quickly, served in plastic baskets. It became very quiet, except for the occasional growl of pleasure. The onion rings ($1.99) had been dipped in a thin cornmeal batter which made them nice and crunchy.  The handcut fries ($1.49) were skinny, the way I like them. Randy thought they were undersalted, but I thought they were fine - our usual disagreement. At any rate, they disappeared quickly. Unlike the sandwiches. They were so big that we all ended up taking half of each sub home. The slaw on the New Yorkers was delicious, as was my whole wheat sub roll. The meat balls were nice and tender, and there was plenty of cheese on top. Randy had found a bottle of ginger beer imported from Australia that had a wonderfully refreshing true ginger taste. There seemed to be actual pieces of ginger in it - instructions on the label said to invert the bottle before opening. It never did tell you to turn it right side up again - the Aussies give us more credit than we deserve. \n\n     Other food items available: Hebrew National hot dogs in several styles ($2.49), Pizza  \nBread with various toppings, Gyros ($3.69), salads ($1.99 - $3.99), a fish sandwich ($2.49) served with homemade tartar sauce.

I picked one that tasted like a mojito. My daughter had a pear soda, and my youngest had a delicious rootbeer that had butterscotch in it. The coleslaw on the NYer was great!

Like how we mentioned to the owners how cool it would be if they offered ice cream, only to find a whole slew of ice cream treats we never would've dreamed of a month later.  Like how I mentioned that I missed the Flathead Lake Blueberry Pomegranate soda (I wanted to try it in a float now that they had ice cream), and I came in 2 days later to find new ones in the freezer and a full case on the rack.  Or the time my girlfriend and I just stopped and stared at each other after our first bites of our Red, White and Blue Special burgers on the 4th of July.

All of the burgers are incredible, but my personal favorites are the Philly Burger, The Afterburner, Teriyaki Burger, Steak Burger, and the Red,White & Blue Burger.

I'm halfway through trying them all and picking a favorite just depends on my mood, none have disappointed me.  Same goes for the hot dogs.\n\nThe sides are perfect as well.  Aside from the MOST ADDICTIVE FRIES AND RANCH IN THE WORLD, they also have cheese curds, pizza bread, OVER 300 SODAS, SLUSH PUPPIES, and one-of-a-kind treats like PECAN PIE SHAKES!!!

It's all refrigerated and ready to drink!\nPro: They have a Santa Fe Burger which involves a battered, deep-fried green chili which is utter genius. I repeat, Utter Genius.\nPro: The burgers are well-crafted with attention to detail and carefully laid out, not assembled by an uncaring worker and squished into a wrapper quickly.\nPro: They have Pepsi products on fountain in case for some reason ~300 types of bottled soda (most made with Real Cane Sugar OH YEAH) just doesn't do it for you and you need to blend your own suicide-soda.\nPro: They will make any soda you want into a float, using soft-serve, for a buck!\nPro: Locally-owned by a guy who seems pretty nice and genuinely interested in his customers and their thoughts. That's a HUGE PLUS, people...pay attention! \nPro: The burgers' pickles are good! they don't taste like run-of-the-mill, cheap, food purveyor 5 gallon bucket pickles.\nPro: They have a website that seems to be pretty current, it alerted me to the fact that they have some of the last remaining Dublin Dr. Pepper in the world and I should buy now. (Disclosure: While I like Dr. Pepper - I'm not a superfan, and have never tried it - so I figured the $15/6packs were better left to the superfans and collectors).\nPro: The building seems to be laid out in an \"L\" fashion, with the soda selection and main tables on one side; and an 'extra\" area of seating on the other side of the kitchen that seems to have a pass-thru ordering window. That probably comes in pretty handy during lunch rush when the kids from the hi-skool next door probably mob the place. We didn't notice this until we were leaving...so I'll have to explore that next time.\n\nCon: The signs telling you about the $1 float options are too high to notice until you've already ordered. Perhaps this is another stroke of genius to encourage repeat business, perhaps its an oversight.\nCon: It's an older property, so it doesn't have that super-clean feeling about it. It's not dirty by any means...but it's at that stage of life where its not sterile, but not quite yet charming. Of course, this whole part of town is at that stage - so you can't really hold that against the place.\nCon: Soft-serve rather than real ice cream.  It's not that I hate soft-serve, I give it its credit...but I prefer real ice cream. (Disclosure: if they used real ice cream, I'd probably bitch about that too, because I'm kind of a dairy snob).\nCon: Shoestring potatoes. I know they have the skin on, and are natural-cut, and shoestrings have millions of loyal followers...I'm not one of them. Give me a tater-tot any day.\n\nOther things of note: My single burger was BIG. You can also go double or Rocket Burger, which is 3 patties on a sub roll. I can't imagine eating that - but I'm sure its a fave amongst many!\n\nBottom line: Pros obviously outweigh cons and the fact that it is a family-owned/run business always weights positive in my book!

In fact if there wasn't it sure seemed like there was and I just didn't care for it at all. But everything else about the burger was fine.  The burger was good, the bun was different than you normally get a burger on, it tasted good and was hot. I agreed with my grandson though it was noting to write home about. My wife and grandson also commented on how they weren't really impressed with their fries, but I have to say my onion rings were deeeeeelicious!!! \n\nBottom line: Better than Rocket Burger is better than any fast food place. I guess I just expected a little more especially after reading the reviews. \n\n                   So I will have to give them another try \n\nFOOD: NO wow factor or anything, however they are  better than any fast food place. PRICE: The prices are reasonable. SERVICE: The guy at the counter was nice and polite. AMBIENCE:  Looked more like a convenient store than a restaurant. CONCLUSION: Two Words: SODA SHOP The selection is intense. Best I've seen in years. Great selection of small batch brews.

I was a little apprehensive about coming just because of the proximity to Moon Valley High School (it's literally next door).  Lunch + Friday + high school conjures up images of when I and hoards of classmates used to go to our favorite lunch spots with friends during high school.  Worse yet, the place is in a tiny old strip mall with almost no parking.\n\nShockingly, the place wasn't busy at all and I easily got a parking spot.  When you walk in you almost feel like you've stumbled upon an old convenience store as you immediately notice the soda machines, the large refrigerator area full of soda, and even the soda six packs on the shelves.  Notice a theme here?  Yeah, they've got A LOT of soda.  In fact they claim to have the widest variety of sodas to choose from in the state.  As in the entire state of Arizona!  I have no way of verifying this claim, but I did indeed see many soda brands and flavors I had never seen before from chocolate to watermelon, to lemon, and on and on.  If you're a soda junkie, you'll be in heaven here.\n\nBut I came for one reason, the burgers.  They actually have a variety of hot dogs, gyros, and submarine sandwiches as well, but its Rocket \"Burger\".  I saw one person eating a Rocket sized burger which is insanely huge (basically a submarine burger sandwich with at least 4 patties by my count).  I wasn't feeling that bold so I went with a bacon double cheeseburger instead and got a side of fries.  The burger was excellent.  Hearty portion with plenty of cheese and bacon and their special sauce (basically a rendition of thousand island from what I could tell).  The fries were pretty average so nothing special there.  All totaled, the burger, fries and a drink were $8.  The dining area is pretty small with tables, chairs and a couple of booth.  But like I said, it wasn't crowded and I was easily able to get a seat.  I was in and out in about 20 minutes\n\nOverall, a pretty cool place and certainly unique to the west side of town.

This very much refers to yesterday's meal I had at Tommy's, which was less than ideal and left my stomach a bit unhappy. There's clearly no suspense in this review but I'll go ahead and give you my full rundown anyway.\n\nAt this point I have pretty much vowed to stick to stand-alone joints, one of a kind locations that are unique to Vegas, to go against my plan and try this place anyway was my mistake. Sure I've reviewed In-N-Out and a few other small regional chains, but no more. I had high hopes yesterday of finding some underground spot to try, but my initial plans fell through when after doing a bit of research I found out that the kitchen at a local dive bar had closed and they were no longer serving food. Trying to stick to a location somewhat near my office, I instead went with the recommendation of my coworker for Tommy's because he had mentioned it a few times and it was right around the corner. Much like my mistake with going back to Five Guys due to the convenience, this was not good.\n\nThere are only two locations in Vegas, the one I went to is right next to St Rose Hospital, and is in a very desolate looking parking lot. There were maybe three people when I went inside, the clientele looked very much like the folks I mentioned in my Farmer Boys article. The interior d\u00e9cor was a cross between a very cheap In-N-Out and A&W. I didn't really do any research on their website before going over there which was a bad idea, because as soon as I walked in and saw the images of their burgers with the descriptions of their chili I knew this was bad. But I was already standing at the counter so it was too late to turn back.\n\nI ordered the single chili cheeseburger meal, complete with all the toppings: tomato, pickles, mustard, onions and chili. After waiting almost 10 minutes for my number to be called for some reason, I sat down ready to dig in. The meal looked completely uninspired and generic, just as any fast food burger should. And this is exactly where the problem lies; I am supposed to be blogging about great, unique gourmet burgers, not sitting at a generic garbage fast food chain! The bun was plain, starchy, and about as typical as they come. The patty itself wasn't too bad, but the awful chili took away any sort of flavor from the rest of the burger. I really don't think I need to get into much detail here like I usually do; this is just a gross fast food chili burger, plain and simple. But yes, I finished it anyway.\n\nThe fries were also as typical as they could be, frozen generic steak fries that were barely at room temperature. I do have one positive thing to say though; my iced tea was ok. The other awesome redeeming factor of this meal is that I got this awesome picture of what looks like a skid mark left by my burger.\n\nI can't reiterate enough; this blog is to review unique, quality burgers in Las Vegas. When I started the blog I immediately swore off McDonald's, Burger King and the like, so to even venture into this place was counter-productive. And because this was so bad, now I have to go out and eat a second burger this week to hopefully get a somewhat more decent review posted.

For years it seemed like the only option there really was for cheap and quick meals in neighborhoods were fast food chains you could find anywhere else. Thank god people have finally started \"demanding\" not so hoity-toity places and the supply is rolling in. Buldogis is one of the latest additions to what's possibly the first local trend or \"Las Vegas reinvention\" in 10 years that's actually doing some good in my humble opinion.\n\nThe prices may throw one for a loop at first. I can testify to that. $5 for a hot dog is not my cup of tea, thankfully, there were pictures on display all over the restaurant. When it comes to hot dogs, I usually need at least two to fill me up. These didn't look like your ordinary hot dogs, at all, so I figured one would suffice. Wise choice on my behalf. \n\nI didn't want to get something TOO wild, it was only my first time here after all. I ordered a naked dog with caramelized onions, pork belly bacon, cheese and mustard with classic fries and a drink. Total: 8.86. Not bad. \n\nI was given a small sample cup of their chili while waiting for my food. It was courtesy of the chef since it was my first time here. At this point I was already beginning to fall in love with the place. The chili didn't have any beans, but it had a sweet taste sensation to complement the spiciness, so despite the fact it was bean-less, I was impressed. I already know what I'm going to order next time I visit. \n\nI automatically knew I was getting my money's worth when I saw just how big the meal was. Looking at the hot dog by itself, it's already officially the fourth best hot dog I have ever had (authentic Chicago-style, authentic NYC style and the hot dogs I used to get at the Gold Coast bowling alley all the time as a young'n are the only ones which were better). That hot dog with the toppings gave my taste buds an explosion of unique flavors I was not at all used to on the token \"mystery meat\" (which in the case of this restaurant is 100% beef, so what's in the hot dog isn't a mystery here). The mustard was a little bit too much, which is my fault as I was hesitant about adding that in the first place, not at all theirs. Otherwise, I was quite impressed. The fries were divine, with parmesan cheese, garlic and seasoning salt.\n\nThe ambiance of the place does not match the \"gourmet\" in it's title at all, which, again, in my humble out of the ordinary opinion is a good thing. It's a very home-y place, it already looks and feels like it's been a local staple for years and the staff is very down to Earth, helpful and friendly. It's location is unfortunate though, not only is Village Square basically dying but it's in that corner building next to Chicago Brewery which faces away from the street, a building which doesn't have a good track record with businesses at all. That said, all of the rave reviews it has been getting here on Yelp and in various local periodicals make me optimistic for this place. \n\nThe Final Verdict (something new I'm trying out for my reviews):\n\nPros:\nCheap considering what you get.\nCreative and experimental.\nPretty damn good hot dogs.\nOne hot dog can fill you up pretty well.\nDown to Earth ambiance.\n\nCons:\nThe dying shopping center it's located in. \nIt seems like they use mayo all over the place. Yuck. \n\nSuggestions: Using the term \"gourmet\" in the name of the place is rather off-putting. It's not expensive, and it's far from pretentious.

I found the hot dogs to be very flavorful, but borderline salty. The Banh Mi Dog was great in concept, but ended up not being my standout favorite. The pickled veggies did not have the sweet and tart bite that I love in a Vietnamese sandwich. The regular bun also detracts because an expected crunch is the best part about a Viet sub. The pickle juice also made the bun go soggy. It was a brilliant idea to reconstruct that texture with the crispy bacon, but then both meats just overpower the rest of the ingredients. I also wished that they used fresh cilantro instead of the dried stuff. Maybe this is why my friends don't go with me to Vietnamese places... Now on to why I give Buldogi 4 stars. The Angry Dog was everything I was hoping for. As the one I first ate, I hit my zenith early. The Asian slaw had a light sesame taste without over killing the harmony. The jalapenos and spicy mayo added the perfect amount of heat. The spicy pork on top was tender and plentiful.

What I love most about Buldogi's is that they have these awesome, uniquely inspired toppings on a quality hot dog and they don't skimp on those toppings. Kimchi? Check. Sriracha mayo. Check. Roasted garlic mustard. Check, check. Banh mi slaw? I DIE.

My favorite is the classic chili dog-yes, chili is full of meat, but there's something less daunting about it than strips of straight up beef or pork belly. The chili here is probably better than most chilis you've ever had-and to think they make it just to top hot dogs and french fries with-that's some dedication right there. \n\nWhat I am a fan of is the plain old dog.

On this particular day my 3 year old was a little grumpy.  We made it to the restaurant and ordered a couple hot dogs, kimchi fries, a mini hot dog, and a corn dog.  Right after we ordered, my 3 year old just loses it.  I think she got mad because her sister stole something she was holding.  My wife takes her to the car because she is a mess.  (if you have small children you know what I am talking about.)  I am sitting there with my 1 year old and all the food comes.  It looks delicious.  After a little while I start to eat and then text my wife to come inside and I will try to calm down my 3 year old.  She agrees and comes to enjoy her hot dog.  I get to the car and my 3 year old finally calms down.  As we are walking toward the restaurant my wife comes out upset and tells me to get the baby.  As I go into the restaurant my wife was getting a drink refill and our 1 year old throws my wife's uneaten hot dog to the floor.  So my wife lost it and was upset.  (like I said if you have small children you know the setting.) \n\nThis brings me to why I gave them 5 stars.  The food was awesome and different.  The girl at the counter was super nice.  She cleaned up the food on the floor right away and and they started making my wife a new hot dog.  At this point I am really embarrassed.  They were awesome, I apologized and said not to worry.

They had an NBA game on so I was happy.\n\nBeef Bulgogi Dog:\nYou get pieces of bulgogi on top of a hotdog with some green onions, bulgogi mayo and sesame seeds.  The bulgogi flavor balances the saltiness of the hotdog. I'd give it a 4/5\n\nBanh Mi Dog:\nYou had me at PORK BELLY!  It also has shredded carrots, cucumber and sriracha mayo.  4/5\n\nBuckeye Dog:\nI saved the best for last.  I thought the banh mi dog was delish then I had a buckeye dog with PORK BELLY BACON, garlic mayo, corn and cheese.  It was like neon lights and fireworks in my mouth! Definitely 5/5!\n\nEuro Special Fries:\nCrispy potatoes with cheddar cheese, pork belly bacon, herbs and garlic mayo. You have to eat 'em with a fork. After eating 2 hotdogs, trying to finish a basket of fries seemed almost impossible but they're sooo good I had to finish my fries. 4.5/5\n\nI must say though, the garlic mayo has a pretty intense garlic flavor (YUUUUUMMMM!!!) - you can tell they use real garlic and not just garlic powder.

Sadly I have not and this is where the sarcasm ends. However, for every review that I do put on yelp I stand by it completely, if only because I (like many of y'all) am a big foodie at heart (a certain somebody that overdoes it on yelp would disagree with me though)...\n\n... but all this brings me to my current review. I was brought over to this place from the multitude of repeated check-ins of a good buddy of mine. When he first described this place to me, I stupidly responded, \"What, you mean the place that used to be a Quiznos?\" ... after a short argument about the validity of life, we were here! They still had the Quizno's \"OPEN\" sign at the time too, which was great.\n\nThe atmosphere inside this place feels more like a quick lunch hotspot more than anything else, which is both very quaint and very relaxing. The service inside is nice, friendly, and very homely. Most importantly, the bathroom is very clean. Judge me how you will, but a messy bathroom is not a good place to be.\n\nAfter deciding on what to order (I got two specialized dogs while my buddy got the \"Angry Kimchi Fries\") and it arrived at the table, honestly I was surprised. The hotdog bun is normal, something you can probably get at a supermarket, but that's about as far as \"normal\" goes. These things were HUGE; if I had to imagine it way bigger than my stomach was supposed to probably handle on a normal lunch.\n\nThe feeling you get when you bite into something that's delicious is indescribable (picture Ratatouille description of 'flavors' and you'll get the general idea of it), but their Bulgogi Dog was amazing. The mix of flavors from the hotdog to the beef on top created a nice mixture of tang and salt that makes you crave for more, where the Hawaiian Dog infuses enough sweetness to say \"Mmmm...\" This place is one of the few times that describing flavors would fail me, as there's just enough on the menu for everybody. And those Angry Kimchi Fries? In a nutshell, it's sweet potatoes + kimchi + bulgogi + spiciness pretty much all blended together into an amazing complement.\n\nTo anybody in the area?

If they'd had better/faster service, this place would be a 5-star slam dunk.\n\nCame here for lunch with 4 other people from work, and we weren't in a hurry but we weren't out to spend 3 hours eating lunch. The place wasn't very busy, another party of 6 was there and some were already eating, and a party of 3 that was getting an order for takeout had just ordered and left to return later. We were the only people that needed helping, but unfortunately it took us 5 minutes of standing at the counter to get waited on, and ordering was a slight hassle since the guy at the register was a cook, and trying to make food while running the counter and answering the phone.\n\nThere were two guys working, and it seemed like they cooked exactly one thing at a time instead of many things at a time. When our food came to the table they came out of order from how we'd been in line and ordered them, and they came out one at a time. It was about 20 minutes from the first dish coming out (my fries, which I ordered second) to the last dish coming out (my buddy's hot dog, which he'd ordered last). The guy who ordered first got his food second-to-last. It doesn't make any sense...\n\nI got the Eurofries and an Angry Dog. The Angry Dog was supposed to be spicy, but it wasn't even close. Do not fear the Angry Dog. That said, it was really really good. The Eurofries were also really good.

I've had some jalape\u00f1os that really punch me in the face, but these had absolutely no flavor or heat at all. \n\nDon't take that to mean the Angry Dog wasn't good. I just skipped the jalape\u00f1os and everything else it came with was great. I have not a single thing bad to say about the Eurofries. \n\nFrom a healthiness standpoint, this place isn't going to win any awards. I mean, it's a fried hot dog and fries covered in sauces.

Remember to check in on Yelp for a 10% off offer (as of the date of this review!). \n\nFirst thing we noticed was the fact that they totally stole the Quizno's \"open\" sign! Haha.

My boyfriend and I decided to cut eat one down the middle and sample all three! Lovely idea. Really, it was just an excuse because we couldn't settle on just one.\n\nThe guy behind the counter didn't just call our names to pick up the dogs, but he actually went up to our table and laid it down. Wasn't expecting that gesture for a hotdog fast food place! Awww it's the little things that get me. Nice service here! I asked a few questions about the sauces, and the guy offered us to sample their mayos. Pretty helpful.\n\nEach dog was LOADED with the toppings. East Coast dog was savory, heavy, and sinfully lip-smacking good. Beef Bulgogi Dog was perfectly drenched in marinated bulgogi-goodness. Flavors worked well with the other toppings. To finish off, Angry Dog was just the right amount of spicy for me. This dog had extra-chewy bulgogi (mmm pork)! Pretty spicy but not overwhelming. Each one lived up to one another. My boyfriend was expecting a let-down or a dog that wouldn't taste as good as the previous, but no matter which dog you get, it holds its own! No disappointment whatsoever. In case you're wondering the difference between the BulGogi mayo and the BulDogi mayo: Bulgogi mayo has some sesame oil in it to specifically go with the asian fusion dogs. Buldogi mayo goes well with the pastrami. This attention to detail and taste is what makes this place awesome. Each one was a symphony of flavor.\n\nWould definitely come here again.

Guess customer service isn't quite the strong suit here.\n\nIn their defense, even for a late lunch, the crowd was steady- we ordered the bulgogi beef and the bahn mi dogs, plus an order of the chili cheese fries. I loved the bulgogi dog- piled high with beef and green onions, it was tasty without being overwhelming. BF preferred the bahn mi, which had a good assortment of crunchy veggies and pork belly, with srircha mayo that had a good kick to it. We really could have done without the chili cheese fries, and they were underwhelming- the fries were unsalted and the chili was very basic, we should have stopped at the dogs or tried the Euro Special instead.\n\nWas impressed enough with the dogs we had to come back- BF is already making a list of what he wants to try on his next visit. But we're more likely to split 3 dogs than do 2 plus a side of fries next time. One dog is easily a meal for a girl or guys who don't have huge appetites, so don't go overboard ordering.

One of the things that really bothered me was the excessive use of demanding signage everywhere within the restaurant.

I think that their execution could be done with more finesse and it looked as though everything was just thrown on.\n\nI also had the \"Carne Asada\" fries which were pretty average as well.

That may have been my first impression upon glancing at the menu, but after finishing my first meal here I am convinced this is the work of some evil mad culinary genius.       \n\nWent and checked out this place over lunch with a friend and decided to sample their two most popular items: the #1 (Beef Buldogi hotdog)  and the Angry Kimchi Fries\n\nThe beef bulgogi dog is a 100% premium beef dog covered with an avalanche of Asian cole slaw, grilled onions, generous strips of beef bulgogi (marinated beef with Korean seasonings, finished off with a dusting of sesame seeds and a light drizzle of house mayo.   The first bite of any hot dog usually begins with a naked end devoid of bread or toppings, and one can tell that the Buldogi dog has been grilled to that perfect smokey char with a nice firm \"snap\" of the casing that explodes with mouthwatering flavor.  The contrast in textures and flavors from the tender bulgogi, crispy slaw, smokey onions, creamy mayo, and toasted sesame seeds surprisingly round out one another in harmonious balance.\n\nThe angry kimchi fries was a whole other beast.  Wheras the oxtail chili cheese fries at Bachi Burger look better than they taste, the Angry fries here taste better than they look.  Start with a bed of sweet potato fries, add a layer of pork bulgogi, throw in some cooked kimchi and melted cheese with diced green onion and jalapeno, and then finishing the whole concoction with a sunny side egg, I found myself unable to stop with each progressive bite since something so wrong apparently seemed so right!  There's a stroke of brilliance with the choice of sweet potato for the starch since the natural sugar cuts through all the spicy and savory components and the richness from the cheese and runny egg yolk cleverly binds all the distinct bold flavors together  (pro-tip: break the yolk immediately upon being served otherwise the heat from the other ingredients will continue to cook the egg)\n\nIf I had one minor critique, it would be the lack of beer and the ambience inside is a bit drab since I think the food has heavy flavors that go well with beer in the company of friends with a sporting event in the background since I would totally attend any stadium or ballpark which served these items.

Since it has changed to Meat, Chix and Weiners, we have dined here 3 times. The awesome girl at the counter who has always helped me said everything will stay the same and the owner just didn't want to pay the franchising fee anymore. That would be false. Everything has changed. \n\nFirst off, the prices have increased. The price for what used to be a 10 piece is now an 8 piece. The quality of the chicken has also changed. You know how when you buy frozen chicken tenders at the grocery store, they're all identical in shape and size? Oddly enough, so are the fingers served at MCW. They didn't used to be clones of one another, so strike one.\n\nSecondly, the name is just disgusting. I had to tell my children that they're not allowed to say the name of this establishment anymore & just call it chicken bonz. It's funny to the middle school crowd, I suppose, but not appropriate for people with small children or those that respect themselves enough to not eat a place with such a dumb name.\n\nThird, they took away all the perks that made this place worth coming to. Kids eating free with purchase & AYCE wings every day have now changed to kids don't eat free, infact, they're watching Family Guy (which I wouldn't ever let my children even listen to) in the store, and there's only AYCE wings for an extra dollar than before on Tuesday only. When I was there once, two guys walked out after reading they don't have AYCE anymore and that it would be too pricey.\n\nLastly, the salad bar is disgusting. You can get AYCE salad for a cheap price, but it's gross. The lettuce is old and limp when I went at 2PM, they're too cheap to buy cherry tomatoes & instead just cut up a Roma, they have dry dry dried out baby carrots, and canned sliced black olives. It is a weird canvas to make a salad out of. Do NOT expect sweet tomato variety here. It's not even close. Just imagine someone strolling through the canned food aisle, grabbing random crap, and throwing it right onto your plate!\n\nThe owner was sick of paying the franchising fee but every time I have gone back since they've changed, it has been completely DEAD. So unfortunately, since he was too cheap to pay the franchising fee, he now has no business at all. What's worse?

Not a whole lot really stands this place out from the rest when you look at the basic facts, but one thing will bring me back in the future: their service. \n\nI purchased a Groupon-Now deal on my smart phone and drove to the location specified. I nearly passed it because it's tucked away behind a gas station. I walked in and was instantly greeted. I like that, by the way. There was a young gentleman and an older one behind the counter and both were extremely polite. I settled on a gyro and a vegetarian pizza. Prices were really reasonable, I'd be back for daily specials etc. in the future. \n\nAfter ordering I was asked if I wanted the gyro to come out at the same time as the pizza, or if I wanted to eat while the pizza was being cooked (they knew the pizza was mainly for my coworkers and the gyro was for me). How curteous! I agreed on eating the gyro while waiting for the pizza. It was brought out to me in a basket, a filling portion with yummy seasoned fries. The dressing for the gyro came on the side, which I thought was nice, and it was one of the better gyros I've had. He cautioned that everything was hot and asked if he could get me a water to go with my meal (I didn't order a drink). Again, how nice!\n\nIt was a quiet atmosphere when I was eating - they were slow for a Sunday night so I didn't get to see them interact with anyone else. I watched TV and just as soon as I was finished I saw the younger gentleman box up my pizza. He was going to bring this out to me too, but I beat him too the punch. He smiled warmly and thanked me again for my business. You could really sense their eagerness to do anything to make me happy. How refreshing.\n\nI had such a pleasant dinner here between working, it made the rest of my night go smoother. The gyro was really good, and my coworkers all were enthusiastic about the taste of the pizza (I tried it later - after it'd cooled and it still had good flavor - much better crust than I'd thought possible!).

Portillo's has a standard walk up counter for ordering, but today we were greeted by order takers who would then hand back our written orders to give to the people behind the counter. After paying, you are given a number and guided to the other end of the restaurant to wait at an \"order up\" counter. BTW, the lady working the mike and calling order numbers was extremely irritating, sounding like a carnival barker and, for some reason, feeling it was necessary to add a rhyming quip to every number called.\n\nI think this Portillo's was purposely over-staffed because it was grand-opening week, and they were still working out the kinks.\n\nONE KINK IN SERIOUS NEED OF A WORK OUT was delivery and presentation. we ordered 2 JUMBO CHILI DOGS, 1 LARGE CHEESE FRY AND A LARGE ROOT BEER. We waited 20 minutes and what we got was a soggy lukewarm mess. We were confused as to why were asked \"for here, or to go\" when we ordered, as, even though we clearly stated we were dining in, we were handed a paper sack of food and a drink TO GO.\n\nChili dogs don't wrap in paper very well. So what we unwrapped was a couple of smashed, room temperature messes with half the chili sticking to the paper wrapping. The dog was only ok, the chili generic, and they were a little too generous with the onions, but like I said before, \"HEY IT'S JUST A HOT DOG.\" In this instance, a hot dog with absolutely nothing special going on. \n\nThe cheese fries were hot and tasty with the cheese served on the side (again, in a to go cup). Not nearly enough cheese to satisfy the large order of spuds though, and I later noticed it was the same sized cup of cheese that came with the small order of fries too.\n\nI would discount this place as just another not worth it FRANCHISE OF THE \"BACK-HOMERS,\" and the parking situation really does need a fix. But just as we were finishing up, I spied a rather frail elderly lady hoisting a ITALIAN BEEF, and man, did she look happy. Happy enough, in fact, to make me want to go back to Portillo's and give it another shot, this time with the ITALIAN BEEF.\n\nHowever, if you're just looking for a hot dog to throw down for lunch, see the guy on the street corner and avoid the Portillo's hassle.\n\nAfter all, IT'S JUST A HOT DOG.\n\n***********************************************************************\nUPDATE ALERT!!!\n***********************************************************************\n\n9/21/13\n\nOk....went back and tried that Italian Beef I referred to earlier.

One way up in Scottsdale, and one down at the Tempe Marketplace - just opened!\n\nWell, her reasoning started, Tempe Marketplace has more stores around it, so let's go there!  Unable to deny that logic, we all piled into the wagon, hitched up the horses, and cracked the whip.

Well, it is, if you actually avail yourself of that technology.  Our approach?

Turning into the main entrance of the marketplace, all eyes were scanning everywhere.....\n\nOh!  there's a fish place!  ooooh, barbecue!  Care for a movie? We drive around the central clump of mall, watching the ballet of cars fighting for the best parking spots...no Portillo's.

We are leaving the Marketplace\"  \"Siri cannot be wrong, dad, the daughter says, keep driving mom.\"  \"Watch out!\" I shout as the pavement suddenly ends, turning into a deeply rutted dirt road.  Okay, really, forget Siri.  \"We're lost!\", the wife wails in frustration. \n\nI calmly take control.  \"Okay, let's get out of this sketchy neighborhood and back to the mall, it cannot be that hard to find a giant free-standing restaurant.\"  We drive east.  My daughter, still committed to Siri, says, \"turn in here!\"  \"Fine.\"  \"Turn in here.\"  Siri continues to guide us back to the mall, to places we've already been, finally announcing \"You have arrived!\"  We peer out over the empty dirt lot.  This cannot be Portillo's.  \"Wait, there's Security!\" the wife shouts.  \"Let's ask them!\"  \"Are you crazy?\"  I ask as I whip out my cell phone.  \"We are NOT asking Security where Portillo's is\", as the wife and daughter launch into a discussion about how men are afraid to ask directions.  \"Look\", I say, \"This says that the address is 65 S. McClintock.  Let's go back out to McClintock, and find 65 south.\"\n\nAfter 30 minutes of wandering aimlessly around the Marketplace, the technology of Yelp finally guides us to the location by providing the address.

Why not try it out since the other location is out of the way and FAR from me! I was soooo super excited I think I may have exceeded the speed limit to get there! LOL! The drive through was pretty thorough and awesome when I arrived. You had very nice (but crazy people, because they are standing outside all day in this heat) taking your order. I ordered my norm, chili cheese hot dog and chili chesses fries. My ordered was confirmed by at least 3 different people walking down the drive through taking orders and by the person who collects payment; they were all very nice and quick. I pulled up to the last person who brought me my order (even repeated my exact order back to me), super happy my order came out before the 2 cars ahead of me (how nice and fast) left the drive through and rushed to my friends to devour my delicious food. When I got home and opened up my bad of deliciousness I was completely disappointed!!! Immediate sad face! I received the wrong order! You know the feeling you get when your parents tell you you're going to Disneyland and they end up taking you to the doctor instead? It felt like that, the build up of awesomeness, then the tremendous sadness in the end! I was so sad and frustrated, for you are looking forward in enjoying a delicious meal and you receive an order you don't even want. I received a regular hot dog with mustard.... it would have been fine and I wouldn't be upset if I liked mustard, if I liked mustard a tiny bit, but I completely cant stand the taste of mustard, I hate it. I tried scraping the mustard off the hot dog and throwing the bun away, but it still had its mustard taste, so I tossed it! My chili cheese fries ended up being normal fries, so I ate those and pouted! I know things happen in the drive through ever now and then, it was just frustrating for my order was repeated to me so many times, there was no way I felt I even needed to check it before I left the drive through. Then getting all the way home to eat it and it not being the right order is just frustrating. It's a waste of money and then a waste of gas to drive back to get my correct order.

The Tempe store just opened a few weeks ago so my son and I decided to go. We should have gone to Smash burger around the corner. First, the place is on the NE corner of McClintock and Rio Salado. It is NOT really attached to Tempe Marketplace unless you park by the Imports store and walk through the breezeway to the restaurant. if you go, do this, because the parking lot is a total disaster. The lanes are too narrow for two cars to pass each other, so when (not if) somebody ignores the arrows and goes the wrong way, everything gridlocks. If you drive a pickup, don't park there, as it takes a 50 point turn to back out of the narrow spaces. After parking my truck in a spot more sized for for a smart, we walked all the way around the drive thru (which should have been on the other side of the store) and through the patio with too many tables to the line at the cash register. They have two lines, and a nice big easy to read menu on the wall. the problem is, there is a lady standing there that hands you a menu in size 4 font and expects you to figure out what you want before going to the register and while she is suggesting stuff to eat. I was told \" Please step aside while you make your selection, as the lines grow pretty fast. I don't want you to feel rushed.\" Really. At that point I felt rushed, told her so, and after looking behind me to see NOBODY in line but us, I walked up to the register, ordered something quickly without looking at the whole menu, and then stood in the throng of people at the pickup counter waiting for their numbers to be called, because you CAN NOT hear them in the dining room area. I guess they don't want you to get a table until your hands are full of trays of food. I can understand not taking a table while your family waits in line, but once you order, it's fair game.

I'll go back, but only for lunch, and not for a dog or a burger, Teds Hotdogs beats Portillos, and Smashburger and Burger Rehab are the only place to go for a burger in this town.

I figured by now the hour long lines will be long gone and everybody in Maricopa County had tried it at least once by now. So I get to the northeast corner of McClintock and E Rio Salado Parkway and enter a real clusterfork of a parking lot. Since the drive through lane is pretty big and surrounds Portillo's you have to park off to the east where there are signs telling you that you can only go in one direction. There is more parking beyond what you initially see when you first enter the area though. Pretty much all the parking right in front near the entrance are handicapped parking stalls. Fortunately, Portillo's was a late afterthought/addition to this mall so it has its own corner and is pretty much completely separate from the rest of the mall. An island of Chicago in a Tempe mall. If I remember correctly it's more or less the same corner that Nita's Hideaway used to be on many eons ago. So you come in and see multiple areas - one for phone order pickup, and all the way in back a place that you place your order. You then walk halfway across the restaurant after ordering and listen for your number. Everything comes in a thick brown plastic tray with four drink holders. So I ordered a standard fountain drink as well as a Maxwell Street Polish dog, a bowl of chili, and a tamale. Hadn't eaten all day more or less so I was hungry. Luckily it was not very crowded and I found some seating right away. I would hate to have to eat a hotdog in a hallway. So anyway, the hot dog was delicious - especially with the grilled onions sprinkled on top and with a bit of mustard as well. But no ketchup. Which is good because as Dirty Harry once said \"Nobody, I mean NOBODY puts ketchup on a hot dog!\" So that was the best part of the meal. Then I had the chili. Came with cheese and onions. It was alright. I like the chili at Lobby's better though. Truth. Finally - the tamale. It was wrapped in foil and then again in several layers of the kind of paper you wrap food to go in. It was one long greasy gut bomb. Pretty much plain masa and what tasted like the sauce in the chili inside it. Perhaps it's that toddling town's version of a tamale and if I was an ex-pat homesick for the Windy City I might have enjoyed it much more as the nostalgia kicked in. But since I'm NOT from Chitown and have only been once in my life for a couple of days when I was grade school age I was just curious as to what their tamales tasted like. Fortunately curiosity didn't kill the cat but instead gave him about 3 or 4 swift kicks to the stomach and a stern warning. NEVER EAT THOSE AGAIN. All night I felt my stomach churn and I'm sure the tamale was the the cause of it. If you ate 5 or 6 of those you'd be a walking tear gas/pepper spray cannister. So after I was more or less satisfied I walked back out into the night and noticed that the closest store in the rest of the mall to Portillo's just happens to be Lane Bryant.

The same quality ingredients are being used, but it seems like the training on how to properly assemble hot dogs, burgers, and everything else has suffered. Or management has simply stopped paying as vigorous attention to quality control. With a location over a thousand miles from Chicagoland I wondered if the menu would be different, if the way things were made would be different, and if being so far away the same degradation in food preparation that has infected the Chicagoland locations was present here.\n\nUpon walking in and looking around it sure looked and felt like a Portillo's. I didn't thoroughly inspect the menu as my order was taken while in line by a lady who wrote it down on the back of a bag, it appeared to be the same as the Chicago locations. I placed my order, and then got into the pick-up line to wait for my food. One trend I've noticed at the Chicago locations is repeated rhymes based on your order number. So they would call out things like \"Number two, your order is due\", \"Number three come see me\". I noticed with certain numbers they were doing the rhyming as well (this must be something they train on), but it wasn't the constant irritation of hearing it at the Chicagoland locatons to the point where you're trapped in a Dr. Seuss book.\n\nFinally my food was ready and I struggled to find an open seat without subjecting myself to eating outside where birds interrupting my meal was nearly a certainty. I finally sat down took my food out and snapped a picture. This was a regular Portillo's hot dog. The problem is we had the same inconsistent preparation we see at the Chicago area locations.\n\nFor any of those reading this review that are unfamiliar with what a Chicago style hot dog should be, I'll go over the basics. A Chicago style hot dog has a few different variations. The version served by Portillo's is the most traditional style which is an all-beef natural casing sausage. The natural casing is skin that when properly heated will give the frankfurter a nice bit of resistance and a snap when you bite into it. The classic Chicago style hot dog comes on a poppy seed bun which has been steamed to become soft and easy to bite into. It has a pickle spear or slice, tomato slice, sport peppers, bright green relish mustard, onion and celery salt on it. Ketchup is considered to be the worst possible addition to a Chicago-style hot dog as the sweetness overpowers the flavor of the other ingredients.\n\nSo how did the Portillo's of Tempe hot dog fare? The sausage itself was fine, but the relish application was a bit excessive. This added to the biggest problem,  the bun was steamed  too much along with being causing it to become a tad soggy. As a result the back half of the hot dog dissolved as I picked it up forcing me to struggle to finish the rest without getting my hands wet and sticky. The taste of the hot dog was roughly on par with other Portillo's, the big problem being a bit too thick of a pickle spear. \n\nI also got fries with cheese sauce. These fries were a litle over cooked, I'd say they were crispy but a few were so crisp there was no potato paste to be extracted from the inside. \n\nMy overall impression is that this isn't any worse than the Chicago area Portillo's on any given day. But Portillo's food quality isn't what it used to be either. I did notice quite a few people at this Portillo's with Chicago themed shirts, Bears and Bulls jerseys. While I'm sure Chicago transplants and visitors only make up a small fraction of their clientele, it struck me as interesting. This is especially true since there doesn't seem to be a lot of other Chicago themed eateries around the area. Overall, I'm going to give my Portillo's experience here two stars. But for the Phoenix area readers your mileage may vary as its unique to the area.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 10, "useful": 18, "cool": 16}}, {"text": "Havent had everything on their menu which is very extensive.

I figured Portillo's had to serve up a hot dog better than the one I had from a food truck in Phoenix. Honestly, the one I tried tonight from Portillo's was not any better. On a positive note, the Beef Hot Dog \"with everything\" ($2.65) had good flavor with all the fixings: mustard, relish, freshly chopped onions, sliced red tomatoes, kosher pickle spear, and sport peppers. My primary complaint was that the \"perfectly steamed\" poppy seed bun was pretty soggy from all the fixings by the time I got home. It seems that the hot dog might best be enjoyed in the restaurant as the bun doesn't stand up very well - or maybe they should serve the fixings on the side for customers taking the hot dog to-go. \n\nThe onion rings ($2.19) were pipping HOT and crispy, but lacked much in the way of flavor - definitely nothing noteworthy. \n\nThe customer service was excellent! The drive though service seemed like a souped-up version of the In & Out experience: a person takes your order outside (instead of an intercom at the menu), another person confirms your order and collects your payment (also outside by walking up to your vehicle), finally a third person grabbed my order from the window and brought it to my car. This doesn't seem like the most efficient system (and unlikely sustainable during the summer months) but it's a nice attempt to make the experience more welcoming and customer-focused. \n\nOverall: good, not great experience tonight. I will return to try other offerings and re-evaluate.

There are fans overhead and the area is covered by a ramada to add to ambiance of eating hot dogs and burgers in your patio (or your neighbors). Eating outside of Portillo's is really nice during our cool months though, it's very enjoyable!\n\nWhen you go to order your food, staff will be there to ask if you've eaten there before, if you haven't they'll explain the menu to you. When you order they write everything on paper bags - this way they know what you ordered and you won't get mixed up orders when you receive your food in the bags! You have to be attentive when they call your order out, they will not deliver your food to your table, so we usually wait around the window for our food or sit in the booth waiting for our number to be called. Numbers are not called in order, it's whenever the food gets out, so if you're one of those people who gets angry that number 85 got called before your 55, take a chill pill, because your food is coming out, just gotta have some patience!\n\nThe staff also makes up rhymes when your number is called, it's awesome! So far I usually order the polish hot dog with American cheese - but I can eat their crinkle cut fries and cheese sauce all.

We have been avoiding it because we dislike cash only establishments, unfortunately we can now avoid it because we don't much care for Ted's. \n\nI am from Upstate NY and I definately want to support bringing culturally pleasing (to me) food out to the desert. Knowing Ted's is from \"back home\" (since 1929), this encouraged me to break with our no cash only policy, besides I had to know if their hot dogs were better than the ones I import from Rochester to Arizona a few times a  year. It's expensive to bring Zweigles (since 1880) to Arizona and if there is a local replacement I was ready to find out.\n\nFirst the ordering of our food was confusing. The person on the grill heard the first two items and then started talking to others in line to take their orders and I wasn't done yet. It wasn't like I paused, it was like he just heard all he wanted from me and moved on. I had to interrupt the ordering going on after me and say, Hey! I'm not done yet. This annoyed him, obviously. But I couldn't believe it when I started to order the rest, It didn't seem like he was paying any attention becuase mid sentance he started talking cheese with the people in front of me!  Ahem... we need two white hots, two footlongs, two corn dogs, three medium logenberry's, a chocolate shake and an onion ring please...\n\nNext thing I know we are at the condiment section and the guy is putting stuff on my dogs I haven't even told him yet what I want on them!  Excuse me, I want to put Weber's mustard on that white hot. The grill guy yells over to me, \"We don't use Weber's, if you don't want yellow you can pump out the spicy mustard over by the straw station.\" \n\nThey don't use the mustard they are advertising in the window? They don't have the spicy mustard at their own condiment station? In the meantime the register girl has already totalled my order and my order hasn't even been made yet, so of course it's not correct. I said, it's not all here yet. This puzzled her. I said I am still waiitng for the corn dogs, the drinks , the onion rings and the chocolate shake. She started over and came up with a second total, also wrong. The shake came in a tiny size, they said they are one size only. Who knew.  The register girl screwed up the change as well. Good thing I didn't just swipe a card and get screwed not paying attention.\n\nWe got to the table determined to see if the food was worth the aggravation. Since the toppings were not done right and the onion rings were very undercooked and a gnarled mess I was really hoping the white hot dogs flavor would kick ass. This was my main reason for coming. It was a decent dog, but it was not better than the ones I have shipped in to my house.  Amazingly enough the best tasting of the dogs we bought were the corndogs! What a surprise. But not worth driving out to Ted's and having cash ready for them. As for the shake, it rivaled McDonalds to me and I'd be happier getting a mondo size Chocolate Peanut Butter delight from Lenny's.\n\nSo for atmosphere, service, food and cost it just doesn't rate more than the two stars I gave it.

You go to some other places in Phoenix and you're spending around 8 or 9 dollars for a hotdog, fries and coke.  Ted's is a few dollars less.\n\nIf there's any negative, the lines are frequently long.  I used to work around there and during the week at lunch time, I could see a line of probably 30 people.

All hot dogs and hamburgers are charcoal grilled, the sides are served in large portions, and they have many different toppings. \n\nNow there is another very similar charcoal grill restaurant in Tempe that offers hot dogs and hamburgers -ach*chuckbox*oo- but their fare is more hamburger friendly. Ted's offers regular, foot long, and all beef franks, as well as Italian, Polish, and White Hot Sausages.

Both the fries and onion rings are good, but I prefer the fries because of the batter on the rings.

Coming from Cincinnati, one of the most important preparations of a hot dog is the chili cheese coney. I went here tonight in search of a coney similar to that of Skyline in Cincinnati: a fried dog served on a steamed bun with bean-less, finely ground chili and heaps of shredded cheese. No charcoal grilled hot dog should be covered in chili, the chili itself is pretty thick, the cheese was nacho cheese, and the hot sauce was more like salsa.

Thus began a love affair that only grows stronger to this day.  Footlong Chili Dogs got me through a lot of hangovers and somewhere along the way college came and went, grunge came and went and my mullet came and went.  Then after college it was the All Beef Jumbo that got me through the trials and tribulations of being young, single, and semi-gainfully employed -- a few less hangovers, but still plenty of nitrates.  Then as a slightly older family man the White Hot has emerged as the sausage of choice for weekend trips with the Toddlers.  I even purchased my most recent residence perhaps partially because Spiro (the owner and son of \"The Ted\") lives across the street (ok - so maybe not the best approach to real estate decisions, but clealy Hot Dog obsessions can't be blamed for the entire real estate bubble).  This place is one of the last old school ASU spots and I pray that Spiro has a succession plan in place if he ever decides to retire.\n\nUpdate: It just occured to me that this posting could be a bit more \"review-ish\" and a bit less autobiographical, so here goes.  All the aftermentioned dogs are awesome.  The condiments are perfect...the mustard and \"hot sauce\" are proprietary and worth purchasing in jars to take home (the white hot with mustard, hot sauce, onions, and a pickel is as good as it gets).  The Chili is ideally matched with cheese and onions on the regular, footlong, and all beef jumbo.  The onion rings are the best in town.  The only complaint I have is the liquid cheese, but I've come to accept and even appreciate it a bit over the years.  The milkshakes are good, but a bit small for the price.

I always bookmark them because although I never know when I'll be in that part of the country, I do know those bookmarks will eventually become tourist destinations for me.  My yelp bud Tim S. knows his comfort foods.  When he raves about a pizza in New York, a cheesesteak in Philly, or a hot dog in Phoenix, I'm so there.  Wait a Hot Dog in Phoenix?  That can't be right.  This ain't Chicago or New York.  Or is it?  Ted's is a Buffalo, NY Hot Dog blooming right here in the middle of the desert, transplanted in 1983 from it's 1927 original wintery environment.  \n\nSometimes when you are a food tourist, it's ok to over order and try a few different things.  It's not ok for your waistline, but \"Hey you're on vacation!\"  At least that's what I tell myself.  And I got absolutely no judgement from Ted's when I ordered a Regular Hot Dog, a Jumbo All Beef dog, an Italian Sausage, and a Bratwurst.  Chased down with some Onion Rings and a Loganberry Milkshake.\n\nSo what makes Ted's so good, is the charcoal.  As I came in, they were adding a bunch of new charcoal to the grill.  It gives the dog a nice smokey flavor and a good snap.  Each of my 4 dogs/ sausages were excellent and it's tough to choose which one was best.  I actually think I preferred the basic hot dog, because of the soft grind of the wiener offset with the crunchy slightly charred casing.  It was texture heaven for sure, and I got this one dressed in classic Chicago style - chopped onions, relish, tomato, pickle, and yellow mustard.  I dressed the all beef with kraut and chopped onions - excellent dog although a little firmer in texture, as most beef dogs are.  \n\nThey have polish, bratwurst, italian, and a white hot under their sausage menu.  I read a couple of slightly negative reviews on the white hot, so while it sounded very interesting, I had no room to put one down on this visit.  Italian and Bratwurst it was for me and I got them dressed the same way with grilled onions and peppers.  I opted for the hot sauce on the side.  The hot sauce pairs perfectly with the Italian Sausage.  This is a nice and spicy Italian.  Adding the hot sauce seemed to just reinforce that same flavor, rather than cover it up.  Ted's has an interesting home made hot sauce.  If you made a salsa out of hot dog condiments, this is what you would get - relish, onions, in a ketchup vinegar base.  For the bratwurst I went straight up with some brown deli mustard.  Awesome!   Next visit, I'm trying a chili cheese dog for sure.\n\nThe onion rings taste like an onion loaf, but not super peppery.  They have a great batter here, but I like that you can still taste the onion and there isn't too much batter.  The Loganberry shake is a must order.  The perfect sweet creamy drink to offset the spicy Italian Sausage.  From what I understand loganberry is a Western NY flavor, because you don't see it around these here parts too much.  It's like a red blackberry.  I have no idea if it was loganberry flavored ice cream or vanilla ice cream with loganberry syrup.  Whatever it is, order it and you will be happy.  I can't wait until the next time I'm in Phoenix (or Buffalo) to get me a charcoal grilled dog at Ted's. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/teds-hot-dogs-tempe?select=HYh6Dv4htWxebTjRMwgh6g#OCLoB-p-pzUUNcCib8xK-Q", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 9, "useful": 11, "cool": 10}}, {"text": "Ted's Hot Dogs is one of those places that just emits an aura of times long gone. When walking into this establishment I immediately heard music from the 1950s and 60s. I could smell the meat cooking on the grill and I felt like I was in another world. I looked over Ted's menu and some of the signage and became aware that this place is tied to and related to a chain of \"Ted's Hot Dogs\" found in Buffalo New York. \n\nThe line was fairly considerable on my initial visit and after perusing the menu I settled on an all beef hot dog, onion rings and a soft drink. With the hot dog I decided to make it as close to a Chicago style hot dog as possible. So I asked for mustard, relish,, onions, tomato, and a pickle slice.  I took the dog to an open table and dug in. The taste of the sausage here is definitely different than the steamed Chicago style dogs I'm used to. One primary reason is that everything (well all the meats) at Ted's is char grilled. This gives a nice grilled flavor to it, the actual hot dog used had an unusual filler taste with a somewhat sweet flavor rather than spicy. All things considered it was a strange mix.\n\nThe onion rings weren't so great, these were very thin onion peels deep fried. While they were plentiful there was very little onion and just lots of batter. I'd say I was a bit disappointed with them.\n\nSince I've been in Arizona for quite a few days I did decide to return to Ted's and try things just a little differently. I went for a footlong dog which was only a little more expensive on my second visit. And rather than go for the toppings mentioned above I opted for Chili. The footlong dog was a great value and while the chilli was an extra 60 or so cents, I felt this was a much better dog than the one I ordered the first time and a lot of food for the money.\n\nI ALSO got a regular cheeseburger, this was fairly standard and tasted like most burgers that come off of a backyard grill. Not bad, but nothing worth writing home about.\n\nMy overall opinion of Ted's is that I love the ambiance and atmosphere, the food is pretty good and it's a good value if you go for the giant footlong hot dog.

I ordered the veggie dog, and my friend and I split some fries and some onion rings. I was in heaven. The hot dog was amazing, and they dressed it up exactly like I wanted it. The fries were thin (sort of like shoestring fries), which I actually like because they're great for dunking. The onion rings, however, on my first trip were awful. They were little more than greasy onions with little batter. On my next trip, I skipped the onion rings. I'm very glad that I decided to try again, though, because when I returned to Ted's yesterday, I ordered them and they were absolutely amazing. These rings were properly breaded and they tasted perfect. I believe they're made right in the store, as they're wrapped in wax paper.\n\nLong story short...the prices are amazing, the food is good, and this place is vegetarian-friendly.

DESPERATELY. I even feel a little bad about the review because the people were very nice, but when I review restaurants the FOOD comes first. The only time service overrides food in my ratings is when the service prevents me from getting any food. Anyways, continue for the actual review.\n\nWhen I heard about this kart, I was extremely excited. I mean, BACON-WRAPPED HOT DOGS. How could that possibly go wrong? Apparently, there are a lot of ways.\n\nI will start off with some of the things I liked about this place. First, the people working were very friendly, even if they had a hard time understanding what we were saying (didn't seem like their English was that great, i.e. when I asked where the tip jar was, they handed me a paper bag to put my soda in). They were generous enough to give us free drinks because we showed up right when they arrived and before they were set up, so we had to wait. Obviously, that was our fault and they didn't have to do that (this is why I went for the second star here) Second, the food is very low-priced. Third, they have Mexican Coke! You know, the good version of Coca-Cola? Unfortunately, none of these things were the reason that I wanted to eat here.\n\nNow, for the things that I didn't like so much. First off, when the hell are these people around!?!? It took my 5 tries before I actually managed to head over while they were there. As far as I can tell, they will be there around 7PM if they are coming at all and tend to come on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday Nights, if at all. As for the food, the hot dog was far from exceptional. Yes, the hot dog was bacon-wrapped. No, the bacon was not good. The bacon was the thinnest-cut, soggiest piece of bacon I have ever had. I was hoping for a thicker-cut, cooked to a little crisp or char, but that was not the case. Also, the bacon had very little flavor, probably due to how thin and soggy it was. On top of that, the hot dog was OBLITERATED with mayonnaise. I had to spend some time trying to scoop off the mayonnaise before I could eat it. Also, the hot dog seemed like your standard, store-bought hot dog without any of the really good hot dog flavor. I also tried the quesadilla, but it wasn't anything special.It was just a slightly greasy quesadilla with a mexican cheese inside, but that's about it. Food-wise, there just wasn't anything special about the food here. They didn't add their own little bit of magic, or whatever you wanna call it that makes it unique. And that little something special is absolutely necessary to make yourself stand out, especially with something as generic as a hot dog and a quesadilla.\n\nMaybe I just had my expectations set too high at the cue of Bacon-wrapped hot dogs, but i didn't find anything special here. I wish I could say otherwise about something as wondrous as a bacon-wrapped hot dog, but I can't. Anyways, if you want to try it, I won't stop you. But, don't be fooled by the appeal and the potential magic of the bacon-wrapped hot dog, because you will be disappointed.

This is PHOENIX. It's not Chicago. It's not New York. It's not St Paul, Minnesota (although for half the freakin' year it's hard to believe that last one). If you want authentic stuff from your home town then why the heck did you move here? I'm an Aussie and I never shoot places down simply because the hamburgers and fries don't taste like what I grew up with. If I don't like the food I say so. If I don't like the restaurant or service I say so, and vice versa. If only people could judge based on the individual pros or cons of restaurants and their ~local~ competition, and not some rose-coloured memory they have of sometime years ago or someplace three thousand miles away, things would be a lot fairer. Plus, this is a HOT DOG place, not some haute cuisine dining establishment! Exactly how different do Chicago buns or pickles taste?! If I maintained this same philosophy, every single Indian restaurant I've eaten at in Phoenix would get a single star rating. See how this works?\n\nRant over. Went here for dinner the other night, arrived at just after 6pm. A lady with iridescent blue eyes greeted us and was very friendly in discussing the different options. Truth to tell, there aren't many - Chicago Style, one or two other styles, and a kids menu with three or four combo options. The lady noticed our toddler and said that if he sat on the other side of the table she would turn cartoons on for him on one of the tellys. We ordered our stuff and out it came in a few minutes. First plus were the fries. If you've read my talk thread here (http://j.mp/ovV41z) you'll know how I feel about crispy fries. Props to this place for serving actually fresh fries (albeit with the skin on). Yes, they were a bit oily - you get that when fries are fried in oil. Yes, they were a bit soggy - you get that when fries aren't pre-processed by blanching. These fries are what you get when 1) you chop a potato and 2) fry it thereafter. Try it sometime. Go to In-N-Out, same thing. If you want crispy fries, go somewhere else. Me, I could have eaten them all. day. long.\n\nHotdogs were okay - it was my first go at Chicago style. I got two. Pickle, tomato was fine. The relish was sort of a bright fluorescent green - bizarre, but tasted ok. I didn't get the sport peppers as I had had jalapeno for lunch. One mistake was to forget to ask for no celery salt - I hate the taste of celery and the salt spoiled the dogs for me. I wiped off what I could. Still finished both. The wife enjoyed hers. She had a tray of chili fries - very good indeed. The kid wolfed down his dog and half his fries, as expected.\n\nAll in all, a great meal. I was checking in on Yelp when the wife told me that they had already closed. Sure as shinola it was after 7. I read on their facebook page that they're planning to stay open a little longer. 7pm shutdown is definitely way too early and puts this place dangerously close to White Eagle IMO in terms of stupid business hour planning. But, 6pm is fine for us for a family dinner and it's not like we got bounced out at closing time. Anyone looking to have dinner later, just stand in front of this place and then turn your heads left and right. Several options. You know, or else just move back to Chicago where everything is so much better.\n\nI would have given this place a solid 3 star average, but it nosed up to 4 due to the thoughtfulness of the counter gal and the quality of the fries. Screw authentic, the food was good. And now I've half a mind to go eat at Portillo's in Chicago and then slam it on Yelp because the hotdogs didn't taste like the dogs I ate back in Phoenix.
