Most people think catfish is easy to make but the truth is, most people don't know what the heck they are doing when it comes to frying up good catfish. It needs to be cleaned perfectly, seasoned to perfection and fried crisp; this is exactly what you get from Hush Puppy. Just thinking about the finger lickin' catfish makes me so happy.  Did I mention how amazing the Hush puppies are? And they give you a side of honey butter to dip them in.

So when I done found out that there was a place that locals thought was better'n Red Lobster, I just had to check it out.\n\nFor starters, we got what looked like mini-corn dogs without the stick. I was disappointed to find there was no finely ground meat-in-a-tube inside but just corn meal. That's when I realized that we never ordered mini-corn dogs but that these were the restaurant's namesake HUSH PUPPIES. Um, well, I suppose these are corn dogs, er, hush puppies because they are two-bite corn meal nuggets, but they sure don't seem like the hush puppies that I'm used to. Hell, Long John Silvers has traditional hush puppies that are more like the real deal. These look like a yellow robot rabbit vacated it's bowels into a red plastic, wax paper lined basket. But hell, I'll eat fried bull testicles (aka Rocky Mountain Oysters) so why not eat yellow robot rabbit turds? With the honey butter that they supply, they actually have a subtle pleasant taste to them, if you're looking for something sweet and fried that is.\n\nThe reason we went to the Hush Puppy is that it was billed as a Louisiana style restaurant. Visions of Cajun and Creole danced in our heads on our way over (which made driving quite a chore... no more White Widow Kush before operating light-heavy machinery). When we got there we were pleasantly surprised that it was Cajun without the Creole, or more like Creole without the Cajun. \n\nThe FRIED GREEN TOMATOES were actually quite good and were on special at $2.95. They are regularly $4.95 which would have been a rip off, but for $2.95 it was okay. And they do have GUMBO as an appetizer for $6.95. It comes in a bowl and you can add ALL YOU CAN EAT SALAD BAR for $2.95 which makes it a meal.\n\nWell, let's talk about the Salad Bar. It was sad. I would say that it was basic, but it didn't even have Broccoli or Cauliflower. In other Yelp reviews I read that people were happy that it was clean and there wasn't tomatoes in the dressing and such. Yeah, I'd be happy about that, too, but that doesn't UP the star rating, it just keeps it from going down. The selections on the Salad Bar were extremely limited. (There was an area that could have held 6 more pots of dressing or ingredients that was basically just ice covered by whole leaves of a leafy lettuce which was just a space filler. They have the room, they don't have the desire to put more out.) The one saving grace on the salad bar was the COLE SLAW. It's slightly more coarse than KFC cole slaw and a little less sweet, which makes it perfect in my book. Cole Slaw is one of those dishes that people regularly disagree on. It seems to depend on how you had it when you grew up, and the cole slaw here is just the way I like it. But the rest of the salad bar is sub-par.\n\nBut if this is a Louisiana or Cajun or Creole place, what was seriously LACKING was anything like JAMBALAYA or ETOUFFEE. Yes, they have ALLIGATOR TAIL and FROG LEGS, but where's the classic dishes? Why not offer them?\n\nMy girlfriend ordered the BLACKENED CATFISH with BAKED POTATO and CORN ON THE COB. The Blackened Catfish was actually very good. The blackening tasted very good (although I like extra blackening and can always use a little more.) A little sprinkle of salt really brought out the flavor and it is a dish that I would recommend. The baked potato was overdone, indicative of mass cooking them and keeping them in a warmer too long. The worst part of her meal was the ICE COLD CORN ON THE COB. Blech. One bite and it was \"NO THANKS!\" That's a serious lack of attention to detail on the kitchen staff. (I don't expect the waitress to notice the temperature of something like that.)\n\nIf you are looking for large quantities of FRIED SEAFOOD at a very reasonable price, there are a lot of options. ALL YOU CAN EAT FRIED CATFISH (Fillets or Fiddlers, which are small whole catfish) and ALL YOU CAN EAT SHRIMP, or a combination of two of the above for $12.50. Most people are done with AYCE Fried Food once they're out of high school (or maybe college for some), but if that's your thing, then it sounds like it's quite a deal here. They do have AYCE CRAB LEGS on Monday night (for something like $24) but my experience wasn't good enough to merit a return trip so I won't be finding out what a deal it is.\n\nI'm not saying that you shouldn't eat here and I understand how places like these can grab a loyal local patronage. For me, there are way too many much better places to eat that I can't imagine coming back on my own volition. By the way, pulling out of the parking lot we had already come to our verdict, but by the time we got home, my girlfriend had a very upset stomach that lasted through the night. I'm sure it was just luck of the draw but it ended up being the final straw.\n\nKitty Got Si", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Beyond sad edging into embarrassing. \n\nMight as well take your money dip it in lard and set it on fire. \n\nThe food is gross, no flavor, greasy without being good and the place is grimy.

We are both big crab and lobster buffs, and I wanted to find hot, fresh crab legs that hadn't been sitting in ice while lines of people annhilated them like they'd never seen food before. I came across reviews of this little \"hole in the wall\" establishment and wrote down the address. If you have a rental car, or are visiting someone with a car, it's perfect. However, a cab ride from a hotel on the strip will cost you 25 bucks to get there; a tad steep, but I think it was definitely worth every penny. \n\nWe came there for one reason and one reason only: all you can eat crab legs. I can't say anything about their catfish or the salad bar, but after looking over the menu for the heck of it, they do have a large selection of seemingly authentic southern dishes; gator bites, fried oysters, etc. Also, the service is extremely friendly and very efficient; our waitress wouldnt let our crab plate get empty or the bucket for the shells too full, but she would always ask if were ready for another plate full so they wouldn't get cold. Even with tables everywhere, she never seemed flustered and made small talk with every table. \n\nThe crab legs themselves were delicious; really large legs and claws and none of them short of meat. We also tried the Rio seafood buffet and the crab legs at the Hush Puppy were 10x better. A buffet is too scrambled with people fighting over crab legs, so to get them served to you whenever you want and as much as you want while theyre piping hot is a wonderful treat. The only downside, like previously mentioned, is how far it is from the strip.

I REALLY did.  My husband is from Arkansas and I lived in the south much of my life.... so finding out there was a Southern restaurant in Vegas made us very excited.  I also love crab legs so I was doubly excited to try the AYCE on Monday night.\n\nI have to say that the crab legs were probably some of the absolute best crab legs I've ever had.  They were very meaty.... no flimsy ones in the bunch (and believe me, we ate a BUNCH!).  Our waitress was also very nice.\n\nThat's where the good part stopped, though.  The restaurant itself is in dire need of a good cleaning.  It feels dingy and dirty.  We were seated right by a \"waterfall,\" which was a joke.... just embarrassing, really.  PVC pipes barely pushing out a trickle of water into a cement tub of chipped paint.  I think they would be better to just board up the windows so no one could see that thing.\n\nThe salad bar is pretty much a joke too.  As others have mentioned, it doesn't have a whole lot of items on it, and those that are, are questionable.  Not exactly fresh looking.\n\nAnd with a name like the \"Hush Puppy,\" I would expect some REALLY GOOD hush puppies, but no... they were just pretty \"meh.\"\n\nMaybe if I were in the mood for crab legs, I'd go back... but really there are enough places in town that serve pretty good crab legs and also have a nice ambiance...

My expectation go way down where AYCE is involved so if it is even decent I'm usually blown away. This place is definitely a pleasant surprise for the price. The service was friendly, and more than adequate for this style of dining.\n\nWe went on a Wednesday and had the AYCE ribs, which also includes AYCE catfish, shirmp, a side, hush puppies, and small salad bar, all for only $14.95! \nThe hush puppies were decent because they are served with honey butter, but don't have anything on the inside like corn, onion or cracklin which are always included in a proper hush puppy, and I expected better when considering it is the establishment's namesake.\nThe star of the salad bar is the cole slaw. For those of you who love good slaw with something fried or grilled, this is the best i've had anywhere in Vegas.\nWe all disagreed as to who has the best ribs in town, but we all agreed that these were the best (& only) AYCE ribs ever, and well beyond what you expect out of a seafood restaurant. They are small, smokey and sweet, not overcooked, but not the mush you get on most buffets.\nThe catfish was good but somewhat inconsistent. I am a fan of small whole fish(\"fiddler's\" as they are called, which they have, but not as part of the daily special), but these are filets. The first batch we had was just OK, but when we got the second round they were greasier, oilier, and had a great salty taste that went great with the sweet slaw, tartar, and an ice cold Abita. \nThe shrimp were just fried shrimp, but surprisingly plump. \nFor a side you can get fries or greens. If you are a fan of collards, you HAVE to go here. These are the only greens I've ever had in a restaurant that rival those made by my family in GA. Al dente without being crunchy or mushy, with tons of pork in the mix. \nRather than put everything out Buffet style the serve each order family style, so it's fresh when you get it.\nIn addition to the all you can eat we wanted to sample some of the more unique southern fare, that you often can't find in Vegas without paying an arm and a leg.\nFrog legs. Great taste, with light breading, and not overcooked like they usually are. $6.95\nFried green tomatoes, nice small thinly sliced, and properly breaded, but they just didn't have the right taste. They were perfectly executed with remoulade but the batter just needs more spices to it. $4.95\nAlso...Cheapest oysters in Vegas: $9.95 for a dozen. They aren't the best i've had in Vegas, but for the price they get the job done.\nFried alligator, which was served in nugget form. Here again the execution was great, and the gator meat tasted great but the breading just doesn't have the right spices to stand up to the dark oily meat so it seems flat tasting. $6.95\nSo, the 3 of us shared 4 appetizers, had 3 all you can eat meals, and 2 beers a piece and the bill was exactly $100.\nI haven't been on a Monday yet for the AYCE crab legs, but i'm sure I will be back several times to try each of the daily specials so I'll update as I try more.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 3, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "To be quite honest, my experience was slightly disappointing.

However, some menu items are better than others, in my opinion.\n\nSo you're probably wondering about the catfish. I love it. I love it to the point that my (seafood fanatic) husband couldn't touch another piece of fried fish for six months after I made him eat catfish for dinner daily for two weeks. Luckily he's over his aversion, as we went through the (highly convenient) drive-thru just the other day! I won't say this is the end-all, best catfish in the world, but it's in my top two or three.\n\nThe ribs are really good too. I'm usually cautious about ordering ribs because I am very picky about them. My usual fears are unfounded, as The Hush Puppy prepares them just the way I like them: crispy/charred on the outside, falling off the bone and not sauced to death. I take it a step further by ordering their (excellent, btw) barbeque sauce on the side rather than slathered on the ribs themselves. The Wednesday (and Saturday too, at the Nellis location) AYCE rib special comes with catfish, fried shrimp and probably some other stuff I cannot recall. I think one time I was able to eat judicially enough to be able to order a second plate of the ribs, but AYCE for me these days translates to \"damn, not nearly enough!\"...\n\nFor those of us not wanting to die of a heart attack on the way out of the restaurant, I can recommend a couple of \"lighter\" options. The crab legs platter is ridiculously cheap and B-I-G. There's also a combo plate featuring only grilled items: \"Cajun Fantasy\". It comes with a blackened catfish fillet, a skewer of grilled shrimp and stuffed oysters, if I'm remembering correctly. It's definitely not a heavy dinner and is the only thing I've ever ordered that I am able to finish. \n\nThe basket of bullet-shaped hush puppies brought to the table shortly after sitting down is always solid. I like them with or without the honey butter, but c'mon, what WOULDN'T be made better by honey butter? I've always been accustomed to more savory hush puppies, usually with onion inside. This is an interesting change.\n\nThere's a small salad and condiment bar offering up a good chow chow (which I will put in and on nearly everything on my plate), tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, some typical salad items/dressings, coleslaw, potato/macaroni salads and maybe one or two other things I am forgetting. I usually make myself a little salad, take a spoonful or two of the mayo-based stuff and get my condiments before dinner. I was initially taken aback by the fact that you get your own sauces, but I quickly realized that for a sauce-Nazi such as myself, it's a blessing. I've always found the salad bar area clean and with fresh items, personally.\n\nThe restaurant itself is rather oddly decorated and has many different rooms/corridors. Half the time I get lost on my way to and from the salad bar. That's okay though, and I think it would be a brillant place for a large group, since many of the \"rooms\" have just a couple of tables.

I was very mistaken. The hushpuppies were more like corn bread nuggets, nothing like the cornmeal fried delights that I'm used to.

I put salad bar in quotes because it offered only one choice of lettuce with few veggie toppings, but I will give them credit that they did have a large variety of dressings. \nAlligator tail: A good appetizer. The breaded deep fried nuggets of gator did not have any distinguishing flavors. I could have been eating fried chicken nuggets and I would not have known the difference. However, the breading did have good seasoning and the nuggets were crispy so that is a plus. \nThe freshwater catfish was thinner and milder in flavor whereas the farm-raised catfish was thicker with a stronger flavor. Both preparations were a big disappointment. The breading was completely bland and the fried fillets weren't crispy. So it was an overall soggy flavorless dish. The only thing that made it palatable was the cocktail sauce that I dipped it in. If you ever had the opportunity to eat at Catfish Alley- this place pales in comparasion. \nThe fried shrimp was a little better, but I could have gotten better fried shrimp from the Red Lobster. \nPlus side: the catfish/shrimp dishes are AYCE so if you have a large appetite you can eat your weight in fried seafood, but for me and my husband, we left full... but not satisfied.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "My wife and I have been fans of The Hush Puppy since we discovered them nearly a decade ago.  Sadly, due to issues with my health and other factors we haven't been out to eat very much at all this past few years, but that is changing, so we were really stoked to make The Hush Puppy the place for our 10th anniversary dinner.\n\nThey still have the same great specials which drew us to them to begin with; namely, the all-you-can-eat shrimp and catfish, with oysters and clam strips added for only a couple dollars more on Thursdays.  Sadly, I think the quality of the seafood has declined in the last few years, but everything was certainly still palatable and the oysters are still my favorite.  My personal theory is that the destruction of the Gulf of Mexico due to the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster may have a lot to do with this.  Since their prices haven't increased much at all, they may be sourcing their product from China or elsewhere now out of sheer necessity.  They also no longer offer frozen margaritas or mudslides like they used to.  The alcoholic beverages are now only beer and wines and I'm not really partial to either, so we stuck with Diet Coke and tea.\n\nThe salad bar is also very limited now, and one thing which I found REALLY weird was that the only option for onions was whole entire scallions.  Not chopped up into little bits, but the whole 7-inch stalk from green end to white.  The pecan pie we had was good, but to be honest it was a bit overbaked.\n\nOur server was a real sweetheart, and I had no problem tipping 25% rather than the normal 15.  I didn't get her name, but she was very attentive and friendly and earned every penny despite some shortcomings with the food.\n\nI give this establishment a 4-star review in spite of everything because I think that The Hush Puppy is still doing their best to deliver good food at a reasonable price in spite of likely problems with sourcing product and the fact that the Las Vegas economy is in generally horrible shape.

Or shall I say honey butter with hush puppies.  It's as though these two need to coexist in flavor.  I tried the hush puppy alone and you just can't indulge without the butter.  Now, if you're expecting a Long John Silver kind of hush puppy, this is not it.  It's more like a yummy corn meal concoction shaped like a cocktail sausage.

You get one trip to the salad bar and that was fine.   The plates are nicely chilled and there are a few mayonnaise based salads like Mac salad, potato salad, some kind of kraut (?) salad and of course, green salad fixins'.  It was all delicious. \nI ordered the award winning gumbo made with turkey.  I didn't see okra in this soup but it had the right amount of flavor and saltiness that I would recommend it.  Different and unique for sure.  Now comes the actual entr\u00e9e.  We decided to be adventurous and order the platter which included alligator meat, farm raised catfish, fried oysters.    Like the old adage, \"It tastes like chicken\" is true about the 'gator meat.  Yes, even my son will have bragging rights that he ate alligator and actually liked it.  It looked like a chicken nugget.  He also ordered a grilled cheese and really enjoyed it.  \nI'm not a fan of any farm raised fish, however, the entree came with it.  The catfish was crispy coated in a cornmeal crust and fried just right with no greasy residue, perfect accompanied with tartar sauce.\nNote: tartar sauce does not arrive with your meal.  You need to pick that up at the salad bar.  \nSo if you have a hankering for fried Bayou type of food, check this place out.  It's not Cajun spicy at all though.  Next time, I will def order the snow crab legs which I heard are flown in from Canada.  This restaurant has some uniquely prepared signature dishes like their hush puppies, alligator meat, catfish and gumbo that would bring me back.

I've been suspicious of the Hush Puppy for several reasons, shady area, \"southern food\" in Nevada, and most telling a never quite full parking lot when I go by. Still I gave it a shot because there are plausible reasons why a good or even great restaurant my experience any one if not all of these things. Unfortunately that wasn't the case as I saw it last night. \n\nThe restaurant it's self has been at this location for many years and it's age is showing; faded paint, outdated fixtures and furniture, it almost had a depressing feel to be honest. \n\nWe waited a few minutes at the register as there was no hostess or sign inviting us to seat ourselves. Not a big deal but as the place wasn't that busy I questioned why we had to wait at all. We placed a drink order straight away and were told to help ourselves to the salad bar and hush puppies at the table. The salad bar was marginal at best, few topping options and the cherry tomato's were a bit old but not too bad. I did like the coleslaw. The hush puppies at the table were not at all what I had expected, about the size of a my little finger and oval in shape they had no flavor and I quickly put them to the side; I've had some delightful hush puppies in the past with chopped onions and seasoning. \n\nFortunately we didn't have to wait too long for our meal to arrive, the all you can eat seafood included fried butterfly shrimp, cocktail shrimp, clam strips, deep fried oysters, and fried catfish (really seafood?) with a side of french fries I nibbled but left to the side as to focus on the seafood. With the exception of the clam strips which I found tough and gamy I liked everything on the plate. While surprised having catfish in a seafood special it was good, I liked the butterfly shrimp the best. The food as definitely the best part of my experience which is why I gave it two stars. \n\nI was very disappointed at the service, there were maybe four tables in our section, not an overwhelming prospect for a waitress I would think yet ours spent more time in the kitchen. My water was empty shortly after our plates arrived and I didn't get a refill for nearly 10 minutes, unacceptable. \n\nIf you must have \"southern cooking\" in Las Vegas and have nowhere else to go I suppose you could give them a try as other guests have given favorable reviews but I wouldn't recommend it.

We were charged $2 for the side of green beans when the kids menu clearly stated \"served with a side.\" My husband brought this to the server's attention and explained how this can be misleading that we were charged for a side that says it comes with the kids' entree. She understood and took it off the bill without any problem.\n\nNeedless to say, it just made me ill to pay $60 of our money and time when there are so many other better places in Town Square. Pretty disappointing. I thought that it's predecessor, Cadillac Ranch, was decent and had a great menu selection and was hoping that  it's replacement would be at the very least equal or better.

I had read about the change from Cadillac Ranch and thought it was worth a shot. I felt pretty meh about Cadillac Ranch and I like to try new places. Another friend of mine referred to this place as \"the place where they stand outside and beg you to come in.\" There's a reason they have to beg people to come in we would soon find out. We did get the option of outside or inside seating; we chose inside, booth. \n\nIt was 10ish minutes before someone came to ask if we wanted drinks. She said they were switching sections so I gave her the benefit of the doubt, but seeing staff socializing and drinking while you wait, even if it's due to a section switch, just makes you more annoyed and frustrated. The server was actually quite friendly and attentive. She tried to tell us about happy hour, but she wasn't sure when it began or ended. The whole conversation gave me the impression there's a lack of continuity in training the staff. We needed a minute to decide, she brought our drinks in a reasonable time. I ordered the cucumber mojito which was delicious. That was pretty much the highlight of my meal though.\n\nOur food seemed to take a long time, although I'm not sure exactly what the time frame was. It could have been that I was frustrated with the experience already at this point. When it finally arrived it was meh. My boyfriend ordered the firecracker coleslaw which at first he thought had Rice Krispies in it on account of the crackling sound. He soon deduced it was actually pop rocks. There was no description of the coleslaw so he assumed \"firecracker\" referred to a spicy flavor rather that the sound it makes. While I get what they're trying to do, it really seemed like a crappy dish made from ingredients on the Food Network show Chopped. He said his burger tasted like a Burger King burger with Ranch House's crappy chili on it. I had the sliders with roasted jalepe\u00f1os and \"garlic salsa.\" By garlic salsa they mean marinara sauce. I had green beans with mine which tasted like they were waived over hot water. They were crunchier than they should have been, practically raw. Our friend's meal was meh. Underwhelming to say the least. In an attempt to redeem the meal, I wanted to order the sweet potato melt only to be informed they were out of sweet potatoes. At that point I threw my hands up and decided it was a place I'd rather not return to. I suspect it won't be around long.\n\nI thought that was the end of it, until I woke up sick this morning. I didn't have anything else after that meal and I'll be spending my day nursing my digestive system. I would advise against this place whole-heartedly which is unusual for me.

I had never eaten here before, and I did indeed check the reviews before entering this place, but I threw caution to the wind because they had less of a wait time than Yard House. Oh boy, that's where I went wrong.\n\nThe hostesses were pleasant, and the wait really was not that bad. But then we were sat in this strange booth that was completely separate from the dining room and it was on the side of the bar, but not a part of the bar either because there was a railing between us and the bar. \n\nI'm not going to completely document our experience, but I am going to highlight a few of the more deplorable offenses. The waiter sniffed my drink to make sure it was Dr. Pepper. WTF moment number 1. We ordered pretty simple dishes because we were indeed going to see a movie. My niece ordered a BLT with the Doritos Mac & Cheese side dish. I ordered half a house salad and the Loaded Baked Potatoes with the Pulled Pork. We then proceeded to wait for 45 minutes before our waiter arrived at our table to tell us there was a big party taking up the kitchen and our meals would be out \"very soon\". So, we missed our movie. Luckily there was another showing an hour later.\n\nNext, we waited again for our food. During this time the manager came up to us and apologized, comped our meal, and gave us a free dessert.\n\nThe meal finally arrived. They brought the incorrect sandwich to my niece. She ordered a BLT and it was a turkey club. She had to wipe all the turkey off of it. The salad was a poor excuse for a salad with tiny witherlings of shaved carrots. The loaded baked potatoes were okay, but the drizzling sauces they put all over it were not my thing. The Doritos Mac & Cheese was seriously one of the worst things I've eaten in my entire life. My niece and I both agreed would wretch right there at the table if we had another bite.\n\nWe then awaited our cookie (minus the ice cream) so we could take it to go. We waited, and waited, and waited. Our server arrived to inform us it was still being cooked (we already about to be late to the SECOND MOVIE SHOWING). I decided to leave, so we walked out the door.

We had been at the Yardhouse for dinner, so we wanted to check out something different for post-movie drinks.  As we were walking up we were somewhat awkwardly greeted by a Ranch House hostess, about 10 feet outside of the restaurant.  She was VERY nice, but it was a weird spot to be greeted.\n\nGoing into the restaurant, it looked like a great place. HUGE (probably too big) but it looked like it should have been a place that was successful - clearly they had put a lot of money into it.  Sadly.... we were just about the only customers in the joint.  As we walked past the mechanical bull I was a bit surprised to see a girl of no more than 8 sitting on it.  It was strange to say the least.\n\nWe finally got to our table and we quickly noticed that the employees outnumbered the guests by at least 4:1.  Our first round of drinks came out pretty slowly, and my friend said the margarita was awful.

It was clear that the girl who had been there awhile was not very interested in us.  The girl who was training was much more attentive and spent some time talking to us at the table, which I suppose we expected from them since the place was basically empty.\n\nOverall it was sort of a strange experience.

For a bar-food restaurant it wasn't bad at all. In fact, I quite enjoyed it. Being located at Town Square I think some people might walk in with high expectations.\n\nWe chose to sit on the patio because there's four big screen TVs playing each of the college football games. I love it how there's misters everywhere, it never got too hot in the +100 degree weather that day. The overall decor is nice, themed like an average BBQ venue - sports memorabilia, wooden walls and furniture, and lots of TVs. The service is some of the friendliest I have had! It was pretty busy but the staff took care of our water and orders constantly. My order came in about 20 minutes, even though the place was pretty busy.\n\nWe ordered the chicken fingers, potato skins and taco pizza, which are all under the Happy Hour menu at 50% off. The potato skins are my favorite, served with melted cheese, chives, and a touch of sour cream. None of the dishes were THAT oily. Try having real bar food from a small local casino near Boulder Highway and you'll know what I mean. The food is nothing to rave about, but for what it was, I liked it. Chicken fingers were served hot and the taco pizza was pretty unique, although I'll probably have regular pepperoni next time.\n\nThe biggest takeaways for me was their lack of a standard nacho dish. They have a nacho dish but it only comes in BBQ flavor. Why? I personally don't like BBQ seasoning except when it's used for meat. Also, their pizza menu is pretty small. They don't have a supreme topping, something that has everything on it. They just have a few regular ones. In the end, we were happy replacing the two with the potato skins and the taco pizza, but I can understand how this can upset some eaters.\n\nSeeing that places like TGIF and Applebee's have four stars or close to it, I think Ranch House Kitchen deserves better.

Parrot Heads. They did a half-assed job and so did Chuy's. It lacks the charm I remember the old Metro Center location having.\n\nThe chips were stale, the salsa was lame, the tri-tip was dry. The service was ok but apparently Wednesday night is the night to visit your buddy who works at Chuy's and get your drink on..I dunno maybe it's just short of payday and you couldn't afford your meds so this seemed like a good idea at the time. \n\nPoint being I had to (got to?) listen to a loud conversation about a guy's terrible luck. He got pulled over speeding while hauling a trailer that he knew had no lights and got ticketed for everything he was doing wrong, Next day his wife got mad at him and busted a window in their house, later she burned his trailer down, ater again while \"partying\" he accidently hit the panic button on his friends house alarm causing the police to come to their rescue only to find 3 men with a pile of coke, entertaining a hooker. you aren't unlucky bro, you have bad judgement and worse taste in women.\n\nSigh.

Their salsa can be a little bit more spicier and flavorful, so this is why I give it 1 star less.  Nevertheless, their chicken is amazing.  I highly recommend paying a buck more for white meat chicken.  I usually get the half or quarter pound platter, depending on how hungry I am.  I can tell the food is fresh because there I times I take the food back and don't it eat for a few days, and it is still very juicy and flavorful after reheating it.\n\nIt is too bad some of the locations are closing down, but that is something I see a lot going on with other chains.

Plenty of most-of-the-time fresh chips and plenty of most-of-the-time fresh salsas.

When the opportunity presented itself yesterday, we were so excited to try out Southern Rail.  Great wine list--featuring one of our all-time favorite wines (The Franc)--great menu...it was idyllic.  \n\nWe decided to start with sharing a gumbo appetizer while we figured out what our actual meal would be.  It arrived quickly, which was nice, but I have never been as disappointed in a dish served to me at a restaurant as I was with that gumbo. I presume Chef Beckett knows what a roux is, but this gumbo was completely lacking a roux as its base.  This gumbo tasted like brown water with some chunks of chicken and sausage thrown into it with a scoop of rice.  My husband grew up in New Orleans, and his Cajun aunt taught me how to make a proper roux and gumbo.  If I order gumbo at a restaurant, I expect it to be better than what I can make at home (which is pretty tasty if I do say so myself) or at the very least to have a decent roux, and to say this gumbo was disappointing doesn't even scratch the surface.  We sent the gumbo back (I have never before sent back a dish), finished our wine, and left.  It wasn't worth even trying anything else on the menu, wasting precious date night time or money!  \n\nI really hope this was just some kind of weird fluke and that the entire menu isn't as completely lackluster as the gumbo, but I won't be back to give it another shot.", "review_stars": 1, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 3, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "A few weeks ago...\nThe crispy duck leg confit was reduckulously good.

This restaurant is fantastic! To each his own. My guess is some folks might not know food or understand the restaurant's concept. If you are looking for traditional Southern food this might not work for you since it is a fusion, modern type of fare. \n\nLet's start with the decor. Very low key, rustic type of warehouse. It was not part of the original structure, as others incorrectly mentioned, but an add on. I asked and was told it was constructed new not redesigned. The feel of the original building, which is now Changing Hands Bookstore and First Draft Bar, were taken into account. The restaurant has very pretty chandeliers and low key ceiling art. My guess is they were trying to replicate a rail dining cart with big windows, lots of light, and that huge clock on the wall that reminds me of a rail station clock. The bar is to the east and the tables are all just lined up to the west. Very simple elegance and grace. The only thing I noticed missing, and even suggested, is that they need an \"architectual\" type of pineapple sign or wall hanging at the door since they did not incorporate one into any of the wall designs. This is steeped in southern tradition as a welcome.\n\nNow on to the \"loud\" comments. I never even noticed the \"Too Loud\" thing and I am very sensitive to loud noises. After reading the reviews we did notice it was loud. However, we loved it. We enjoyed seeing the joy and celebration on the other patron's faces. The community table was having a blast! We felt that It was not shockingly loud but yes I suppose it is a fun place being part of a bar and all. If we wanted quiet we would go somewhere else. I would never have noticed if my friend did not want to know what the reviewers were saying while we ate. She made me look it up. lol.  I would never dream of taking stars off of a restaurant for something like that since it is the theme of the place. I would just note it as a tip or a comment in the review. At no time could I not hear my friend or servers so it could not have been that loud and the place was packed. ( We got there early and reservations at the \"Rail\" are suggested) \n\nOf course one wants to know about the food. It's totally fantastic. With one of the top noted chef's in AZ how could it not be. Now it is different so be forewarned.  Open you mind to the notion. I know a challenge for most Arizonians. lol. I got the Meatloaf Special. It came with these bread pudding sticks. My guess is these are the chef's version of Southern Hush Puppies. I asked the waitress but she did not know what Hush Puppies were. That kind of shocked me. lol --Even Ms. Nyer here knows what a Hush Puppy is. Two stars off for that. (Insert sarcasm marks here)  These Bread pudding Hush Puppies, which I will call BPHP from now on, were divine! Also, my Meatloaf was out of this world. My friend had the Chicken and Dumplings. She was expecting chicken and dumplings on a plate and not the broth based type of dish she got. She could not stop raving about it. I tried it. Okay, twice but \"Shhhhhhh\" don't tell. It was mouth watering. The Dumplings were so crazy good. Since it was my birthday we had to have desert. My friend got the Bread Pudding and I got the Beignets. We shared. We thought we would take home  leftovers. Nope. The Bread Pudding here is sinful and the donuts are huge. Actually, one of the donuts made it home for next day breakfast but the Bread Pudding was a goner. I have to say Piggy noises could be heard while the pudding was being inhaled. Okay, Pigs are southern, right? ;) I could come here every day just for the dessert. I heard the Coconut cake here is to die for too and I love Coconut cake. \n\nSome people mentioned that service needs to be fine tuned. Well, they must have fixed that up real quick because our service was great. Despite being very busy and a popular place the service was wonderful. I was even walked to the bathroom by a manager. Many folks were walking the floor and stopped by to greet us. Our server was delightful, well in all ways except for the not knowing what a Hush Puppy was. Okay, I have to let that go.  I am kidding of course, for those who do not know me. But really? She does not know what a Hush Puppy is and works in a Southern themed establishment. Again, kidding, our server was really great. Teacher here taught her something new so I am happy. I wish I knew her name. I want to send her a hug and a Hush Puppy T- Shirt. Hahahaha! I love you pretty, wonderful, smiley blonde server, unknown name, friend.  \n\nSo, all in all my birthday dinner was great! They open in August for lunches too. I'm so there. I predict every weekend since school will have started. Parking is fine despite other review. I have never had a problem. There are lots and street parking surrounding The Newton.

Had dinner with a friend last night and we did all the recommended dishes:  fried green tomatoes, watermelon salad, and the duck and coconut cake for dessert.  I thought all the food was pretty good.  I was a little disappointed about not being able to taste/find the sausage that was in the rice that came with the duck--it would have added a nice little spice.  The coconut cake was terrific and a nice ending to the meal.\n\nThe reason for the three are things with a little work could be fixed:\n1. The restaurant is noisy--I think there is a trend that somehow the noise is supposed to be an indicator of coolness--it is a decision that restaurants have to make--it is loud but wasn't intolerable.\n2.  The service was just off--sometimes very attentive and sometimes a desert.  If you are going to suggest splitting a dish that has rice--then by all means bring a spoon out so one doesn't have to transfer the rice from one plate to another grain by grain with a knife and a fork--Obviously we would have asked for a spoon had the waiter not been in the desert mode at the time.\n3.  Again if people are splitting plates--have the good sense to bring out clean small plates between courses--they were not offered and we could not ask because again we were in the waiter desert at the moment we needed them.  \n4.  In my mind, unless specifically requested, an appetizer and a salad are two different courses and should be served separately so there is time to enjoy them.\n5.  We had a little bit of the pimento spread left over from the tomatoes and asked from some bread.  What we got was something that was spongy and white on the inside and had barely a crust on the outside--I would certainly not call it bread.  A restaurant at this level has no excuse for serving yucky bread--if you are going to serve it should be able to stand on its own as well as being a complement to whatever it is going with.  A great tasty rye would have been wonderful for the left over pimento or even a robust baguette, but certainly not what we got. \n\nSouthern Rail--I really want you to get to your act together --you are such a welcome addition to the neighborhood--It won't take much--but you have to start paying attention to the details.

The chicken that was \"pretty\" but flavorless on visit one, was perfectly seasoned and delicious on this try.  The first visit's bitter collard greens were a mess - while these were a proper mess (batch) of collards, well-complimented with a dash of hot-pepper vinegar, as opposed being a necessary disguise to the first.  The two fried pork chops, decent sized and battered with breading of similar seasoning to the chicken, were moist and delicious.  The mac n cheese, the only standout (aside from the 7-Up cake) of the first visit, was the creamy, cheesy, comfortingly delicious equal to that of the first. The experimental side of the night was the fried corn on the cob with same breading/batter, and to my surprise delicious and not remotely greasy.  There was a sizeable biscuit included with the meal, but with no butter, no jam, honey, or anything supplied to go with it, not a worthwhile inclusion. \n \n   We were welcomed on entry by the owner and told we could take our choice of seats and chose one of the large, deep, comfortable booths.  The owner checked with us a couple of times before we decided on our orders, took the orders and supplied us with our respective beverages.  There were far fewer folks working, and things frankly seemed to working far more efficiently without so many people and so much conversation among staff.  The owner, who served as our greeter, waiter, server, and cashier, was friendly and solicitous of our opinion on the food and appreciative of our compliments.  Service was adequate if not exactly attentive in the nearly empty restaurant, as our glasses ran dry for extended periods, but can be excused somewhat given the range of activities having to be covered by the one individual.  \n\nAll in all, I'm glad I made the effort to go back Down South.

A couple of them were a little spicy with jalapeno, very good overall. \n\n(3) Queso Fundido $12\nA light goat cheese fondue with bits of peppers served with blue tortilla chips. I've had this one before at the NYC location and it's consistently good.\n\n(1) Spicy Chicken + Sweet potato hash $18\nGreat breakfast dish. It came with with poached eggs and a green chile hollandaise sauce.\n\n(1) Scrambled Eggs Chiliquiles with Roasted Tomatillo Sauce\nWhite Cheddar Cheese + Creme Fraiche $14\nAnother great dish. It came with one of the same sauces as the chicken dish, but it was a solid sauce.\nI had no clue what Chiliquiles were, so here's the wikipedia for your reference:\n\nChilaquiles is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of fried or dried tortilla chips, bathed in green or red salsa or mole and broiled or grilled with a cheese topping. Sometimes chicken strips are mixed into the sauce, or the dish can be served with a fried egg on top or a strip of meat alongside.\n\nThey are most commonly eaten at breakfast time, served alongside with fried or scrambled eggs or a Mexican style grilled beef. Moreover, chilaquiles are often lauded as a cure for the common hangover.\n\nUnlike nachos, which are served as a crispy snack, chilaquiles are a main dish and are not served until the tortilla chips are thoroughly soaked and softened by the salsa. This makes them a popular recipe for stale chips or those with a bad taste as the other flavors mask the chips'.\n\n(5) Mesa Burger $16\nThe most memorable part of this dish was the price. The fries were pretty good; crispy outside, seasoned well. But, nothing special about the burger.\n\n(6) New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich with Grilled Red Onion, Arugula, and\nAncho-Chile Mayonnaise $15\nI thought this was the worst of the dishes. The beef was tender, but it lacked flavor, was too thin, was initially served cold and the bread was too thick for the sandwich. The waiter said the previous bakery burned down and they were testing new bread. The ancho mayo was good, but the flavor was overpowered by the 2 lbs. of bread.\n\n(4) Grilled Mahi Mahi with Roasted Pineapple-Cascabel Chile Sauce and Caramelized Pineapple-Green Onion Salsa $24\nI was hung over, which is the only way I could why I order this dish. The sauce was good and the fish seemed to be lightly scented with honey. The texture was a little dry. Overall, not worth $24. The waiter said it was the best thing on the menu, maybe he meant the priciest thing on the menu.\n\nMy friend got a bloody mary. I'm not a fan of tomato juice or blood for that matter, but it looked of pretty good quality. \n\nService\nVery slow.

Another freshly graduated interior designer, it seems. \n\n\"MESA\" is the big name you see no matter where you're sitting, in an oddly half-cut big block lettering. Nick commented \"I wonder if anyone told Bobby that half his letters are missing.\" The logo makes no sense with the interior design either, all of which just says to me \"failure\".\n\nI did not keep the receipt but I still remember a good part of the meal.\n\nTiger shrimp tamales, an appetizer, is an absolute must in trying Bobby's food. It is an absolute must because he always makes it. So you have to eat it, because it is his signature dish. Obviously it is his favorite, so he better do this right. And it is good. I'd hate to say it, but it's a well-made tamale. Sure not exactly Mexican, but it tastes pretty good. It had all of two shrimps. A spicy mayo sauce is gooped onto it. \n\nA ceviche turned out to be leftover bits of grouper fish tossed in lemon juice. The fish was nice and fresh, but that ain't ceviche. \n\nTwo different fish dishes were decent, good ingredients prepared by good workers. Such a pitiful thing that Bobby does is overpower everything by drowning them in sauces. You don't really taste the meat, you taste the sauce. And Tony Bourdain was right. You can tell all too easily that the sauces came out of squeeze bottles. And before then they came out of blenders. Something... that just kills the cooking essense of cooking.\n\nThe dessert was at least very good, worth going to Bobby's for. Warm chocolate crepes with strawberries, with plenty of warm goopy sauce around it.\n\nThe best part of the meal, and I've had too many experiences like this at \"fine dining\" places, was the free bread that was passed around. Corn bread with actual corn chunks (to remind you that you're eating corn bread), was a bit more crumbly than I would like (it just means crumbs everywhere!!) but it did have the corn flavor goodness. With warm butter (although that made it crumblier) it was better.\n\nI watched a steak being served to another table, and the load of peppers and sauce on top of it made me cringe.

The orange sauce for the grouper did not go well with char. The salmon seemed to have little spice. The scallops relatively bland. The pork was also overcooked, though the person ordered it well.  \n\nI was far from impressed by the food, and I didn't even have high expectations.

The blue chips were too thin, they broke when you dipped them into the fondido. Did I mention the presentation was awesome. \n\nNext we had Crispy Squash Blossoms $15.00. Filled with Ricotta Cheese, Corn and basil with yellow Haberno sauce. I think I remember 3 or 4 on the plate. It was the only appetizer we completely devoured. They were fresh, crisp and very tasty. Wish we had two orders of Blossoms. They reminded me of chile rellenos without the pepper. Encore!!\n\nNext was the Blue Corn Pancake $15.00. It had BBQ Duck and a habanero Chile -Star Anise Sauce. Nice idea, but someone spilled the Hosin sauce into the Habenero sauce and ruined the whole concept. The duck was on the dry side and the pancake tasted like a corn pancake. A little oil and butter in the batter would have done wonders to the pancake. Nice try, but it needs to be re-worked or change the price to two bucks. \n\nWild Mushroom Quesadilla, came with white bean hummus and white truffle oil. $14.00. Not a home run, but I would say at least a double. It was tasty and moist. Had some magic chile powder sprinkled on top of the tortilla that needs to be reformulated. A call to McCormick should remedy this. I think a little garlic-butter instead of the chile powder would have earned a triple with me. \n\nI'm looking forward to going back sooner than later. The appetizers were good, but I can't wait to try the steak or lamb. I really love their open kitchen and the action behind the three dedicated grills in plain view for all the customers to witness their food being grilled fresh. \n\nI'd estimate this place does 15 to 17 million in annual sales given the number of tables, the bar and the advance notice we had to give just to get a reservation.

This means I don't eat at a restaurant because a celebrity is associated with it, and therefore any feelings I may have - positive or otherwise - in regard to said celebrity, don't mess with my meal. Good food is a serious business.  It should never be adulterated with bile. \n\nTHE FOOD\nAfter consulting with the waiter, I ordered a cocktail... a Cactus Pear Margarita, a Blue Corn Pancake appetizer, and the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash.  \n\nThe Cactus Pear Margarita (Herradura Silver Tequila, cactus pear syrup and lime juice) had a strong background flavor of grapefruit, which was not to my taste.  The replacement drink was a White Peach Margarita (white peach puree, Herradura Silver Tequila, lime juice).  It was exquisite.  A perfect balance of flavors.  Not too sweet.  Not too sour.  Not excessively fruity.  \n\nMeanwhile I had the bread basket to explore. It included three breads; a jalapeno cornbread muffin, a slice of nutty whole wheat, and a few wedges of light as air foccacia.  Okay... the muffin was actually the highlight of my entire day.  Maybe several days.  Crumbly, salty sweet, just spicy enough to be interesting.  I immediately wanted a dozen more, and my appetizer hadn't even arrived.  Later I sampled the whole wheat - which was somewhat pedestrian after the muffin, and the foccacia - another delicious surprise.  I could have dined on bread alone and gone away full and happy.  But more was to come.  \n\nThe Blue Corn Pancake is just that, a blue corn pancake filled with barbecued duck, topped with at least three sauces, including the habanero chile and star anise listed on the menu.  The blend of flavors was powerful, exotic, and extremely rich.  People who cannot or don't care for spicy foods should avoid this dish.  The heat of the smoky sweet barbecued duck was balanced with the mild blue corn, then kicked again into high gear with the sauces.  Wow!\n\nThe Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash was... well, interesting.  Topped with a poached egg the combination was relatively mild.  The consistency of the whole dish was soft, almost deceptively so, because the sauces drizzled over the dish were quite spicy. I ate half and brought the rest of it home to Los Angeles to eat later.  It was actually better tasting when I heated it up the next day.  \n\nSince I was taking leftovers home, I went ahead and ordered a dessert.  The waiter and I spent some time talking about what would travel well, eventually settling on the Smoked Vanilla & Toasted Walnut Flan.  Actually, it was a coffee flavored flan with a smoky vanilla caramel top and some candied walnuts on the side. I may sound more blase than I feel, but the description on the dessert menu just did not do it justice.  Even after being hauled onto a plane and stuck in a refrigerator for a day, the flan was creamy, subtly flavored, and absolutely splendid. \n\nIn fact, the whole meal was a five star experience.  It takes a truly superb kitchen to create the effortless complexity of flavor and presentation I got at Mesa.\n\nTHE SERVICE\nI had my luggage with me when I came into the restaurant and the Greeter immediately offered to put it aside in a private locked closet. Although she didn't give me a claim ticket, she did recognize me when I left.  I did wonder how that all works when the restaurant is particularly busy.\n\nAs you can tell already, I take up a waiter's time.  I expect them to be knowledgeable about the menu, familiar with the dishes, and to have an opinion (their favorites).  I did not order the waiter's favorites, but any really good waiter appreciates fine food and WILL have at least one dish on the menu that they rave about.  Great restaurants hire great waiters.  Mesa Grill gets five stars here as well.  Not only did I have a great waiter, I had two, plus a busboy who might as well have been a third, and a personable bartender who brought me my second drink ... AND STOOD THERE waiting to make sure I was happy with it. \n\nMind you, I was there at 1:30 in the afternoon on a Monday.  So most people should not expect to get quite this level of attention, but I have no doubt that these guys are steller even at the most hectic of times. I really put them to the test at the end. I asked to have the hash and a couple of those amazing muffins packed along with the flan.  Then I had them repack it so that I could fit it into my carry on bag.  No fuss.  No looks.  Just whatever help I seemed to need.  (many thanks Joel, Dario & Adam!) \n\nI would write a longer review, but I have run out of room.  Let me just say that the environment was excellent (quiet, light enough to see, but not too bright, and the bathroom was clean), and the bill, including tip was under $75.

My halibut was flakey and moist, but if I could have done it all over again, I would have ordered the tenderloin too.\n\nThe thing I think I love the most about Mesa Grill is that the whole experience is unlike anything else I've tried.

My other fellow food goers both ordered bloody marys. I tried a sip, and I swear I was in spicy tomato heaven. It was the best bloody bloody mary I've ever had, and I actually REGRETTED not ordering one for myself. Score 1 for Bobby Flay!\n\nNext, our server set down a bounty of delicious baked goods. (good thing because we were starving) Now usually, the bread is usually just ok and filler food til the meal comes. The basket alone could have made up a meal, and I would have been perfectly content. (just goes to show you how serious they take food) The assortment came with jalepeno corn muffins and biscuits, cranberry scones, blueberry coffee cake, and the best part was that they gave us three of each because there were three of us! Now that's dedication!\n\nNext, the three of us ordered the Mesa Burger, Scrambled Egg Enchilada, and the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash with Poached Eggs. \n\nMy burger came with fries dusted with a southwestern seasoning (ancho chili powder, and probably some cayenne). The fries were delectably spicy and the burger was cooked medium (with the perfect pink center) score 2 more points for Flay.  The burger was HUGE accompanied by tasty grilled onions, swiss cheese, and a side of horseradish mustard. I could have stopped here, and Flay would have exceeded my expectations, but he was definitely not through with me yet. \n\nNext the Scrambled Egg Enchiladas. Scrambled eggs with chorizo and goat cheese rolled in tortillas, and assembled on top of three different sauces. The great thing I loved about this was that it was not drenched with sauce like your typical enchilada. Instead, there were three intricate sauces (all sure to stimulate your taste buds), that went well with the delicate eggs. Scrumptious!\n\nI was perfectly satisfied, but Flay insisted \"to keep on going\" and make the experience \"last a little longer.\"  I had to try the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash.

Not overrated at all.\n\nComing into Mesa Grill, I've really felt that Bobby Flay's such a overrated cook with a freaking ego problem. Ever seen Bobby Flay's throwdown on the food network? Annoying is all I can say.\n\nMy perspective has really changed, after dining here for a lunch. His ingredients, his hand in opening this restaurant, he can back up the s*it that he's talking. It's good, solid food. Not everything is transcendent brilliant - omg I could die right now - type of food, but a lot of his food has their moments.\n\nEven at the beginning, with the breadbasket, the experience starts. Extremely good stuff. Three different types of bread, all unique and brilliant in its own right. Jalapeno bread, Raisin Walnut bread, and Blue/Yellow cornbread muffins. The biggest highlight was the muffin - so sweet and slightly buttery for that savory taste. Even the crumbs in the breadbasket were subsequently picked out and devoured by myself.\n\nI'm lucky my girlfriend wanted some dishes from the prix fixe, so we were able to mix and match appetizers and entrees. \n\nI ordered a blue corn pancake, filled with duck in star anise sauce, with habanero sauce on top. Presentation was brilliant, flavor was excellent as well. The anise sauce tasted almost peking duck like, and had a significantly Asian feel to it with the cilantro. However, the dish was distinctly southwestern with the kick of the habanero. Very interesting how the dish crossed cultures.\n\nEntree was the Jamaican jerk chicken from the prix fixe menu, which was vastly unsatisfying and very disappointing. Flavor was decent, but you almost expect more from this dish.\n\nMy girlfriend had the Mesa burger, of which I ate half. It was a good burger, but the problem was, it was just a burger, nothing extremely special. I wasn't too impressed. However, I may have been offset in my burger opinions by just eating the Daniel Boulud burger a meal ago. Oh well.\n\nDessert came by with the prix fixe, and it was supposedly a lime sorbet, according to the server. It actually was a guava sorbet. And it has to be one of the best sorbets I've had - ever. That's saying a lot. Slightly tart flavor, but good sweetness, and key tasting of the texture of the guava sediment so commonly seen while drinking either guava juice or eating guavas. Kept the good pinkish color of the guava as well. A great end to that meal.\n\nDoes Mesa really deserve that shiny one Michelin floret (star)? I would say yes. But probably not more than that.\n\n4 stars - Solid. Some misses, but some absolutely brilliant dishes that really made me believe in this myth of Bobby Flay.

Everything we ate was delicious and the service was top notch. We started out with the tiger shrimp with tamale, the blue corn pancake with duck and the wild mushroom grits. I don't know what kind of sauce they put on the shrimp but it was soooo good. As were the wild mushroom grits with a perfectly poached egg. If they threw some bacon on that I could eat it for breakfast every day! The only slight disappointment was the blue corn pancake. I was expecting something more along the lines of a large blini and instead it was like a soft taco. \n\nFor our entrees my dad had the chicken, which I don't know if it was fried, but it had a very different crust on the outside. The bf ordered the fish, I think it was halibut and he didn't really like the accompanying sauce which he said was like bbq sauce. They also thought the portions were a bit small and their dishes didn't come with any sides. My mom had the veal with a wild rice tamale and I had the pork tenderloin with a sweet potato tamale, both of which were very generous portions and very tasty. Ok, now here comes my one gripe...yes, corn is southwestern, but if you notice, I swear everything here comes with a cornmeal-something. We started out with cornbread, then there were tamales with the shrimp, blue corn pancakes, grits, more tamales with the entrees, and if you wanted, there was even cornbread pudding for dessert. I don't think we gravitated toward cornmeal everything, but there is just a ton of it on the menu. \n\nWe were stuffed by the time dessert rolled around and we split the banana hazlenut sundae.

With there recent Michelin Star lose, I see no future regain of that star unless things greatly approve. \n\nI was seated within 5 minutes of arrival for my lunch in which they seemed to have a pretty packed house. Now when I go to a restaurant I expect to have my bread basket within 5-10 minutes once seated. I was seated for about 10 minutes when I placed my order and 5 minutes later they brought the bread. But enough about that. Of course the oh soooooooooooo good corn bread muffin was in there which is still to this day my favorite corn bread I've had and being southern I get around :)! It was tempting for me to order my favorite dish, Tiger Shrimp Tamale, but I wanted to try something new. I went with the Yucatan Chicken Tacos with grilled Onions and Peanut-Smoked Chile Barbeque sauce. Once they arrived I was kinda put off that you basically have to make the tacos yourself. Now I'm far from lazy but when I go somewhere to eat I don't want to have to put together my own food because well, I'm there to relax and put my trust in the Chefs. But aside from that the flavors were very bold and went together perfect. The Peanut-Smoked Chile Barbeque sauce had a very nice smokey taste with a good kick which is EXACTLY the kinda flavor I like. The chicken was very fatty which I wouldn't expect from a EX Michelin star restaurant but I guess thats where the EX comes into play. Overall the dish was good but I have had MUCH better from my local mexican restaurant down the street which is pretty sad.\n\nOverall this lunch was nothing like my first. The service was very decent besides the bread arrival.

It completely embodied how I feel about Vegas in general.\n\nThe walk to the restaurant through Caesar's Palace forum shops was long, twisty, and needless. Made me wonder if there were a more direct route, or the people I was with just wanted to go shopping. The walk was OK in that it did increase our appetites.\n\nOnce at Mesa, The hostess sat us down, gave us some menus, and we waited for the rest of our party to show up before being shown our table. \n\nOur table sat a dozen comfortably as it was long enough. The waiter had give his speech twice to cover each end of the table. I was looking forward to the meal; I've seen Bobby Flay on Food Network countless times.\n\nI started with the Gala Apple Salad (baby spinach, Maytag blue cheese, toasted pecans with a spicy orange vinaigrette). The salad was spicy, but lacked enough spinach to really enjoy it as a salad. the vinaigrette dominated everything to the point where you couldn't really taste the individual ingredients. There was too much of it. I did like the texture. I wasn't wowed.\n\nNext up was the Mahi Mahi fish tacos. Again, the food was good. The sauce dominated. And with a serving size so big, why did I have to ask for more tortillas? When has two ever been enough?\n\nI ordered off menu for dessert. I did enjoy the egg shaped scoops of toasted pecan ice cream.\n\nFor a meal I didn't pay for, it was good. The company was great. The service was attentive for the first 3/4 of it.  There's no way I'll be clamoring to go back anytime soon. \n\nAnd all of this is how I feel about Vegas. You look forward to these things you've heard about for years. There's a lot of waiting and wondering. There glitz and super-sized overshadows everything. Without good people, it's not really that enjoyable.\n\nNot disappointed.

So I called to move the reservation to 10:30pm and they were very helpful. I was really grateful that it wasn't an issue.\n\nWe were a little early and had to wait a few minutes for a table. No big deal since like I said, we were a bit early, but the hostess was just sort of unfriendly. Like you could tell she really didn't like her job all that much.\n\nWe were finally seated and placed our orders. We both had the Lamb Chops, which were served with a cranberry sauce along with a pumpkin tamale. The lamb chops were amazing. Perfectly cooked, HUGE and flavorful. The boy also loved the tamale - me notsomuch. I thought it was dry and overwhelmingly flavored with cinnamon. I thought it could have been much more subtle.\n\nThe service was good, but did lag a couple of times. Drink orders were forgotten and we had to flag our server down to get our check. But she was incredibly friendly and didn't seem to mind that we weren't going to order 3 courses and just wanted to get in and out.\n\nI give Mesa +3 for wonderful service and making my life much less stressful when I needed to move my reservations. +1 for a really excellent Lamb Chop and for living up to (at least) my boyfriend's expectations. -1 for being a little overpriced, but it is Vegas, so I should probably expect it.\n\nWould I go back to Mesa on another trip?

I'm not a bread person at all, and I tend to ignore the rolls that restaurants usually put out with meals, but I would go back to Mesa just for the bread.  There was an herb and asiago and a corn and chile muffin that were just incredible.  The herb and asiago was subtle but not overly so, with just the right amount of cheesiness, and the corn muffin - oh my goodness.  First of all, beautiful - the color of the chiles comes through in a red swirl that makes an appetizing contrast with the dark gold of the muffin.  Texture is spot on - soft and warm and crumbly but not dry, and when you bite into it you find whole kernels of corn tucked inside that really add a little extra.  And of course, it tastes wonderful.  The chiles really give it the perfect kick - I cannot imagine a better corn muffin.  Needless to say, but my friend and I polished off our bread basket in no time and the thoughtful waiter noticed us picking at crumbs and brought us a second.\n\nUh...so I just spent a significant fraction of my life talking about the BREAD at this place.  It was just so impressive, and I had high expectations for the rest of the meal.  Amazingly, they were not disappointed!  After devouring the second bread basket sans mercy, we ordered a ceviche sampler to start.  The sampler was very pretty, with four square plates each holding spoons topped with tiny tiny tiny little mounds of various ceviches.  Each ceviche had a different flavor to it, and they were all quite good, and we managed to share through some surgical utensil usage.  This was probably the least memorable course, if only because there just wasn't enough tasting to get acquainted, but still superb.\n\nFor our entrees I ordered the pan-seared halibut and my friend ordered the chile relleno.  I think I had the better entree, but both were fantastic.  The chile was a thing of beauty, huge and crusted in cornmeal, sitting on a little pool of colorful sauces.  I tried a few bites and it was goooood.  My halibut was heavenly.  The fish was perfectly cooked, and the sauce was incredible!  The flavor was really deep and rich, almost like a zesty barbecue, and it worked magically with the mild fish.  Sweet red onions were also a nice touch.\n\nThis being our last night in Vegas, we weren't about to skip dessert, and we ordered a fresh berry tart with strawberry creme fraiche ice cream and an empanada with peach, mango, and cream cheese filling with a white peach tequila sorbet.  (Seriously, how do you see that described on the menu and not order it?)  Both were exceptional.  The tart was one of the best fruit tarts I've ever had.

The meal had such a rich flavor and was wonderfully complimented by the Cornmeal Crusted Anaheim Chile Relleno and, believe it or not, the Roasted Brussel Sprouts with Walnuts and Pomegranates.  Insanity!\n\nI also really enjoyed the emphasis Mesa puts on their Tequila selection. They have over 30 brands of Tequila in Blanco and Anejo styles to fit your taste, and since Tequila fits my taste it was quite a nice way to try new styles.  \n\nAt least go for tequila and an app or two.

Going in to dinner, I could not help but hope that Ben Bernanke et al. would backstop our bill - as he did for Jamie Dimon when JP Morgan stepped in to rescue Bear Stearns - if the meal turned out to be \"toxic.\" \n\nWhen walking into Mesa Grill, one is bombarded by the variegated interior - blues, greens, oranges, and reds.

First, it was oily. Second, I have heretofore never understood what people mean when they said that lobster can be chewy if poorly cooked. Just to cut through the tail meat required quite a bit of effort; not even Fletcherizing would have helped. Third, while the lobster claw provides a dramatic presentation, removing the meat meant that I would have to drench my fingers in the aforementioned oily liquid. Chief among the dish's auspicious elements was the sinus-clearing broth. Coriander balanced the sweet scallop and mussels. Both the blue corn stick and the walnut and raisin-studded bread also served as a palate emollient.\n\nAs for the rabbit, pardon the untenable Rachael Ray reference, but yum-o. The meat on the rack was, as always, difficult to access. Floating in the jus, the loin and leg were so tender. After finishing the rabbit, I still faced a sizable portion of risotto. Seeing a pile of peas was a thrill, given the paucity of vegetables in the meal, and to my surprise, they were not overcooked. My only gripe was the bean sprouts' length, which made for inelegant eating.\n\nMy companion went with the pork tenderloin. This was a well-seasoned and balanced combination.

Our waitress, who had worked in the restaurant since the day they opened, was passionate and insightful about what to drink and what to eat.\n\nPlanning ahead that I was likely to enter into a \"Food-coma\" our party of four tried to pace ourselves while also sampling what we hoped were the best dishes the restaurant had to offer.\n\nTo begin our meal, we sampled two different margaritas.  One was a original version and one a Cactus Pear version.  Both were delicious and quite strong.\n\nOur waitress started us off with a bread basket filled with blue-corn muffins, jalapeno cheddar roles, and even more types indescribable bread that likely will have you begging for more before your drinks even arrive.\n\nFor appetizers, we selected the Tiger Shrimp Tamale, the Spicy Tuna + Salmon Tartares, and Sophie's Chop Salad.  The Tamale was one of the greatest appetizers I have ever eaten and the actual corn tamale stuffing itself was licked dry.  The Tartares were spicy yet packed with flavor and came with plantain chips that were sweet and crispy.  The Salad was OK flavor-wise but had really nice textures and was a big in size.\n\nFor our entrees, we each tired something different.  I ordered the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin, which was served with an amazingly flavorful sweet potato tamale.  The pork was perfectly cooked, ultra juicy and was demolished off of the plate rather quickly.  The other three entrees chosen consisted of Blue Corn Crusted Halibut, Sixteen Spice Chicken, and a special of Tempura Soft Shell Crab.  Each dish was completely devoured, along with a side dish of a Chile Relleno, which I wish we had ordered two of.  If given a choice of my second favorite entree (the Pork was first), I would definitely choose the Chicken.\n\nDessert is always a must when dining with me, so as a table we decided to split three of them.  The Strawberry Shortcake, the Mango-Blackberry Crostada, and the Cookie Sampler.  Once again, everything suddenly was missing, despite our stomachs at capacity level.\n\nThe service was phenomenal from beginning to end, and once our waitress found out we were celebrating my graduation, she brought over a small dish of pineapple ice cream with a candle.\n\nIf you happen to find yourself in Las Vegas, please do yourself a favor and stop by Mesa Grill.

They all usually start by saying something to the effect of, \"I don't care for Bobby Fley's TV shows\" or \"I'm not the biggest Fley fan..\" and then is always followed up by the same but: : \"...The meal was amazing\" or \"...You have to try it when your in Vegas\"  And if you are constantly bombarded by hearing statements like these over and over again, it's hard to avoid coming in with your expectations raised.  \n\nFor those looking for the cliff notes version:  It didn't disappoint.\n\nHere is the long version:\n\nFirst things should note is that the service here was simply exemplary, our server (Brian) was attentive and but was able to keep it from feeling stuffy and overbearing, and considering we were in the middle of dinner service and the place was buzzing with energy, for some reason things didn't feel quite that way with him taking care of us.  Talking to him about the dishes, his personal recommendations and even his check ups on us came regularly but he managed to not disrupt the mood of our dinner conversations.  Busers, were circulating constantly and kept refilling my water (I drink alot of it) without the need for me to keep asking and they kept the bread coming.  Oh man, the yellow/blue cornbread with bits of pepper in it with the creamy honey butter was so damn tasty...  They kept that coming too, but it took my g/f and a knife to keep my advances on the bread bowl at bay since we had a ton more food coming...\n \nStarter - Blue corn pancake with Barbecued Duck and a Habanero Chile-Star Anise Sauce:\n\nSuch a mixture of complex bold flavors, really bold.  The duck was moist, richly seasoned, the sauces hit every single taste bud:  heat, smokiness, the anise provided a very deep level of different flavors, the blue pancake was super thin, light and fluffy and in texture reminded me of a Chinese pancake/roast duck dish I was familiar with, but the similarities ended there, the flavors totally scream to me what Flay is all about.  Superb.\n\nNew Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin in a Bourbon-Ancho Chile Sauce and a Sweet Potato Tamale + Crushed Pecan Butter\n\nMy g/f ordered this dish, so I got to pick at it a bit, from the bites that I got in I have to say the meat was superb, well seasoned, nice char on the outside and the meat was perfectly cooked.  The sweet potato tamale with pecan butter was rich and sweet and was a nice change of pace with the rest of the dish.\n\nChipotle glazed in bone rib eye with a currant chile reduction sauce and a Pumpkin tamale + thyme butter\n\nThe two little rib eye pieces were also perfectly cooked, the sauce had a very subtle sweetness to it with a touch of heat.  The meat had a nice smokiness to it, and there was a nice char to the meat on the outside with a bloody awesome in the middle.  The pumpkin tamale provided a sweetness to the dish, personally I liked the sweet potato tamale more.\n\nA side of a Chile relleno\n\nA stuffed chile deep fried, anything tastes better when it's stuffed and deep fried.\n\nTres Leches Flan\n\nRich creamy texture, the caramel sauce and the light crisp cookie on top was just....  (I'm running out of words and synonyms to describe something as good)...  Each bite was absolutely intoxicating.  Each bite had a little bit of caramelized sauce, creamy vanilla infused flan and cookie crisp.\n\nSo to sum up, fantastic food, great drinks and amazing service.  The evening was perfect and more importantly it lived up to and surpassed my expectations, and considering Vegas is home to a number fantastic restaurant, Mesa grill is definitely a worth-while stop.  I'm pretty sure I will be making a stop off in New York sometime soon and check out Fley's other restaurant.

I'm talking about someone who will sit down next to you and engage you a bit, instead of just feigning interest and listlessly read through the specials.\n\nIn short, the food here is a flavor explosion in your mouth.  For starters, I recommend the very rich Goat Cheese Queso Fundido and the flavorful Yucatan Chicken Tacos even though the portion sizes are small for the price.  A selection of complimentary breads comes with the meal and they are quite unique.  Use caution with the Blue Corn Cake Muffin, though, because it's very crumbly and likely to end up all over you if you aren't careful.  \n\nFor the entr\u00e9e, I can't rave enough about the New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin.  I've never had Pork that cuts like butter and rests in the perfect amount of spicy goodness.  Other contenders are the Coffee rubbed filet mignon and the chipotle glazed rib-eye.

First, the reservations; when you call ahead you have to give them your credit card number so they can charge you $50 a head in the event that you don't show up without cancelling before 3pm the same day.  That seems ridiculous to me considering that they would have no problem filling the seats with walk ups.  Second, the food is pricey for the quantity.  I know its Vegas, but a little bigger portion for the appetizers wouldn't hurt them too much.  Finally, if you come with a big party they stick you in a not so attractive back room on a large folding table covered with a cloth.  Aside from being a bit tacky, it makes you feel isolated from the bustling atmosphere in the main dining room.

The idea of a \"fine dining\" experience featuring \"Southwestern cuisine\" seemed like an oxymoron. I could not fathom how this particular genre of food would be successfully executed at an elevated level, because quality Tex-Mex ingredients are not expensive, rare, or difficult to prepare. I've been to local mom and pop restaurants in New Mexico and Texas that served fantastic and memorable chili relleno's, taco's, salsas with roasted chili's, creamy black beans, spiky queso fresco (sp?), and fresh blue corn tortilla's made by hand. Putting an ancho chili spice rub on a pork loin just doesn't seem to justify the price tag. \n\nA friend of mine dined at Mesa Grill, and so enjoyed his experience he requested a visit on our upcoming Vegas trip. I trusted his palate considering he is a product of culinary school, but I should've considered his admiration for chef Flay might sway his better judgement. \n\nMesa Grill is right around the corner from Pure nightclub, (which I suggest attending, you'll have a great time). The decor is quite loud, but I must say A+ for the grill design on the ceiling. Clever. \n\nThe staff. Our waitress seemed flighty. She might have been new, so I'll excuse her erratic behavior. First, she forgot our bottled water, then proceeded to argue with us that we did not request bottled. I don't mind if you forget our water preference, but to argue with us is ridiculous. Then she forgets to inform us of the specials. We overheard the specials from the waiter serving the table next to us. When she came back with our water, we informed her that we wanted hear the specials. Again, she argues with us and tells us she already told us. \"So all four of us are lying?\" I asked. She then told us to \"hold on\" as she double checked the specials. Interesting, considering she claims she had already informed us. Nonetheless, one of our friends ordered the special seared scallop dish with a chili orange glaze. \n\nThe drinks. My friend ordered a mango mojito that was nice and refreshing. I ordered a kir royale. They used Chambord instead of cassis, which I didn't love, because I tasted the liquor as opposed to the sweet, tangy cassis. \n\nThe food. We opted to start with the spiced duck taco's, queso fresco dip with blue corn tortilla chips, and deep fried squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta cheese, and basil. The duck taco's were savory, but reminded me of a Peking duck dish served at one of my favorite Chinese restaurants. Unoriginal. Tortillas stuffed with duck, a plum flavored sauce, cilantro, green onions, and shredded cabbage. The queso dip wasn't horrible. It was a cheese dip with chips. Not really interesting. The squash blossoms were crunchy, but the ricotta and basil were a little too assertive for my taste. I lost the flavor of the blossoms in the goop of the ricotta.  The basil was a little too sharp. \n\nAside from our one friend, we all ordered the coffee spiced filet, with a corn tamale, and horseradish potato gratin. The filet was cooked perfectly, and the coffee spiced rub wasn't bad. Although, I like to taste my meat. I am a violent carnivore, and I love ripping into a juicy, bloody, fatty, piece of meat. I know, its an illness. In hindsight I probably shouldn't have ordered the spiced rubbed meat, but I needed to decide for myself if spiced meat was a delicious option. Unfortunately, not so. The spices in the rub didn't compliment the meat, as much as it overpowered it. The spices failed to dissipate, so I cleared my palate after every bite. The horeradish potatoes were good, and the corn tamale was nice and moist, but like every other corn tamale I've had at any generic Mexican restaurant. For dessert we ordered an exotic sorbetto Napoleon: Guava, passionfruit, and mango sorbetto, with a carmel crisp. Yummy. \n\nI walked away from my experience feeling ripped off. I wasn't impressed. As a professional digester I never look at prices. It's insulting to the food. Sadly, I wanted my money back. I felt cheated. I want to walk away from a meal feeling satiated, not calculating the costs. \n\nSide note: My uncle wanted to celebrate his birthday at Mesa Grill, and to our surprise, and luck, Chef Flay was in the kitchen. He came out to greet the patrons, and was very nice. He patiently chatted with my 89 year-old grandma, as she professed her love for him, and was kind enough to take a picture with her. He asked if the food was to our liking, then sent over a signed cookbook.

While the presentation and flavors were all there, the hash was more of a mash and when you combine that with really tender chicken, you get mush. The creamy grits were a winner, but I really regret pairing that with the mushy chicken/hash. A little bit of textural contrast may have made this good.

We had an awesome, attentive, friendly, sweet waiter who really did an awesome job. The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated. The table was large and the seating was comfortable. \n\nWhen it comes to the food though...I just wasn't that impressed :( I had really high hopes for Mesa...I have heard so many people tell me how much they love it and how it will be some of the best food I will ever eat. I beg to differ.\n\nLet me break it down, we had a LOT of food, so I feel like me giving 3 stars for food is justified:\n\nAppetizers - Goat Cheese \"Queso Fundido\", Tiger Shrimp & Roasted Corn Tamale, Blue Corn Pancake with Duck, Yucatan Chicken Tacos. \n\nWe ordered four appetizers for five people. That should be enough, right? Wrong. These appetizers are tiny. And expensive for the portion you receive! The total for just the appetizers was $60. Yes, 6-0 dollars. One appetizer was barely enough for two people. And let me state for the record, I have no problem throwing down money for good food, but I thought it was absolutely ridiculous the amount charged for tiny little bites of food.\n\nBut how did it taste, you ask? Okay. The cheese dip was awesome. I will give Mr. Flay that - he can make a mean cheese dip. But, if you didn't eat it fast enough, it hardened. So, eat quickly when you order the queso! The shrimp tamale was also pretty good. The shrimp were large and juicy, the corn filling was nice and flavorful, which a yummy cilantro cream sauce. The blue pancake with duck was alright...I wouldn't eat it again. It was shredded duck in a super rich BBQ sauce, just okay. The chicken tacos were served with red onions and \"chile BBQ sauce\" that tasted just like Thai food...pad thai to be exact. \n\nSides - Glazed Baby Carrots with brown sugar, Roasted Corn with smoked chile's and Cotija cheese, Saut\u00e9ed Spinach, Sweet Potato Tamale with Pecan Butter.\n\nI tried all of these sides. This place is like Ruth's Chris where you order your meat, and everything else on the side, your entree doesn't come with anything.\n\nThe baby carrots had a nice flavor, but they were a little undercooked for my taste. I prefer softer carrots. The sweet potato tamale with pecan butter - sounds awesome right? Sounds sweet and delicious, right? Well, it tastes like Masa. The saut\u00e9ed spinach was literally just that. Spinach. Now, I love spinach, and I can eat it plain or dressed up, but when I pay $8 for spinach, I would expect some garlic, or salt...or anything...nope. This was seriously cooked spinach with no other flavors. \n\nThe Roasted Corn was the star of the sides. It was absolutely delicious. The corn kernels were crisp and fresh, served in an awesome creamy, cheesy sauce that was spicy, but not too overpowering. Just awesome. \n\nEntrees - Coffee Rubbed Filet MIgnon, Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin.\n\nThree of us had the filet, the other two had the pork. Since I can't eat pork, I don't want to say much about it, but I will say BF said it was good, but not the best ever. Maybe if he ever gets on the ball and starts Yelping again, he can tell you about it himself.\n\nThe filet...very large cut of meat, too much to finish. It was soft, it was coffee rubbed, it didn't really taste like anything. The coffee rub was more of a burnt crust. I got a hint of coffee, but mostly I just tasted burn. \n\nIt was served on some mushroom, ancho chile sauce. The mushrooms were very good. Spicy and caramelized. I loved the sauce...but the filet? I would rather go to Ruth's Chris. honestly.\n\nAfter dinner our friends ordered dessert and coffee. I tried the coffee, good flavor. I took a bite of their Pineapple Buttermilk Upside Down Cake - it was very good, rich, sweet, served with a caramelized rum sauce. \n\nOverall, this place was just alright. There were a few things that hit high notes with me, but they were appetizers and sides, and I don't think I would come back just for those items.

I'm drooling on my desk just typing about it.\n\nWe showed up on a Sunday night a few minutes early for our reservation and were seated immediately by the stunningly gorgeous hostess. Our server's name was Brian and he was very helpful and attentive without being obtrusive. The bread basket had three different and equally amazing temptations -- an asiago sourdough, a wheat bread with raisins and walnuts, and a marbled corn muffin made from yellow and blue corn meal, with bits of infused pepper, and a great little ramekin of delicious butter formed into a perfect little cylinder. The margaritas came out, delivered by another server, a drink runner I suppose. My buddy ordered a regular margarita and I tried their signature drink, the cactus prickly pear margarita. We were both stunned at how delicious the drinks were. I've had hundreds of margaritas all over the country, and I can't think of another that tasted as good... Margaritas are all about proper proportions of ingredients, and these were spot on. I can only surmise that fresh squeezed juices and masterful mixing knocked these out of the ballpark for us.\n\nOur starters came out -- I ordered the grilled asparagus salad with toasted pecans, maytag blue cheese, roasted wild mushrooms + red chile-mustard vinaigrette. Perhaps the weakest link of the food we ordered, but still very good. My buddy had the crispy squash blossoms with ricotta, corn, sweet and hot yellow pepper sauce. This was the bomb and I was kinda jealous though I did manage to steal a few bites. Portion sizes were good, fairly generous, and the presentations were nice. Go squeeze bottle!\n\nNext came the entrees. I got the New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with bourbon ancho chile sauce and sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter. This plate really knocked my socks off... so tasty, so delicate, so beautifully and creatively presented. And quite a generous portion of perfectly cooked tenderloin. The sauces were complex -- a perfect balance of sweet, salty and spicy. I'm not a huge sweet potato fan, but the tamale, topped with the savory, nutty butter was so delicious. My buddy had the 22oz bone-in chipotle glazed rib-eye with red and green chile sauce. He ordered it medium rare and charred, and it arrived at the table exactly as ordered. It's huge! It reminded us of the steak that tipped over Fred Flinstone's car. I tried a couple of bites and it was amazing. I'm not one who usually eats the gooshy fatty parts, but the charring give it a very pleasant melt-in-my-mouth texture that made me rethink that tendency. For us, both entrees were home runs, knocked out of the ballpark. We also split a chile relleno, which I believe was filled with white cheddar. It was great.\n\nWe were absolutely stuffed and though curious about their desserts, decided to pass. This was a memorable and exciting culinary experience for us both, and I absolutely have new respect for Chef Flay. To the servers and cooks who made this meal so perfect and memorable, I salute you!

Geez, it's just tequila.  I took the waiter's recommendation and was not disappointed.  It was not cheap, maybe $15, by the time the extra options were added up.  It was delicious.  \n\nAppetizers were next.  The Queso Fundido (Blue corn chips and a hot cheeze dip) was wonderful.  Cheesy and spicy.  Tiger shrimp and roasted garlic corn tamales were just amazing.  Kind of small portions but the tastes were unique and complementary.  We also had the blue corn crusted squid.  Lightly crunchy with a tangy sauce.\n\nI had the blue corn crusted halibut.  Off the chart fantastic.  I love a simple piece of grilled meat or fish with a plain starch and veggie.

I realized mid-meal it was his restaurant when the waiter at the table next to me was explaining to the recently seated couple that \"Mr Flay likes a little spice so beware all of our dishes have a little kick\" (they were an older couple). I know i'm slow after he said that, that's when i realized why they had his cookbooks in the front. :)  (but like i said had a horrible trip so i wasn't even looking for things like this) anyway onto the food.\n\nFOOD: fantastic.  I went on sunday and i got the eggs and aged striploin tortilla (fancy name for steak and eggs) and  it was yummy.  It came with all this spices of sorts (well they werent spices).

The bar menu didn't list all their beers, just the imported foo-foo ones which had my husband scratching his head until the bartender told him the domestic beers weren't listed but they do serve them.

I don't usually eat pork so I chickened out at the last second and got the Southwestern Spiced Duck Breast. Once again, I fell in love with the sauce, Carrot-Habanero Sauce. It complimented the meat beautifully! There was a side of the Chorizo-Goat Cheese Tamale and it melted in my mouth.

He gave us the time to peruse the brunch menu & ask a few questions -- he, too, made a few suggestions -- the Mesa Grill margarita & Mesa Grill burger.\n\nHubby ordered a MG margarita (Loved it!) -- I stuck with water for brunch.  Then service slowed down,  I guess the kitchen was backed up, and our waiter was relatively attentive (until \"bill\" time -- when they all seem to disappear).\n\nWe ordered the Tenderloin Tartar for an appetizer -- great flavors -- capers & a nice amount of acid with a creamy caper aoili on top, with grilled bread as a side.  Nice flavors -- hit the spot -- set a high standard.\n\nWe also received the typical breadbasket with some hits & some misses -- the blue corn muffins were so dry they were almost inedible, but the blueberry crumble bar was divine & the little corn muffins with fresh jalapenos were delicious.  The cranberry & fruit/nuts muffin was ok.\n\nOur entrees, however, were not up to par.  Hubby got the MG Burger, ordered medium with a pink center.  Flavors were good, bread was nice, tomatoes were fresh; but, even though the burger was pink in the middle, it was incredibly dry -- almost inedible.  Not sure why?  Pulled off grill to sit & wait during the rush?\n\nI ordered the spicy chicken with sweet potato hash w/ poached eggs and green chile hollandaise.  The eggs & hollandaise were great -- would order again if I could have them on some other starch.  The chicken-sweet potato hash was incredibly sweet -- not enough savory or heat to offset the sweetness.  It was way, way beyond the average sweetness of a baked sweet potato -- not sure what was added to make it so sweet.  I ended up eating the eggs, etc. off of the hash & leaving the rest.\n\nThen, it was time to leave -- and our ever-attentive waiter disappeared.  We ended up doing the \"leave the credit card on the table\" trick to get his attention, so we didn't even look at the bill before he took our credit card -- but, we were just happy to have him swipe the card & get going.\n\nThe Tendeloin tartar was all Chef Flay can be, but the signature MG Burger was so far short of our expectations and. I'm sure, of Chef Flay's expectations, that I would have to believe the burger was a fluke.  The chicken-sweet potato hash needs reworking as far as I'm concerned.  Not enough heat or flavor profile to offset the sweet.  \n\nGo back?  Probably not -- Las Vegas has enough other wonderful restaurants that I'm not inclined to start repeating until we've gone through most of the other ones.  It's a shame -- I do like Chef Flay's cooking, even though I like to joke about the plethora of chipotles.\n\nChef Flay -- please look into these comments -- I realize you have restaurants all over the country -- but when your line cooks can't get your signature burger right -- you have to wonder.  I truly hate to give you 3 stars, I had hoped it would be an out-of-the-ballpark 5 star brunch; but with high expectations and the high standards that I'm sure you set for your kitchen staff, I was more than slightly disappointed in the quality and character of the food we received.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I admit it.

Great mixture of cheeses.  There were not enough of the blue corn chips though.  Come on Bobby... for another penny or two throw a few more of those on the plate!  For lunch, the pork tenderloin sandwich was very good.  The panini style sandwich was crispy, and the spices were perfect and the pork was tender.  The only real downside was the size... not too much filling the sandwich.  The southwestern fries that came with it were not very good at all... more points off.  Some were soggy and/or oily, and the seasoning was just meh.  Points could have been added if a good dipping sauce came with it.  I stole my buddies horseradish mustard to use.\n\nService was very good overall with a few flaws.  We did not get the basket of bread until half way through our meal, and they were a bit slow on the response when we needed something.

For 2 burgers, 1 pork sandwich, 1 app and regular drinks... the bill was very close to $100 with tax and tip.

Perhaps the man can cook.  Plus, we were in the mood for mexican-like food.\n\nLesson learned: go with your first instinct.\n\nWe were there for brunch, and my date got a Mesa burger which was small but presented very nicely.  The flavor was just OK and the burger itself was mediocre, but the grilled onion and horseradish mustard on the burger were very tasty.  Southwestern fries were a bit firey and a little on the greasy side, but were an OK complement to an OK burger.\n\nI ordered Sophie's chopped salad and asked the waiter to give me a quick run-down of the veggies in it.  However, when it came, i found out that it had olives, which he failed to mention.  Because the olive-flavor was so overpowering (and i dislike olives), i had to send it back.  My date dug into his sandwich, and my replacement salad did not come until he was nearly done the meal.  Check minus on service.  \n\nI wouldn't be upset about the delay-time in getting my meal had this been my fault...however when you put something like olives (same goes for mushrooms or onions) in a chopped salad and the diner inquires , you should be sure to remember to list the components that have strong or polarizing flavors.  He may have just forgotten but it was not busy at that hour, so I was a bit ticked (and hungry).\n\nSide note - the bread basket had some decent items.  The blue corn cornbread muffins were really dry, the jalapeno bites were hit-or-miss on the \"heat\" factor depending on which you ate (perhaps some were mild and others spicy?), and the mini breakfast pastries were very good on sweetness and consistency.  Stick to those for your pre-brunch-calorie-consumption.  \n\nThe only redeeming part of the meal were the cocktails.  I had a tequila/Fresca cocktail that was light, refreshing, and not too sweet. it was delicious.  My date had a margarita which he claimed to be one of the best he's had...don't know how helpful that is, though, as he's generally not a margarita-guy.\n\nOverall, food was mediocre at the high points and awful at the low points, service was spotty, drinks were great.

There's a vinagrette, some kind of sundried tomato sauce, and some kind of avocado sauce.  I liked the vinagrette best.\n-Veal chop with wild rice tamale.  I think this dish has the signature Mesa Grill tastes.  It's basically a really good cut of meat that has been perfectly grilled, with a very nice and slightly spicy sauce on it (some kind of pepper/chipotle sauce) and some demiglace.  Very tender and flavorful on its own with a little zing from the sauce, but not overpowered by the sauce.  The tamale is a nice side.\n-Green chile ciopinno.  Fish, shrimp, scallops, mussels, and lobster in an excellent green chile broth.  This one is hard to describe; the flavors are pretty unique.  Just try it yourself, it's excellent.\n-Corn flan with caramel.  I'm not a huge fan of flan, but this is the best flan I've ever had.

My party had reservations for 10 for 12:30 and arrived about 15 minutes early ... but weren't seated until 15 minutes past our reservations. Given they had known we were coming for nearly a month, and we'd confirmed the reservations earlier that day, they should have made sure everything was ready. The delay *wasn't* because the tables were all full, incidentally - where we sat was empty and clean and waiting for us when we arrived. I'm also less than happy about the upsell for bottled water - they didn't offer ice water when we seated (just bottled water - sparkling or flat) and implied tap water was not available.\n\nMy party ended up ordering the Goat Cheese (\"Queso Fundido\") with rajas and tortilla strips as an appitizer, and getting baskets of bread with a ciobatta, some sort of wheat bread with cranberries in it, and a chile cornbread. The Queso Fundido which was creamy and a little spicy and very delicious, and I could have happily eaten an entire order by myself. It wasn't as spicy as I had expected it to be, but that's ok, it was perfect with the goat cheese. The ciabatta and the wheat bread were great (I did eat almost the entire basket of that). I liked the chile cornbread, but thought it was really weak in the spice department and it was cold in the middle, like they had baked a bunch and froze them and just reheated it for lunch and got it in long enough that it was all thawed and the outsides were warmish, but the middle was still ice cold.\n\n\nFor entrees, many people ordered the Mesa Burger (double cheddar, grilled vidalia onion, and horseradish mustard on a house roll with southwest fries). One person ordered the Pressed Cuban Burger (which was a burger with ham, swiss cheese, pickles, dijon mustard, and roasted garlic mayo with adobo fries). I ordered the Grilled Mahi Mahi, which came with a roasted pineapple-cascabel chile sauce and a pineapple-green onion salsa. One person ordered the Yucatan Chicken Tacos (with grilled red onion and a peanut smoked chile BBQ sauce), and the person next to me ordered the New Mexico-style Pork Tenderloin Sandwich (with grilled red onion, arugula, ancho-chile mayo, and southwest fries).\n\n\nI quite enjoyed the Mahi Mahi. The pineapple-chile sauce was spicy enough to give a nice kick to the fish, and the pineapple-onion salsa gave a balancing sweetness. I ended up using some bread to mop up the last of the chile sauce because it was that good (and I was that hungry!). Everyone else seemed to quite enjoy their lunches as well.\n\nPrice-wise, there was some grumbling at the end that it was a little expensive for what you get.

I have always wanted to try his menu and ever since I found out he had a restaurant in Las Vegas, I been waiting for the next time I went to eat at Mesa Grill.  Well after going to vegas for 4 times and NOT having the chance to eat at Mesa Grill, I finally got to go eat lunch at Mesa Grill this past weekend.\n\nI would have much rather come here for dinner, since it has a wider variety than lunch, but I was still very excited none the less.  Everyone in my group got their own lunch entree, and a few of us shared a couple appetizers.  For appetizers, I got to try the Blue Corn Pancake, Rough Cut Tuna Nachos, and the Spicy Beef Tenderloin Tartare.\n\nBlue Corn Pancake - I LOVED this appetizer! Bobby Flay is known for his chili sauces, and it did not disappoint!  The sauce went soo well with the tender duck and soft pancake.  The only bad thing about this dish was that there was not enough of it!\n\nRough Cut Tuna Nachos - I love raw appetizers, tuna and salmon dishes especially. The Mango and Habanero hot sauce mixture was very different for me, but still good. \n\nSpicy Beef Tenderloin Tartae - It said it comes with a green onion potato salad but I have no idea where that was.  It was presented with the tenderloin tartare, a few pieces of toast, and shitake mushrooms.  My first time eating raw beef in a tartare form and I really liked it.  It was good by itself, or piled onto the toasted bread and a piece of the shitake mushroom.\n\nWhile everyone else chose a burger or sandwich, I tried to be different and went along with the Mahi Mahi with roasted pineapple sauce and, caramalized pineapple, and creamy green chili rice.  I'm terribly sorry to say Bobby Flay, but this is probably one of the worst dish I have ever ordered.  The mahi mahi was tasteless and very dry, and it did not go well with the rest of the dish.  I enjoyed eating the little pieces of pineapple and the rice more than the main part of the dish.  My friend had said, \"the one person that wanted to go here the most, ordered the worst\" Minus 1 star for this dish, or else it would've been a 5 star restaurant to me.\n\nHowever, I was able to try the New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich and the Pressed Cuban Burger, both which was amazingly good, especially the Pressed Cuban Burger.  When I first read it on the menu, I was confused because it didn't mention a burger patty, just smoked ham, and I did not want it.  What a big mistake! The smoked ham along the juicy burger and swiss cheese, pickles, and roasted garlic mayonnaise was to die for! Probably one of the best burgers I have ever had in my life. The New Mexican Spiced Pork sandwich was a little simpler tasting, but still very good. The pork was well seasoned and not try like most pork pieces would be.\n\nTwo of my friends ordered from the pri fixe menu that came with a chocolate dessert that we all got to sample.  I'm not sure what it is because it just said \"Chef's Dessert of the Day\" but it reminded me of a chocolate flan with some cookies.  I'm not a big chocolate fan but I really liked this dessert.  It was smooth and creamy and not too sweet.\n\nBesides my disappointment with my own entree, I loved everything else at Mesa Grill. The food took awhile to come out (I think they were waiting for all the dishes to be finished soo it can be served to all of us at the same time) but the service was good and Mesa Grill has a very nice atmosphere.

Our server's name was James, while he was very attentive, I felt he was kind of pushy at times. I asked the size of one of the appetizers and he told me an \"ounce\" I explained I wasn't sure how much food that was, and he seemed frustrated, and kept pushing for me to get a seafood entree if I hadn't come with a large appetite. I explained I wasn't too hungry, and eventually he suggested the shrimp tamale appetizer. Great suggestion, it was just the right amount of food.\n\nI tried the stake as well, and thought it was great, but no dish really impressed me... \n\nAnother nice gesture from the servers was them offering to walk us into Pure, but we had a table booked so it wasn't necessary.\n\nI might try this place again in the future.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "First of all, I have to say I probably am not being that fair in my restaurant rating, because Bobby Flay kind of seems like a jackass to me.\n\nOk, setting aside my prejudice against him as much as I can, I would say my meal was decent.

At first, I was really turned off by the \"tex-mex\" concept and even the name \"Mesa Grill\" didn't sound too appetizing, but we took a risk... and Bobby delivered.  We came here for my husband's 27th birthday and he had a wonderful time.\n\nSERVICE: \n5 Solid Stars!  The hostesses sat our party right away even though not everyone was there.  We were immediately served water and asked if we wanted any cocktails.  I really loved our waiter.  He wasn't just polite and attentive, but he was also engaging us in wonderful conversation throughout our meal.  He talked to us about how long he had been working there, and what Bobby's like... and he knew the menu like the back of his hand.  It was like having a new friend dine with us throughout the duration of our meal.  I wish I caught his name so I can give him props!\n\nFOOD:\nBread Basket - 2 stars.  They start you off with a variety of breads.  There was a jalapeno one, another one with some blue corn in it, and a third one that I can't recall.  All were very unique, but unfortunately, I wasn't a fan.  I didn't think the bread was very soft or moist, and the flavors didn't do it for me.  Kudos for thinking outside the box though.  The butter also wasn't the soft, spreadable kind.\n\nBlue Corn Pancake - 5 stars.  This appetizer came highly recommended by our server.  There was barbecued duck inside pancake (like a glorified taco), and a habanero chili star-anise sauce drizzled all over it.  The flavors all worked so well together to deliver an explosion of flavors in my mouth.\n\nSpanish Chorizo Quesadilla - 4 stars.  This was larger than expected!  It is pretty filling and could easily be substituted for a meal as a filler.  Or you can split this between 2-3 people and share it as an appetizer.  It's a pretty heavy dish and hard to eat too much of.  There's a large fried egg on top of a tortilla.  Embedded in the tortilla is smoked tomato salsa, grilled green onion, and crispy artichokes.  \n\nFor our entree, my husband and I shared the New Mexican Spice-Rubbed Pork Tenderloin even though I was realllly eyeing the 22 ounce bone-in Ribeye.  The waiter said the pork tenderloin was their signature dish so that's why we ordered it even though I'm not a huge fan of pork.  It wasn't until the dish arrived that we were convinced we had made the right choice!!  WOW, that was one tender, delicious, savory, melt-in-your-mouth piece of meat.  The spice rub added a bit of heat, and I can easily say this is the best piece of pork I've ever been served.  It came with a side of the most amazing tamale.  I can't even begin to describe how good it was.  You just have to try it.  5 Stars for this entire dish!!!\n\nI sampled some of the other dishes from my friends, but the pork dish was the definite standout.  My friend ordered the lamb chops, but they tasted a bit gamey and weren't as tender as they could've been.  The pan seared Halibut was tender and flaky paired with a lovely curry spice reduction.  I'd give both these dishes 4 stars.  \n\nAll in all a wonderful experience.

I've had really tender roast veal at Pines of Rome (Pines of Rome on Yelp) where I didn't need to cut it with a knife; it just fell of the bone. The veal at Mesa Grill was a bit tough to cut up and eat and we could barely taste the maple in the horseradish-maple glaze. The wild rice tamale w/ sage butter was definitely tastier than the veal. Kind of disappointing being that the veal dish was $42 and we only enjoyed the tamale! The pork tenderloin was much better but not quite living up to the reviews we've read on Yelp (reviews). The spices seemed to overwhelm the pork and I struggled with rubbing off some of the ancho chile sauce which was liberally \"drizzled\" all over the pork tenderloin (it was also all over the blue corn pancake w/ duck). The saving grace of the meal was the delicious sweet potato tamale w/ pecan butter. That definitely helped balance the heavily spiced pork and it was all around yummy goodness!

This must mean they are so super packed and busy they cannot afford even one cancellation since that is one extra table they turned away. Hmmm, was that the case?? I showed up at 8:15 on the dizot. Hi Mr. Lovil, please have a seat while we prepare your table. Okay I said and I sat with my lovely wife, and waited and waited. It was about 8:45 when I was retrieved to sit. Funny thing was there were plenty of open tables and no one cared when I asked why it took so long. We were seated at a small two person table, okay makes sense we are a party of two. I don't care for the seating arrangement however that places you directly next to another couple trying to have a nice night out. Regardless let's start the service, after poring over the wine list I chose a nice white, eh, or not so nice.

It was interesting and different and very flavorful, I'd say get it. Also got the pork tenderloin and hacked chicken, again we thought they were excellent. The tamale that comes with the pork is excellent, the tomatillo tamale on the chicken was only so so. We ordered way too much in terms of getting 2 sides with our meal, the corn and the spinach.

Did you choose Mesa because of Mr. Flay?  Do you watch Bobby on the food network?\" he simpered as he held the menu upside down in front of us.  His appetizer recommendation was good though.  The Queso Fundido was yummy.  As were the ($16) margaritas.  I was surprised they were that expensive at lunch time; I could have gotten similar cocktails at many other restaurants for $9-$12.\n\nMy biggest complaint about Mesa, and the reason I only give it one star, is the seasoning.

It was cooked perfectly and melt-in-my-mouth tender, but it didn't taste like anything but chili powder.  I love lamb because it tastes good.  Why go against that?

He was moving slowly, perhaps dazed by the spices as I was.\n\nWe quickly flagged down a busser (who had been really attentive about our bread, drinks, and water - I think he was my favorite thing about the meal) who brought the plate, still with bug, to our waiter.

Then she went on to explain that in a kitchen their size, things like this are unavoidable.  I get it.  Produce gets bugs, my kitchen has a bug in it from time to time, but she shouldn't have admitted that.  The right thing to do is say I'm so sorry and leave it at that.\n\nFunny story, when she had come by and inquired about how we were enjoying the meal earlier, I said \"It's ok,\" which is about how I felt.

It's not often that I enjoy a meal I had on the strip, as most of the strip restaurants are overpriced, and serve average food with a celebrity name on it.  Bobby Flay created a great restaurant, and I think it's very telling of the chef that Bobby Flay is.  Many don't like his conceited attitude, but he makes great food and does it while running many restaurants.  \n\nThe decor is very unique, and is perfect for it's location.  It is located in the Caesar's Palace, right next to the sportsbook.  The restaurant is scattered with a mosaic of rusty, yet bright colors.  The colors represent the southwestern theme of the restaurant, with influences of South America. \n\nThe service at Mesa Grill is top notch.  When your water is even close to done, it will be full.  When your drink is almost gone, they will ask you if you want a new one.  The corkage fee is $35, which is a bit steep for a place like this, but it's not too bad considering it's Las Vegas.  The waiters always have great suggestions, and are very knowledgeable on the menu and the terms of Southwestern cuisine.  \n\nThere are several signature items on the menu that are must-order items.  One of them is the Blue Corn, Duck Pancake.  BBQ duck is shredded and put into a blue corn pancake, and is topped with Habanero-Star Anise sauce.  This is the best appetizer.  Another great appetizer is the \"Queso Fundido\", a cheese dip made with goat cheese that is easy for the whole table to eat, and is the best cheese dip I've ever had.  \n\nThe best entree I've had here, and their signature entree, is the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin.  The portion is pretty big, and the pork is cooked perfect every time I've had it.  It is served with a sweet-potato tamale, and a bourbon-ancho chile sauce.  I have had this 3 times, and every time it has been the best thing at the table.  \nThe other entree that I recommend is the Lamb Porterhouse Chops, served with Red Chile, Lime, and Rosemary.  If there was any dish that could be better than the Pork Tenderloin, it's the Lamb Porterhouse Chops.  Although, if you like fish, try the Spice Rubbed Tuna, which is also very good.  \nIf you want a steak, there are 3 steak options on the menu.  All of them are very good, but not as unique as the other menu items.  There is a chipotle-glazed Ribeye, Coffee-rubbed Filet Mignon, and a New York Strip Steak served w/ their house-made Steak Sauce.  If you are looking to sample signature Bobby Flay cuisine, do not get the steaks.  But if you are the person in the group who wanted to go to the steakhouse, this is not a bad second option for a great steak.  \n\nIn conclusion, do not let your opinion of Bobby Flay steer you away from eating at Mesa Grill.  You may not like the guy, but the cuisine he cooks is a full of bold, unique flavors, and combines those flavors perfectly to show you why Bobby Flay is so popular.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "i just love chef bobby flay...\nall that matters: great atmosphere, delicious spicy food, great presentation, had an awesome time and great service, does not cost an arm and a leg.... cant beat that! \nAND its bobby flay!\ni had the blue corn pancake, spiced rubbed pork tenderloin, stuffed releno....\njust try it!", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "This is the third time I've eaten here and it was as good as always.

It was also paired with arugula, which was so delicious.  Another thing to mention, the bread that Mesa Grill gave before the meal was very unique.

The menu isn't quite as big as I was expecting, so we were able to narrow it down to 3 things, with pictures attached.  Ranked in order, they were:\n-scallop salad.  Micro greens, 3 scallops with a slightly spicy dry rub, and balsamic vinegar-like dressing.  Scallops were perfectly cooked and definitely the highlight of the dinner.\n-lobster.  It's cooked and taken out of the shell, so it's easy to eat and therefore you're not creating a mess in a fancy Las Vegas restaurant.  Mrs. C states that the sauce tastes like reduced bisque, and quite delicious.\n-pork tenderloin + twice baked potato.  The 3 pieces of pork tenderloin had a spicy dry rub, and then are nicely plated with 2 more sauces.  I have a pretty good tolerance for spicy food, but this was a tad too spicy for me.  The twice baked potato was good, but I should have gotten it without the horseradish.  Our server, to her credit, told us that the horseradish is mixed in, but not spicy.  She was right and it wasn't spicy, but knowing what I know now, I would have skipped the horseradish part of it.\n\nThis is a good meal, and there's no question that there is a lot of attention to detail to the food and our service was quite good.  I just think that for the money spent, this is an average value, and that's why I marked down 1 star.  Our dinner the day before at Sedona Lounge was only half the cost per person, and I was much happier.

The restaurant was a mad house which was ok as we knew it was going to be lively and it's literally right in the middle of a casino. We took a seat in the bar and were immediately struck by how unkempt the actual bar was. There was a 2009 best cocktail recipe book stuck on one of the shelves and a bottle of jug wine sitting next to it. I asked for a glass of sparkling wine or champagne and was given a mini bottle that tasted so terrible I had to send it back and get a margarita (which was delicious). We were seated shortly thereafter and our waiter was great - really on top of things and enthusiastic about waiting on us. We ordered a few more drinks (S getting one that was bubblegum pink so he made me switch with him) but were saddened by how awful the wine list was. There were no California wines which would have matched up perfectly to the Tex Mex style of food at Mesa Grill nor were there any great wines to try - it was as if the wine list was a complete afterthought. We persevered and placed our order - to start we ordered the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido and the Salmon and Tuna Tartars.

For our main courses, I ordered the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin and S had the Southwestern Spiced Duck Breast.

Lots of glass, light woods, and metal. The bar is off to the side as you enter and has a warm and inviting look about it. Of course you have Bobby Flay swag for sale right in your face as you approach the hostess stand. I get why it's there, but it upped the tacky level more than I'd usually like (even in Vegas). There were a fair number of people waiting, but we had reservations (party of 7) and our wait was less than 10 minutes.\n\nOur server was fairly prompt to the table to take appetizer orders, but I had to tell him we needed a drink menu and the wine list first (sorry, this is something that should be noticed by a server). The wine list was decent, but nothing exceptional. Prices ranged from 2.0x - 3.0x retail. We opted to do two bottles: one was a Joel Gott Zinfandel and the other was a central coast Syrah that carries the restaurant's private label. Both were about $60 each. The Zin was lovely, with a deep color, soft tannins, and all the mouthfeel you'd expect from a nice zinfandel. The syrah had nice flavor, but was a tad tight on its own. I figured it would shine with some of the meat dishes and it did pair very well with the entrees.\n\nNoise levels in the dining area were pretty loud, but it was also a Friday night in Vegas and the place was busy. As for the service after we ordered, well it can be summed up with one word: s-l-o-w. Our apps took a while to appear and the entrees took even longer after that. Close to 30 mins between app plates being removed and entree plates being brought. The server really wasn't checking in very often either and was pretty much invisible after our entrees came.\n\nThe menu is all about showcasing Bobby's flair for all things southwestern and you won't find much that doesn't have at least some corn, chile, salsa, and/or spice. Appetizers were all in the $10 - 16 range and entrees started at about $30 with most meat dishes over $40. Sides are separate (of course) and they're $8 a pop. We ordered a lot of food for seven people, so I will only get into the highlights and lowlights of the dinner:\n\nMenu Highlights\n\n    * Spanish Chorizo Quesadilla - This was by far the best thing on the appetizer menu (and arguably on the whole menu). It is served up with grilled green onions, artichokes and a smoky salsa. A fried egg adorns the top of the totrilla to complete the package. This was awesome. The flavors all work together and the chorizo had nice bite without overpowering the dish.\n    * Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon - This was a nice sized filet, cooked perfectly to the requested medium rare. It came with a mushroom reduction sauced spiked with ancho chile. It was very tasty and the coffee rub added a nice nuance to the dish. The person eating it was kind enough to share some of it with us. I knew by the size of the smile on his face that it was a winner before I even tried any of it.\n    * Roasted Corn - Yes, this is a side dish, but it ranks as one of the better options on the menu. The corn kernels were crisp-tender and then tossed with cactus & lime. Some cotija cheese is sprinkled on top for good measure, too. Very tasty and worth the $8 for a bowl. \n\nMenu Lowlights\n\n    * Tiger Shrimp & Roasted Garlic Tamale - I figured this dish was a no-brainer in this restaurant, maybe that's why it was such a huge disappointment. The shrimp were a nice size, but overcooked and the textured of the tamale itself seemed way too dry. This went mostly uneaten. \n    * Green Chile Ciopinno - Flay is known for award winning ciopinno, but let's say that this was not the finest example. Most of the seafood was overcooked, which was such a downer because the green chile broth was amazing (I'd order a bowl of the broth by itself if I could).\n    * Salmon with Ancho-Honey Glaze - This was a nice sized piece of salmon and, as opposed to the other seafood dishes, it was cooked perfectly. It was served with a spicy black bean sauce and a jalapeno crema. It all sounded like it would go well together, but it really amounted to just too much going on. On top of that, it was extremely salty. It all added up to a dish I wanted to forget about after a few bites. \n\nFinal Take \n\nMesa Grill was kind of a mixed bag for us. It did some things really well, but there were a lot of things that were 'meh', too. When you're talking about a place that was $100+ per person, I expect a bit more in the food and service department. If I had to do it over, I'd probably stick with having a drink and an app at the bar, then go get dinner elsewhere. My apologies to Bobby, but this is one throwdown that he lost because this foodie feels you can do far better on the Strip at this price point.\n\nOverall Grade = C+ (Average)\n\nThe EV Foodie", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Dropped in for dinner one night to try it.

We had a 7:45 reservation and if you miss your reservation you are charged a 50 dollar per person cancellation fee. I did not want to take that risk. We checked in for our reservations and were asked to wait near the bar. Dan and I ordered some semi custom margaritas. The margaritas were awesome.. I mean tasty and strong. I opted to get the basic margarita and add a shot of grand mariner to give it a little citrus kick. Dan went with the Margarita with Patron. We got our drinks and before we took our first sip, our table was ready. Our server was friendly but he looked a little preoccupied. Like I said earlier.. there was this woman dining alone who was acting peculiar. The EMT was called, but she was nutty not sick.

For dinner, I went with the NEW MEXICAN SPICE RUBBED PORK TENDERLOIN and I swear I saw food god that day. It was prepared to perfection and the Bourbon - Ancho Chile Sauce was so sweet yet spicy.

(we had tried for dinner the previous night, but they were totally booked).  We started with a margarita, which was absolutely delicious (much more flavorful than anything you get sitting in a casino, of course).  For food, we got the cremini mushroom quesadilla (omg, amazing), the ancho chili salmon (yummy, great sear on the fish, but not spicy enough for us) and the shrimp tacos (tasty shrimp, but see below for my thoughts on the 'salsas')\n\nThe things that stuck out were the following:\nThe plating was beeeeaaaauuutiful. Everything looked a lot better than it tasted...\nThe mango habanero 'salsa' that accompanied the tacos was awful. It looked and tasted like baby food. Not nearly enough habanero...or really anything other than mango. I really should have tasted it before putting it in my taco because it really ruined it. Ick. \nWe asked our waiter for something spicy to eat with the fish and he brought us a delicious chipotle sauce. I wanted to take home a bottle of it.\n\nAll in all, we had a pleasant meal here.

But, I was not disappointed.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I tried really hard to like it, but given my expectations, I'd have to say I'm sorely disappointed.\n\nNot to say the stuff wasn't tasty, because it was. But that's all it really was. It was not a religious experience or anything that I haven't had before. It was decent, unadventurous food at prices that flabbergasted me. If I'm paying for a name, I expect a distinctive meal and unfortunately I didn't get it on my visit.\n\nI liked the ambiance of the restaurant, though of course since it's in Vegas you get the occasional rowdy cheer from the betting area. Servers were fine but didn't seem as professional as I would have liked for dinner service in that they did a poor job of blending into the surroundings and made some odd seating decisions (shoved me and my friend into the back of the restaurant when there weren't that many guests at the time). Speaking of that the lighting in the very back of the restaurant is a bit underwhelming, though for the rest of the restaurant I felt it was just fine. The seating in the back was a bit closer than I would like, as people that were seated next to us during the course of the meal were far too close (leaning over in any way and there would be contact) and I could easily listen in on other conversations which I don't think is appropriate for the type of restaurant it is.\n\nSo onto the food:\n\nBread basket consisted of muffins, a jalapeno bread, and a raisin bread. The raisin bread had a vaguely fermented scent and was slightly soggy, so I wasn't quite sure what was up with that. The muffin was quite crumbly and didn't have much distinct flavor, which would be a theme for the rest of the night, as the jalapeno bread also lacked any semblance of heat to perk up my tastebuds. The bread basket was really nothing to write home about.\n\nI started off with the Blue Corn Pancake with BBQ duck. Flavors were balanced well, if a bit reserved. The sauces were straightforward and somewhat banal. BBQ duck was sweet and the meat flaky, though I felt that the duck really lacked the sort of gameiness and distinctive flavor I associate with duck. If not for the texture and mouth feel someone could have told me it was some other mystery meat and I probably wouldn't have made much of a fuss. The blue corn tortilla was what you would expect, though a bit thicker than I would have liked. The microgreens that topped the appetizer were really unnecessary and contributed nothing to the dish and I wonder if maybe there was another decorative herb that would have had some impact on the flavors rather than just the appearance of the plate. All in all a fairly well-decorated plate but average tasting dish. Portion was extremely lacking.\n\nSince it was the holidays, my server informed me they were serving an exclusive dish consisting of pork chop with sweet potato and apple. I was intrigued and opted out of my original entree choice. The plate itself was decorated nicely and had a really homey, \"straight from grandma's house\" feel to it which I liked.  I wasn't sure if I made the right decision or not by choosing this, but the pork chop dish was tame at best. My server did inform me that there wouldn't be as much spice as the pork tenderloin dish they serve, but the double-cut pork chop itself didn't even have a strong porky flavor. The meat was drier than I would have liked. If they did any other sort of marinade or preparation for the meat, I couldn't taste it. The ancho-chile sauce it was paired with was a good, but again, very reserved match-- the dish had almost non-existent heat. I can't call anything on the dish bland and they were seasoned fairly well, it's just that nothing was particularly distinctive or elevated the ingredients. The sweet potatoes were sliced and served simply as is-- I'm guessing they were sauteed in a flavored butter of some sort, as it was still very firm and didn't taste exactly like you would expect sweet potato to taste like. I had been expecting a more thorough preparation or at least mashed sweet potato to fit a holiday theme, so I was a bit surprised to see how it was served-- but surprisingly the flavor was very unique, almost nutty. The roasted apple, stuffed with walnuts and cinnamon, was probably the star of the night and tasted great-- tart, fragrant, and not particularly sugary at all. A wonderful holiday treat. The portions on the dish were all well-sized, balanced, and appropriate.\n\nSo while Mesa Grill is probably worth another visit on my part, from what I could tell the exorbitant prices didn't justify what was served. I don't doubt they could have had an off day, but I was hoping the dishes would really pack significant flavor and everything was just a small blip on my tastebuds. Given Flay's reputation for stronger, bolder flavors, I expected more.

This is a fantastic change while keeping the integrity of so many familiar ingredients.\n\nMy favorite appetizers are a tie between the goat cheese queso fondidu and the the blue corn pancake with BBQed duck. Now, many years ago the queso fondidu used to be melted goat cheese with a poblano salsa which I actually preferred over the rajas they serve with it now. That's just my personal preference though, but I still really like it a lot. With the blue corn pancake I've had inconsistencies with the amount of duck, and how they've plated it. Mixed in --- or sliced on top --- I'm assuming maybe it was just the quality of the duck, or from where they got the meat from. Breasts slice nicely, so that goes on top. Thigh not so much, so that get mixed in? Ok. Still good. I love duck in any way, so no complaints on my end taste-wise.\n\nFrom the most current menu, I'd have to say the pan roasted venison is my favorite and a close second would be the New Mexico spiced pork tenderloi. I've never ordered the 16 spice chicken however I've had it a couple of times over the years from picking off of other people's plates and the chicken has always been consistently good and never dry. \n\nThere used to be a spiced steak on the menu a long time ago and I wish they'd bring that back. :( The last two times I haven't ordered a steak so I don't know if any of the new steaks even compare.

We were both impressed by their staff's cordial and professional service.

Each bite has a familiar spice kick.\n\nThen, we ordered the BBQ Lamb Cobb Salad and the Eggs + Aged Strip Loin Tortilla. The cobb salad and lamb were divine! I loved the buttermilk dressing, so good!  The tortilla dish was on the mediocre side and made me wish I ordered the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash (which has been on the menu for the last 8? years) However, I was mainly looking for a steak for lunch so it satisfied for cravings.

I had visited Mesa grill in October of last year and really enjoyed it. So we chose it again for our after rewedding brunch, Saturday the 15th of January. We wanted something special since we had 9 friends joining us. So I made reservations here. I raved and raved about the food and everyone was so excited to be eating there. Let's start with the reservations. I called and made the reservations about a month in advance since I knew we were going to have a large party. The restaurant wanted my credit card and I was told that there would be a $50.00 charge to my credit card for anyone who didn't show. I didn't like that idea but I really wanted a special meal for everyone so I went ahead with it. \n\nI ordered a wedding cake from a bakery in New Orleans as my wedding cake (we are all from Louisiana) and let them know I would be bringing it with me. I was told that would be fine. \n\nSo we all get there early after the rewedding and we were seated fairly quickly considering we were early. \n\nThe service started off. It wasn't fantastic like you would expect from Mesa Grill but we had a large party and I was willing to overlook it. \n\nNo one raved about the food. it was just mediocre. The spicy chicken and sweet potato has had very little chicken. It should have been a dessert because it was way too sweet. \n\nThe Eggs and Aged Strip loin would have been good if it had been served warm. \n\nThere were even complaints about the hamburger being just so-so. I will say the french fries were amazing. \n\nWhile we are eating the hostess came over to let us know that there would be a $6.00 charge per slice per person for my king cake. Keep in mind that this is the first time I had heard of this. Oh but it would come with a scoop of ice cream. So we said thanks but no thanks. Just bring it to us and we would slice. No deal if they brought that cake to our table and we ate it. It would cost us 54.00$$$$ So we didn't get to eat our wedding cake. \n\nThen comes the bill. Of course we didn't expect separate checks. But what they would do is let us pay for 4 ways. In other words each couple would just pay what they owed. If you are a Total rewards member you can use your points to pay your bill. SO the waiter takes every ones form of payment and comes back with my Total rewards card and tells me I don't have enough points on my card. I knew I had more than enough and told him as he walked away and NEVER came back. I finally flagged down the hostess after about 15 minutes and told her what happened. She called Total Rewards and they confirmed what I told her and everything was taken care of. The waiter got his 18% mandatory tip and he was through with us. \n\nI'm very sad that I picked Mesa grill out of all the places I could have picked in Vegas for my rewedding brunch and was treated this way in front of all my friends who flew out there for this occasion. Shame..I guess I'm used to better food and service being from Louisiana.

I made a reservation a month ahead. The interesting part is that Mesa Grill required the customers to provide their credit card numbers.

I think if people really want to go, they would be willing to go through the trouble.\n\nI love the ceiling with the flaming painting. Nothing would match better with Bobby Flay's cooking style, chili peppers and spices. Before going to Mesa Grill, I was very worried that I couldn't get anything to eat, because I don't eat spicy food at all. When we got there, I talked to the server. He said that most of Bobby's food is not that spicy, and the chili add flavors. He gave a couple of suggestions, and I went with the WILD STRIPED BASS. My husband got the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. And, we shared BLUE CORN PANCAKE for appetizer.\n\nThe BLUE CORN PANCAKE is served with shredded pieces of duck. The first bite definitely reminded me of the Chinese Peking duck. The duck was good and juicy. Even though there was Habanero (one of the most intense chili pepper in the world), it wasn't spicy at all. It was very flavorful. My husband loved it! His pork tenderloin was placed nicely on the plate. The rubbed was definitely spicy. Bryan said it was a bit spicy for him, but it was edible. The side SWEET POTATO TAMALE was sweet and delicious. It was a perfect balance with the spicy pork. My WILD STRIPED BASS was crispy on the outside, and cooked perfect on the inside. My favorite was the Piquillo Pepper Clam Chowder under the bass. It was packed with different layers of flavors, and it was not spicy! Fantastic!\n\nThe meal was great. For the two of us, our check was about $120. The food was very good.

The decor is contemporary but not minimalist; it is upscale but approachable and warm (warm browns and reds throughout the dining area that give it an upscale Southwestern feel).  The high ceilings really open up the room; the seating is comfortable and nice.  Good design throughout the restaurant with an open kitchen and contemporary decoration that is subtle.\n\nThe assortment of complimentary bread was just okay though the most interesting look piece (a corn bread muffin with blue corn and jalapenos) was probably my least favorite of the batch.\n\nI started with the crispy quail, which came with a sauce of hot mustard, Ancho chile and Seitz Family Farm Honey.  The quail was breaded and fried, which was a risk because of the little bit of meat that comes with quail.  This one was good though.  The meat was moist and flavorful while the breading was crisp and not greasy (like good fried chicken).\n\nThe sauce was good and was bold in flavor--kind of a mix of a spicy southwestern sauce and a sweet BBQ sauce.  The sauce was not too overpowering and was a good compliment for the fried quail.  I wish they would have added some sides or garnishes to lighten the dish up though.\n\nI went with the veal chop and it was a generous portion.  The veal itself was great.  The outside sear was very good and the meat was juicy and moist, which can be hard to do because veal is so lean.  They used a good piece of meat here as well.\n\nThe sauce was a mix of horseradish and maple glaze.  Like the quail sauce, there was a bold mix of both spicy and sweet flavors here.  The sauce had a little too much heat though because it kind of overwhelmed my palate.  It was one of those spicy dishes where after several bites, you kind of just taste the burn and have a hard time getting the most out of the other flavors.\n\nThe veal chop came with a wild rice tamale.  I am not that familiar with tamales so I cannot speak to how well this one would stack up with others.  The wild rice flavor and texture really came across here (pretty good portion of wild rice).  The tamale itself had a strong corn flavor and was sweet and moist enough (not dry).\n\nThe waiter was very professional and knowledgeable about the menu.  Service was good--food came out at a good pace and the staff was attentive.\n\nPricing was high, but pricing is high at most Las Vegas restaurants.  The food at Mesa Grill was in a similar price range as Eiffel Tower Restaurant (Paris) and the food here was significantly better.  My veal chop here was actually less than what I paid at Spago in Beverly Hills--I thought Mesa Grill did a much better job cooking the meat to the appropriate temperature though I liked the accompanying sauce and sides more at Spago.\n\nI liked Mesa Grill and would return.  My friend (who is a Bobby Flay fan) was a little disappointed with this one so some dishes may stand out more than others.  The flavors here were quite bold (with strong mixes of sweet, savory and spicy on several dishes) so if you find a lot of fine dining places to be bland or too mild, this might be the one for you.  I do not have that much experience with Las Vegas restaurants, but I would say Mesa Grill would be one of the better ones I've tried.\n\nValet parking is complimentary.

The tamale was top notch, and the Flay-concocted Corn-Cilantro Sauce will pair up nicely with other seafood and poultry dishes.  \n\n\nFor my entree, I selected Bobby Flay's signature dish \"New Mexican Spiced Rubbed Pork Tenderloin, Bourbon-Ancho Chile Sauce + Sweet Potato Tamale with Crushed Pecan Butter\".

I mean, he must be a decent guy to get himself on so many spots on the Food Network, right?  If it is just an act though, it works; his brash personality actually made me want to try his cooking even more, just so I could see if he's as good as his reputation suggests.  And being that the MESA in NY was his first restaurant, my friends and I figured this would the perfect chance to check out his cooking.  \n\nUnfortunately, we couldn't squeeze MESA in for dinner, so we had to settle for fitting it in for brunch instead.  When our party of ten checked in with the hostess, we were seated promptly, where the wait staff was quick to start serving our table.  Our waiter was helpful with menu suggestions, and was pretty good at describing and explaining the different components of each plate.  In fact, when it was all said and done, I ended up going with one of his suggestions - the Scrambled Eggs Chilaquiles along with the Rough Cut Tuna Nachos that a few of my friends wanted to split.\n\n- The Rough Cut Tuna Nachos - served with a mango & habanero hot sauce and avocado crema...terrific.  The tuna is similar to Hawaiian poke, but with Southwestern flavors instead.  In a way, with the crema, it's reminiscent of a guacamole salsa, but better.  Much better.  Too bad there aren't any places around here that serve it the same way.\n\n- Scrambled Eggs Chilaquiles - served with a roasted tomatillo sauce, white cheddar cheese, and creme fraiche.  Presentation wise, all of the colors on the plate really made it stand out (blue corn tortilla, orange sauce, white cheddar, green seasoning), but the execution is what really made the dish.  With three layers of crispy tortilla, it had a nice crunch, which worked well with the richness.  The combination of flavors were fantastic.  If anything, I wish there was more of a kick with the sauce, but it tasted great as is.\n\nIn addition, I also got a chance to try my friend's Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash, but I thought my entree was better.

I'm already a fan of Bobby Flay who seems to be on everything on Food Network nowadays. The stars and reviews built up my excitement...and then I heard from friends of friends that it sucked. I was a little scared that it really would suck and I'd curse Bobby Flay with every ounce of my being (like when I tried to come here on my last trip and they closed early to redo the floors).\n\nBetter half and I arrived here for brunch over Memorial Day weekend. We had our reservations about how much I'd like the place seeing as how I die if I lick a hot cheeto. Lots of things say spicy this...spicy that..spicy everything. In my head, I tell myself to toughen up and just try it...then I wimped out and went with a blue corn waffle. I ordered a cactus pear iced tea along with it since I was a bit curious. Boyfriend ordered spicy scrambled eggs sans goat cheese. The waiter gave him a bit of grief over it..saying he would check with the chef if that was allowed..asking if he didn't like it or if he was allergic...yada yada. \n\nOur plates came out and the waffle is the size of my face. Actually, bigger. It comes with vanilla creme fraiche and blackberry bourbon syrup. I'm not a fan of blackberries but this was divine! All the flavors melded together wonderfully. It wasn't overly sweet and the waffle had a distinct flavor. I tried (and failed) to finish the whole thing but only ate 3/4s of it. They prepared the eggs to bf's liking, without cheese, and he said it was delicious! I looked over at his plate and it was quite green from the onions and pleeenty of jalapeno. I didn't even attempt a bite. The tea was quite refreshing. It had a light flavor that contrasts how bitter tea can get. No need for sweetener here.\n\nOverall a pleasant experience.

I really didn't care too much for the tuna steak..it had way too many peppercorns. The bf had the grouper & didn't really care much for it either. I think the only thing I liked was the margarita I ordered. So yea when I think of Mesa grill, I think of a bourgeosie Chili's or Chevy's where you're likely to find mango chutney or ancho chile sauce on the menu & where you can expect to spend over $100 on sub par Tex Mex food.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 5, "useful": 3, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "Bobby Flay certainly has grilling down.

As in, it was kind of bland.

My opinion of the place went up significantly. Not because of the snapper, but because I had a bite out of my sister's rib eye!!! BOY OH BOY! It was like melted gold on my tongue. This piece of cow melted in my mouth and slithered its own way all the way down my tummy. There it lay so happily until digestion took its course and brought it out to reality. \n\nMy last experience here was just short of two nights ago. I went with my Human Garbage Disposal. He was very excited to try Mesa Grill because he is a fan of Bobby Flay and I was enthusing about the infamous melt in your mouth rib eye. I ordered another fish- the grouper. Our food arrived, I looked at the huge rib-eye enviously and looked at my petite grouper. Whatever right? As soon as I took a bite out of the grouper, I pretty much dismissed all theatrics of the rib-eye and deemed the grouper the best dish I could ask for from Mesa Grill. So flavorful, so colorful, so tasty! And maybe it was my imagination, but the rib eye that I stole a bite from did not melt in my mouth. Dear grouper fish, never become extinct.

I ordered the tuna steak.  I ordered it rare and it came out medium well, there was a light pink center with canned tuna tasting outer layer.  Promptly sent back.  They redid and it was OK but it was obvious the grill master did not have the grill high enough for sufficient crisping of the outer layer. We ordered some corn tamales and corn pudding.  The tamale went mostly uneaten after the first bite and the corn pudding was salty.  We were so disappointed we decided to head elsewhere for dessert.

You can have great steak anywhere I wanted signature stuff. \n\nWell as I mentioned earlier we piggies made the mistake of eating all the bread and when we saw the entrees were limited to like 6 choices other than the 3 sizes of steak we decided to order two apps each and try a bunch of different things. We asked the waiter a whole bunch of questions and let him steer us in the right direction. We ended up getting the two different quesadillas (chicken and black bean and the wild mushroom one) but we both got our own tiger shrimp and garlic tamale. We weren't in the sharing mood. \n\nBig mistake! It was soooo much food! Four appetizers for two ppl and two drinks was more than enough food, plus the bread basket...we couldnt even consider dessert (which makes me sad :( i love dessert but i was about to explode). \n\nThe quesadillas weren't huge but they were a good portion I couldnt finish a whole mushroom one b/c it was very rich (cheesy) but sooo freaking good with the mix of cheeses fontina  I think and cotija and this basil/cilantro green chili concoction over the whole thing AND AND a big ass fried egg with a slightly runny yolk that tied the whole thing together. Wow.  Amazing.  My bf's chicken one was really good too but very different less rich and had a great chipotle chili sauce (very mild). I couldnt decide which I liked better though I think you could get through more of the chicken/black bean one b/c it wasn't as rich. \n\nThe shrimp tamale.....was.....like my aunt's if she were to make tamales out of shrimp. Yes that means it tastes like food my family could make but that's a good thing. And I'm only referring to the corn meal part of the tamale. It was flavored beautifully not overly lard-y which always happens at southwest places eww. But the shrimp sauce that was 5 star chef stuff all the way. Again after attempting to tackle the entire quesadilla (got through 3/4!) eating the whole tamale was not gonna happen but I made a valiant effort. \n\nIn the end we were left very satisfied, aka full and with 4 apps and two cactus (prickly pear) margaritas plus tax and tip we paid about 115....ya it was a special dinner and it was Bobby Flay's place...otherwise ya 4 apps..100 bucks!...ok well 25 of it is two drink but still! you get the point. \n\nBut you gotta try this place!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "My last meal on earth will be the Rib eye!\n\nI was a bit tired of Bobby Flay and had lost passion for his food and shows and I guess seeing him on the tele all the time is a bit overwhelming.

So getting there about 30 minutes late for our 8:30 dinner reservation, we had to wait about 5 minutes till our party was complete.   Right then and there they led us to our table and offered for drinks on the spot.   Hello tequila!   Yes, they have a great selection and the margaritas are just golden.   Mixed sweet and it's got the kick.   Our waiter introduced himself and informed us about the wine list. He even pointed out some of the specific details of the tequila list and explained some of the items on the menu. The bread basket was good, but I was mostly impressed with the customer service and the interior.   We skipped the appetizer and decided to go for the entree since we had to catch up with our schedule for the club.   I opted for the Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops.   This is where BF's talent in his signature sauces come in.   Simple presentation, just grilled with a side of Tamale and the meat in the center.   The flavors come together and heaven came down to earth.   It was a balance of meatiness, salt, sweet, spice, and a tang of goodness. It looked like I can finish the plate, but wow was I wrong.   That portion was a lot for one person to conquer.   Next time I'll try the seafood. \n\nI'll be back Mesa, I'll make sure to leave my hotel an hour before considering the strip traffic and the parking.   There are three places to valet park and the best one is all the way in the back closest to the restaurant.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I have been wanting to go to Mesa Grill for years but never pulled the trigger.

The filet was great but some of the sides were not served with the meal and were brought as an after thought. \n\nIt was kind of strange when I made reservations I was asked if it was a special occasion and I replied it was our anniversary.  The person on the phone said \"we like to do something special on special occasions\" so I'm thinking \"cool, free dessert\".  Well, the best we can figure the \"something special\" is your waiter saying \"Happy Anniversary\".

People love their shows, their recipes and even their TV personality, so the excellence of their restaurant and food are normally blown way out of proportion. However, with Mesa Grill, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I was wrong in thinking the food was going to be simply mediocre and left more than satisfied with the 1000+ calories I had just happily consumed.\n\nWhen I sat down I immediately told the server that I was gluten-free. Without flinching, he told me that most of the food is gluten-free, but if not, they can substitute the sides, etc, so I won't become ill. This was most relieving since 1/2 the restaurants I have gone to in Vegas don't know what gluten-free means, so this was a great start to the meal.\n\nAfter watching the show \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate: Vegas,\" I had to come and try the tiger shrimp tamale. I asked the server if it was gluten-free and he said absolutely. My fiance told him to definitely get a start on that tamale with a massive smile on his face and the server obliged. However, before he left he told us about the specials and showed how real restaurants should be training their staff. Very professional. Very friendly. Very fantastic.\n\nOh the Tiger Shrimp. I could bathe in the sauce. I envisioned myself swimming in it last night. I could put it on everything and even though my heart would scream each day, it would be worth the Lipitor. Great flavors, fresh, succulent shrimp and just a small amount of heat. If you are not a fan of garlic, stay away, because unlike the heat, there was a plentiful amount of garlic to keep any creepy Twilight vampire away for years.\n\nI cannot say very much about the chile relleno my fiance ate because 1. It was not gluten-free, but most importantly, 2. It was gone in ten minutes. The ONLY reason it took him that long to eat the chile was because we had just eaten a massive corn tamale and split a bottle of wine. Also, once in a while we try to act like we're classy and not inhale our food. All I know is that seeing the cheese slowly pouring out of the chile when he broke the shell reminded me why I love cheese and why it is so dang good.\n\nI ordered the spicy chicken. When you place the words, spicy, chicken and hollandaise sauce all in the same sentence I will pounce on whatever it is IMMEDIATELY. The fact that I was in a breakfast mood was only boosted by the perfectly poached egg on top. Texture city and oh the flavors! Even though I wish it was actually spicy (please note that I am Korean and burn my tastebuds off every other day with chili paste), it was really perfect. First, I picked off a couple pieces of the chicken and then just broke into that poached egg and let it smother the spicy chicken in its happiness. Then I would roll a forkful around in the green hollandaise and all cravings, protein, brunch and fatty goodness were satisfied in one quick bite. It took me a long time to eat it because I was still full from the tamale, but you can't take a poached egg as a leftover while walking around in 100 degree weather. I was forced to eat it all. For shame.\n\nYou should go here. Great service, the food is creative, colorful and absolutely solid.

The hosts were friendly. The restaurant itself is beautiful! We were at the table maybe two minutes before our server (the amazing Encina) came over with our menus and a mouth-watering description of the night's specials. We were taken aback by the amazing service and care, not only because Encina and the rest of the staff care about their food and their customers but also because Lillie's Noodle House and Grotto Ristorante at the Golden nugget were such a shit-show with their horrific excuses for service (see those reviews for why).\n\nShe gave us a few minutes to peruse the drink menu and came back with waters before taking our order. We couldn't resist asking for her favorite appetizers and ended up getting two AMAZING appetizers:\n-Roasted Corn Soup: the soup itself is light and sweet, a delicious puree of sweet corn.  It came out warm and had a slight bit of heat that lingered in your mouth. It was perfectly seasoned and a great way to begin our meal.\n-Chicken and Black Bean Quesadilla: It's a great appetizer for four or two. The tortilla was crispy and had a little char to it. Inside, the cheese and meat mingled amazingly. On top, the cotija and quacamole beckoned us to the plate like Sirens.\n\nWe got our drinks and commented on how the meal was batting-a-thousand so far.\nWhite Peach Margarita (my friend and one of my brothers): the sweetest of the bunch. Tasty and light; great balance between the tequila and white peach flavors.\nCadillac Margarita (my other brother): I like to taste my alcohol when I'm drinking and a Caddy guarantees that I will. This was a great margarita!\nCactus Pear Margarita (my drink): I ordered this one because of the rave reviews on Yelp and it didn't disappoint. It wasn't too sweet and packed a nice punch. The flavor was great.\n\nEncina was back within ten minutes to take our orders. Here's what we got (and loved):\n-Mango and Spice Crusted Tuna: good God almighty this was good (for an agnostic guy to say this is saying something)!!! The tuna was cooked perfectly. The spicy sear on the outside was enough of a crunch to perfectly contrast the tender tuna. The mango glaze the accompanied the fish was sweet enough to enhance the fish without being too sweet or overpowering. The pine-nut cous cous was soft and delicious. The green and red peppercorn sauces on the plate were the perfect accent. The peppercorns were a soft burst of peppery goodness.\n-Sixteen Spice Chicken: although not the route I would have gone, this was really good. For those who want to play it safe. The chicken was tender and the sixteen spices were definitely a party in my mouth, but chicken just isn't adventurous for me. My brother loved it; we both agreed that the spiciness level was great.\n-Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon: The meat was incredibly tender and juicy. The rub on the outside could very well be the best thing ever put onto a piece of meat. The coffee shined through enough that you knew it was there, but didn't take over the dish. The mushroom-ancho chile sauce was the perfect sauce.\n-Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops: these were incredible!!! The spices were just right and the meat was tender. The garlic tamale was delicious as well.\n\nEncina checked on us throughout the meal and kept us laughing. Once we were done, she put down the drink menu and the desert menu and said, \"Now, I know you're not leaving without another drink and some desert!\" She knew us too well!!! Here's the grand finale:\n-Pomegranate martini (friend): Light on pomegranate taste. Tasted a little cough-syrupy. She was not impressed, but our tastebuds may have needed a nap after the amazing dinner we had.\n-Mesa Pisco Sour: very nice! The alcohol shone through without being too much.\n-Mango Buttermilk Upside Down Cake: not enough to share for more than two, but I was really the only one who wanted desert so it was perfect for everyone to have a taste. The cake was nice, light, and warm. The caramel rum sauce was fantastic and the mango ice cream was great.\n\nWe got to talking about how it was my birthday. At another table, I guess Encina heard us. She said, \"I wasn't eavesdropping or anything, but did I hear a birthday over here?\" They pointed to me and she replied, \"OK. Don't go anywhere\" and sprinted across the restaurant. She came back, told me to close my eyes as she lit a candle and placed it in a small ramekin of their homemade vanilla-bean whipped cream (best ever!). She told me to make a wish before I opened my eyes and said, \"From my heart, happy birthday.\" It was one of the nicest restaurant birthdays I've ever had.\n\nOverall, we couldn't have been happier with dropping close to $300 on a dinner for four. The food was amazing! The service was spectacular. Encina is incredibly sweet and takes care of you.

We opted to nab two sides instead of a second appetizer and decided on the roasted corn and the cornmeal-crusted chile relleno to go with our entrees. The corn could quite possibly be one of my favorite foods ever -- beyond delicious and seriously a MUST if you're ordering a side. The chile was great, though didn't quite have the same impact. Being a pescetarian, the tuna steak was a pretty natural entree selection for me and it couldn't have been a better choice. A surprisingly big portion and all-around amazing plate. I should say though that we had entirely too much food. We could have JUST had our entrees and I would have been satisfied. One app + two entrees for two people is probably enough unless you're particularly hungry.

It came on the blue side of rare throughout and burned to a crisp on the outside. The chipotle glaze was completely lost and instead it tasted like a briquette.

No cheese. Mt sister requested cream fraiche on the side... With a smirk from the waiter.\n\n3 others in our party ordered the Tuna Steak entree.

We were seated to our table, and our waiter came out to speed read us our menu and his recommendations.  I started with a bloody and when my wife stated that water was all she wanted, the waited ignored her and showed her the drink menu, gave more opinions of what he would have etc etc.  When she reiterated that all she wanted was water, he glared, yes folks, glared and walked away.  So our food came out real fast... too fast... As in yeah we had this made already and just warmed it up a touch.  I don't need my food made from scratch each and every time, I just don't want it to taste like it was made days ago and reheated.  So I had the  Mesa burger. Double cheddar cheese. Grilled Vidalia onion. Horseradish mustard.  Asked for medium rare/medium.  got medium well/well.  if you are going to ask me how I want it cooked you should try to adhere to that level of \"cookedness\" ;-)  The burger was lack luster from bun to burger to onion to my mouth.  Nothing about this burger was good aside from the horseradish mustard, which had a nice kick.  If I wanted a mediocre burger I would go to applebee's or something like that.  At least there I would not be let down with a bad tasting burger, I would expect it.  Tiger shrimp and roasted garlic corn tamale is what my wife had.  Oh course I ate some too, sharing is caring.  We agreed that the shrimp was overcooked.  I think that this dish would have been pretty good if the shrimp was not overcooked.  It surely had the potential.  The tamale was great, soft moist flavorful.  No wonder this dish has been on the menu since the opening of the restaurant. So overall this place was a let down.

My wife ordered the salmon this time, very moist and juicy, she loved it too.  For appetizer we ordered the shrimp tamale and duck pancake.  But was done very well and very tasty.  Mesa Grill food are always on the strong side, but you never feel food being too overpowering and I could definitely have more.  \n\nHowever, food aside, I have to say we were not as impressed about their staff services this time around.  On our first visit it was fabulous.  This time our server was very nice but not top notch by my book.  \n\nThe staff at the front though really left us some bad taste.  First of all, when we made reservation, my wife clearly said 7 people, 4 adults and 3 kids.  When we arrived and checked, they said no only 6 people.  Fine, things happen and I consider that innocent mistake.  But the staff didn't show any \"concern\" or \"eagerness\" to help fix the problem.\n\nEnding up my wife stood there for a few seconds and asked \"so is this going to be OK?\"  The male and female staff stood there, looked at each other, talked a bit, and said \"yeah it's fine\".  My wife then said \"OK, thanks.  We will be waiting outside because of the kids\".  Both staff did NOT even acknowledged her, not even looked at her once. \n\nSeriously?  To me it's very basic customer service to at least acknowledge your customers.  I don't even we were even asking for the unreasonable.  Mesa is not the most expensive restaurant out there but still on the high side, so I personally expect better services overall.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Holy Yum Batman!!! \nThis was the best dinner I had while in Vegas.\n\nOur visit was near x-mas, so I can't speak to the wait time since there wasn't one for us.

The appetizer and main course are on the regular menu.  Dessert is not listed on their website menu so this was a good sampler of the real thing at Mesa Grill.\n\nOn being seated, I was given the regular menu, a wine and cocktail menu, and the Restaurant Week menu.  My server, Rodil, was great with ordering and everything thereafter.  I ordered an iced tea and it was brought quickly followed by bread basket with a nice selection--two slices of jalape\u00f1o bread with a nice kick, a corn muffin, and two slices of raisin bread.  Accompanying the bread was softened butter.  I also tried the corn muffin.  It was good but a little dry.  The best thing about the muffin was the number of corn bits baked into it.  Still the jalape\u00f1o bread was my favorite.\n\nFor the first course, I ordered the blue corn pancake.  It was filled with duck and had a habanero chile-star anise sauce.  Rodil had alerted me that this wasn't spicy, but for a starter, I didn't care.\n\nThe second course was Flay's signature dish, New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with a bourbon-ancho chile sauce and a sweet potato tamal which had a round of crushed pecan butter placed into the sweet potato/corn mixture to add liquid.  The pork was tender and cooked perfectly.  The spices rubbed on the pork gave it some great flavor and zing, and the ancho chile sauce was excellent--dark, rich, and very flavorful.  Rodil noticed that I was almost snorting the sauce and he asked if I wanted more, the pusher.  He brought a small round dish with extra ancho sauce.  I dipped my tenderloin in the sauce with abandon and joy!  The tamal was superb.  What an interesting twist on the common tamal.\n\nMy choice for dessert was Chocolate Bread Pudding with toasted bourbon marshmallow squares and graham cracker crisps on top.  The chocolate was semi-sweet and this was a fine ending to the meal.  It wasn't as sweet as most desserts and it complimented the flavors from the pork.\n\nI had the best seat in the house in my mind.  I was near the back of the restaurant seated along a railing where I could watch the chefs do their work.  I had a good view of the grill where the steaks were cooked, and I could see into the salad/dessert preparation area.  Right near me was the staging area where two people oversaw the distribution of food.  When an order came in, they each got a copy and they both checked to see things were correct.  The person working on the outside nearest me wiped the dishes to remove any stray food so presentation was perfect.\n\nI enjoyed the meal.  I was not hurried but things moved along at a good pace.

I find him to be an arrogant jerk, something I'm sure he's heard before so I don't particularly feel bad about saying it. We went to Mesa Grill. \n\nI know he's supposed to be known for his burgers and what not, so I ordered the Mesa burger, which came with seasoned fries. They bring a basket of bread to your table as you sit down, there's raisin bread, jalepeno bread and corn bread. I've been having a corn bread craving for a while and his was jam packed with jalepenos and corn, which is nice, but it lacked that buttery good moistness I'm used to in cornbread. The regular Jalepeno bread was yummy. I even tried the raisin bread even though I don't particularly care for raisins, it was good, nothing outstanding. \n\nFinally my burger came. And I was excited. The fries looked well seasoned, only to find out that they're really well seasoned in the middle of the bowl but as you moved outwards it became blander. And there was no salt and pepper on the table, I understand the reasoning that if it's cooked well you don't need salt and pepper. But I kind of needed salt and pepper.  The fries were crisp and had a great crunch. The burger itself was very juicy. Cheese, onions, spicy mustard on the side, ketchup also on the side, trying to get the condiments in was a hassle so I ended up dipping smaller pieces. Overall, good burger, hearty, filling, comforting. Can I get a better one for less than 16$, Absolutely. \n\nHOWEVER, I will absolutely give Bobby this, that his staff is fantastically trained. Our waiter went out of his way to take pictures of our table for us, going up to the rotisserie, taking pictures from the level above us, etc. It was very nice of him, he even offered us a free cappuccino after finding out we're college students (thus probably weren't going to order it anyway because of funds). He took really good care of us throughout our meal.

His only show at the time was the original Grillin and Chillin where he was partnered up with a bona fide hick in overalls.  Then Bobby caused all sorts of hullaballoo by standing on his cutting board.  Over time, I slowly began to accept that he really was not so bad as a personality and possibly even good as a chef.  So personality differences aside, I made a brunch reservation for Mesa Grill on my most recent visit to Las Vegas.  \n\nThe bread basket made an immediate impact.  It contained two types: a jalapeno cheddar bread and a corn muffin.  The jalapeno cheddar bread was not at all a wallflower.  It packed a really spicy kick from the peppers and a salty crust from the cheese.  The corn bread was soft and airy and could barely be buttered.   \n\nWe ordered two appetizers, one of which was the rough cut tuna nachos.  I was ready to dismiss this altogether because everyone knows rough cut tuna nachos means Mexicanafied tuna tartar.  Well, yes, but it was such a different and delicious dish that I would not make such lame generalizations again.  The blue corn chips were freshly fried and incredibly crisp.  The tuna was not a dice/mash of tuna odds and ends but beautiful jeweled cubes of red tuna.  It seemed to be the perfect compliment to the cool avocado crema and the spicy mango habanero hot sauce.  When we ordered this our server went out of his way to warn us that the tuna was going to be served raw.  This is Vegas after all and how horrifying might it be for someone to expect canned tuna on tortilla chips and get this beautiful thing instead? \n\nThe next appetizer was equally delicious and one that most people rave about.  A moist tamal has been covered with sauteed tiger shrimp and a garlic cream sauce.   It was a nice change of pace to dip the tender shrimp and masa into the velvety sauce.  \n\nFor his entree, John ordered the New Mexico spiced pork tenderloin sandwich grilled red onion, arugula, ancho chili mayo and spicy fries.  This was a perfectly good sandwich but not as memorable as the other things we tried.  The pork was room temperature and I would have much preferred it hot and freshly sliced.  \n\nThe only dish I might not get again was my own.  I grew up eating homemade chile rellenos and this version was little too clean and precise.  The chile was very neatly and uniformly coated in a cornmeal crust and stuffed with manchego and roasted eggplant.  The cornmeal was crisp but too thick and I much prefer queso fresco to the much more pungent taste of the goat's milk manchego. I did however, like the sweet and sour combination of the red pepper and balsamic vinegar sauces. \n\nI must give Senor Flay some credit.  It was a really good meal and he really has a way with flavors and sauces.  He didn't shy away from authentic ingredients and a good amount of heat.

I had trouble hearing our server sometimes.  He did a nice job making his recommendations from the menu and warning that the signature dish (pork tenderloin) is 7 out of 10 spicy (which actually dissuaded me from ordering it), and did not balk when I decided to order three appetizers instead of an entree nor did he act particularly annoyed when all three of us drank water (we'd already had our one drink for the evening while waiting for our reservation).  But, he may have been tired from the long night because there wasn't the same level of enthusiasm I have gotten the past few nights from my servers at Wolfgang Puck in MGM, Fiamma and Otto Enoteca.  Still, we did not get poor service so I am not complaining - just saying it wasn't at the same level.\n\nI ordered the goat cheese queso fundido (which was brought as a starter), the tiger shrimp w/ corn tamale, and the chicken tacos appetizers (which were brought together as the entree).

It comes with a mixture of peppers on top for which the tastes blend beautifully.  I could have made a meal of this.  There were a lot more chips than I needed for the cheese but it was a decent sized portion regardless.  This would be a good appetizer to share if you're looking for something shareable.\n\nMy second favorite was the tamale.  One thing I love about New Mexico style cuisine is their use of sweet corn.  The sweet corn tamale was delicious, the cilantro creme complemented it very well, and the tiger shrimps were cooked just right, succulent and juicy.  \n\nI have mixed feelings about the chicken tacos.  They come with a chile peanut sauce -- which I feel I would have preferred without the chile part of it.  It had a smokey flavor which didn't work for me.

The steak was nicely charred on the outside and perfectly medium rare. The rub had a combination of savory and sweet in it and there were 2 sauces. A spicy green sauce and some kind of red sauce. They were both very good but the green on was my favorite. The cauliflower was to die for! I also had tastes of the salmon which was perfectly cooked and had a really lovely sauce and the pork tenderloin which has a very tasty rub.

The waiter apologized for the delay... and we waited some more.  Finally we asked to speak to the manager.

The manager was very nice, apologized, and told us there would be no charge for the burgers. \n\nThe food was great.  The fries were absolutely perfect - maybe the best I've ever had.

We promptly obtained drinks from the bartender, and were ushered to our table without issue.  However, our server seemed displeased that we had ordered drinks from the bar thus lessening his sale for our table.  We ordered two of the Tiger shrimp tamales which arrived at an unsettlingly fast pace.

My steak arrived and I noted how truly pleasing it was to the eye; however, I was disheartened that such an exquisite piece of meat seemed over powered by the bountiful amount of sauce on the plate.  Once I had cut into my steak and taken a bite I was instantaneously reminded that this was Chef Bobby Flay's house and his cooking was inextricably linked to him.  The protein on my plate was classic and refined and delicious, yet it had been arrogantly and flamboyantly altered to meet the needs of a Chef's personality.  The two sauces on the plate competed with the beef and reminded me of an episode of \"Throwdown\" except no one won, and my palate was an innocent bystander.\n\nI looked for solace in the sides on the table and it was then I noticed that the recommended sprouts were missing.  After some time, we got the server's attention and asked him to forget the sprouts since we probably wouldn't need them or have room for them at this point.  He blatantly disregarded this request and demanded that we try them, because to do so would somehow be a personal affront to him.  We yielded.  When the sprouts arrived they were undercooked and over-seasoned to the point of sheer carelessness.  We each sampled one for the humor of it but left them on the table as a comedic reminder of how far off this meal had gone.\n\nIn summaton, this restaurant has the location, the ambience and the kitchen to be elite.

It is Bobby Flay we're talking about.\n\nThe main dish was rib eye steak.  I ordered medium rare but the waitress suggested medium due to the rarity near the bone.  Seems some people don't like it that rare.    Turns out the inside near the bone was pretty good.  Tender and a small amount of pink.  The only issue was the ends of the rib eye was burnt and cooked all the way through.  Oh well next time I stick with what I know.   The steak was generally minimalist which I like.  Not too much sauce just salt and pepper.  The steak was quite large, enough to share a small piece with 4 others. \n\nThe favors were returned and I got to taste the pork tenderloin.  Now that is a great dish.  Three tender cylinders about one and a half inches in diameter and two inches tall.  How they cook the meat through and keep it so tender with the tasty crust not burned is impressive.\n\nWe all shared the toffee pudding which as tasty.  All in all the dinner was just fun.

Their lunch features a lot of lunch style plates--sandwiches and salads, but they actually also have several starters from their dinner menu and a few entrees.\n\nFlay's food is southwestern style so there are a lot of Mexican influences.  Most of the dishes veer on the sweet and spicy side (though the food at Mesa Grill, at least what I've had, never gets that spicy).\n\nMesa Grill is like a lot of upscale Mexican restaurants.  It is quite pricey even though what's on the menu is the kind of food you can get at less expensive restaurants.  At least Mesa Grill uses more expensive ingredients like duck, ahi tuna and scallops.\n\nThe breadbasket at Mesa Grill was an assortment of cold bread.  There was a blue corn muffin, which while not dry, was too crumbly and a little bland.  The fruit and nut bread was decent, but the bread was a little soft and the fruit did not pop like the fruit in Picasso's fruit and nut bread.  Picasso's bread was heartier too.\n\nThe jalapeno bread was too soft as well.  There were a few jalapeno bits in it, but I think more of them would have made the bread more memorable.\n\nI started with the rough cut tuna nachos, which was chopped raw tuna mixed with a vinaigrette and capers.  The tuna came with a mango puree, avocado crema and habanero sauce.\n\nThe tuna was fresh, nicely moist and soft.  I really liked the sauces.  Both the mango puree and avocado crema were very clean, smooth and creamy.  The mango puree was sweet but not overpowering while the avocado crema was cool and refreshing.  The habanero was noticeable and gave little pops of spiciness (though I think I personally would have preferred more heat).\n\nThe dish was served with two kinds of chips.  The best was the blue corn--light, thin and crispy.  I was not a fan of the other chip--it was thick, sandy on the outside and too mealy.  I've had that style of chip before, but I don't know what it's called.\n\nFor my entree, I went with one of their starters--tiger shrimp with a roasted corn tamale and a sweet corn cream sauce.  I liked the shrimp--plump and moist.  I prefer shrimp with more color and seasoning, but this was still good.\n\nThe corn tamale was just okay.  It had a good corn flavor and moistness, but it was uneven.  Parts of the tamale were not smooth; the masa clumped together and was even a little dry.  The corn cream sauce was not too heavy and was creamy and sweet.  Even more so than the nachos, I think this dish could have used more heat.\n\nFor dessert, I went with their sticky toffee pudding, which was a big portion; it had a good flavor though it was a tad dry.  The sticky toffee pudding came with a salted cajeta, which had a great consistency--very fine, which made it feel more like a red wine reduction rather than a thick and sticky caramel.\n\nSome salted caramel desserts can have a mix of sweet and salty (whether just right or too salty) while others can be just a less-sweet caramel.  It was the latter with this salted cajeta.  The biggest salty component came from the salt sprinkled on top of the cake.\n\nThere was also some vanilla ice cream and it was creamy (and not icy at all), but there was too little of it.  The cake combined with the salted cajeta was quite sweet and there needed to be a different flavor to balance it out.\n\nService was very good.  The food was upscale but still casual and approachable and this was very much in harmony with the service.  The service was definitely polite, professional and polished, but it was also quite friendly.  The food also came out at a quick pace.\n\nPrices are high; Mesa Grill is probably overpriced, but that is often the case at Vegas restaurants.  Still, almost the entire lunch menu was below $20.\n\nIn terms of decor/atmosphere, the contemporary room (which sits right next to the casino) had warm (but not garish) Southwestern accents.  The room was nice enough, but it was not that memorable.\n\nMesa Grill is a solid and satisfying Vegas restaurant.  If you don't like upscale Mexican spots because the food does not seem worth the extra cost, I'm not sure if Mesa Grill is going to change your mind (though I do think Mesa Grill is significantly better than some upscale Mexican spots out there like Border Grill and the high quality ingredients like ahi tuna and veal chop from a previous trip are represented well).\n\nThere are definitely some well known Vegas restaurants putting out subpar food, but I have not felt that way on my two trips to Mesa Grill.

I could not get every little bit of cheese off the iron dish and that made me sad.   \n\nThe lamb was probably the best lamb we've ever had (and I'm a connoisseur of lamb, it is one of my favorite dishes.

The coconut cake was a very large portion, easily split between 2-3 people.\n\nOur server on the first night was excellent.\n\nThe second night we ordered the queso fundido again along with the duck pancake for appetizers.

For starters, we went with the server's recommendation. She said it is the most \"popular\" appetizer - Tiger Shrimp with Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale and cilantro sauce.  This was SMALL.  There were four medium sized (I think they were smaller than they should have been) shrimp with a tamale on the side. It really looked like the tamale was the main part of the dish and the shrimp were the side garnish.  There was nothing special about the shrimp. They looked like four cooked and peeled shrimp. I was pretty disappointed.\n\nFor the mains, Hubs had the rabbit  - Cascabel Chile Crusted Rabbit with toasted chile cous cous, almonds, currants in a smoked red pepper sauce and I had the Halibut with green chile curry sauce and corn and cactus salsa.

Nice crunch on the top of the fish and the green chile curry sauce was mild.  I liked it. It was a huge portion of fish.

Fresh ahi, garnished with an avocado and mango glaze, what I think is homemade tortilla chips, it was good, don't get me wrong. It was pretty ordinary though, although bf loved the mango glaze. \n-Tiger Shrimp & Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale: grilled shrimp in some kinda creamy delicious sauce (I think it's creme fraiche, but not sure), with an incredibly yummy corn tamale. This was amazing. My only suggestion would be to add more shrimp. By the end of the dish we were out of shrimp but still had a substantial amount of tamale. \n-Entree: New Mexico Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin: This was so yummy. Three perfectly portioned pieces of the perfect amount of pink, tender pieces (guess that's why they call it TENDERloin).

I confess that me and my friend were seduced by the star name on the name to make reservations here for dinner but although it artificially raises its prices because of a vague association to Bobby Flay its dishes retain the famous chef's signature style. Which basically means that they are slightly spicier and over-sauced than you'll probably find at home. \n\nPrice was MESA is \"spendy\" but not ridiculous like some of Caesar's other offerings (Ie. Homestead Steakhouse). The ambiance is trendy and upbeat;  I was actually surprised by how bright and colorful the decoration inside was.

For me the highlight of the dinner was the Rabbit which is perfectly seasoned and prepared in 2 distinct styles. My friend enjoyed his entree and desert as well but we both found the side dishes disappointing. They were bland and the collard greens did not taste at all fresh. However the side dishes are unnecessary I think: the entrees all come with some vegetables and the serving of rabbit in particular is too big for one person. I could only get through 2/3 of it before surrendering. \n\nA final somewhat strange note: The hosts like to arrange the seating so that people who are dressed similarly are next to each other. This leads to the restaurant divided into several clusters: 1) filled with men in Hawaiian shirts and polos, 2) trendy ladies in cocktail dresses, 3) those dressed to impress and those elderly gentlemen with young trophy wives.

I don't think their \"Mesa Margarita\" is good but not great. It's a good start that runs slightly sweet without being the typical \"punch-style\" margarita. With the Especial Margarita, you call the tequila and pick one of three orange liqueurs. If you've got a favorite tequila in mind you want this.  Finally, they have the Partida. It's served straight up in a martini glass. But you can get it in a bucket if you prefer. Because there's no ice, it's going to look small. Don't slam this drink. Enjoy it!  Some people think it's too sour, I think it's an amazing drink. \n\nOn our first visit a few years ago, lunch was average. The food was good but the various odd plate shapes actually made eating a bit awkward, maybe we were just tired after the flight.

At the start, the wine sommelier switched gears into a beer and tequila expert without missing a beat. I'm pretty sure this isn't his job, but he stepped up and took our entire drink order. We were being pretty picky about what we wanted (me about the margaritas and another guy about beer and tequila combinations), he accommodated everything, offered great alternatives when they didn't stock what we asked for and never made us feel like we were too demanding (we probably were). Our whole party clicked with the waitress. She played along well with our \"we're going to be here a while, drink and eat a bunch, we might be a pain in the ass, and we'll tip well for it\" vibe. Seriously the best service I can remember in a restaurant.

This was the second time I had been to the restaurant, the first time being about 7 years ago.  I had fond memories of Mesa Grill from the past, but was slightly disappointed this time around.  Since I was not paying, I only ordered an entree, so I ordered the ribeye.  The meat was perfectly cooked to medium ( the server suggested this instead of medium rare)  ... it looked like medium rare to me anyway.  Perhaps, she was heading off some potential problem that the cooks might have been having with undercooking meat?  The steak was flavorful, but could have been accompanied with more of the sauces that came along side of it.  My only issue with the steak was that it did not come with accompaniments.  Every other entree selection (besides the filet) came with a side dish or tamale of some sort.  For $48, I expected something.  The waitress suggested that we order a couple of sides to split, so we got the corn and the spinach.  Both portions were TINY and really could not be split unless your idea of splitting them is a tablespoon serving per person.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable although a bit condescending... maybe that is not the best word...  over-confident perhaps?  Anyway, she was ok but kind of icy.

Theirs is a modern, elegant take on Southwestern fare. There was a splash of sweet and a kick of spice in each dish. The meat was tender and the service was excellent. Our server, Joel, was attentive and informative.  He made a lovely meal all the more enjoyable. \n\nEXPECTATION OF THE FAMOUS:  Emily Dickenson lamented, \"How dreary - to be - Somebody!\" I don't know how \"dreary\" fame is nowadays, but there are drawbacks.  Clearly Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill both suffers and benefits from his fame. My advice? Let go of whatever you think of Bobby Flay when you sit down to eat. Don't allow preconceived notions fed by reality television shows to color your expectation.  Many fabulous restaurants on the strip are owned/led by accomplished, talented, and (when we are lucky) creative chefs. At Mesa Grill (MG) the owner/executive chef also happens to be famous.  That fact should be the least important part of your experience with this place.\n\nTHE FOOD\n\nTIGER SHRIMP: This delectable bite was my favorite of the night. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and like many dishes at Mesa Grill, comes with corn.  This appetizer was creamy and sweet. It was a gentle start to the meal.\n\nBLUE CORN PANCAKE: Served with barbequed duck, this dish was a tad sweet for my taste. But the tender meat and complex sauce compensated for the overly sweet bite.\n\nNEW MEXICAN SPICE RUBBED PORK TENDERLOIN and GRILLED LAMB PORTERHOUSE CHOPS: Both dishes packed a (now familiar) sweet and spicy punch. By the time the grilled lamb came out, I was a bit tired of the sweet dishes. But in fairness the \"sweet + meat\" combo works. For spice reluctant palates, the sweet provides a gentle method for accepting the kick in many of the dishes.  There is a purpose behind the flavor selections. I appreciate the thoughtfulness behind the dishes.  What more could I ask?\n\nCHURROS: Warm, sweet, and light.\n\nPRICKLY PEAR MARGHARITA: Sweet and expected.\n\nVERDICT: This was a lovely meal. The food was well prepared and the overall experience was enjoyable. While I'm not putting Mesa Grill on my rotation, I would certainly visit with a friend from out of town. There is a slight.... artificiality to the place that I can't pin down. It's a slick establishment.  They are looking to leave you feeling something. I may not have been as moved as MG management would have liked, but I appreciate the professionalism and the effort.   There is nothing \"dreary\" about doing something well.

However, I was attending a show at 10pm and the two reservations available were 5:30 and 8:30.  The hostess who answered the call was kind enough to tell me that the 8:30 time slot was going to be cutting it close for us and informed me that we could dine at the bar, with a full menu.  I thanked her and figured those were my plans.\n\nThe restaurant ambiance is awesome.  The table layout gives each party their own little area to feel cozy, but not alone in the restaurant.  The vibe is energetic and hip.  \n\nUpon arrival, we told the hostess that we were planning to dine at the bar because the wait for a table was 45-50 minutes.  She pointed out that a few specific guests sitting at the bar would be leaving to go to their table shortly.  I appreciated the tip.  Within maybe 15 minutes, the seats became available and we hopped up to the bar.  \n\nThe bartender greeted us and I didn't order a specialty drink, but my Ketel martini was made perfectly. \n\nI had already eaten a lot earlier that day, so I ended up only ordering an entree: Black Florida Grouper.  My expectations were extremely high for this restaurant and unfortunately, the entree fell short.  My grouper was way overcooked.  It was tough and it didn't flake at all.  It was dry, but some of the sauce made up for that.  The flavor was definitely there -- the execution was not.  My friend ordered the Cornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno, which she said was delicious.  \n\nAdditionally, being that I work in the service industry, I do not complain a lot and chose not to with this dish.

It was okay, but not spectacular--the eggs were a little underdone for me and there was a lot of cilantro in the hash (too much in my mind).

I was thrilled to get the chance to eat at your place in Caesar's Palace. While I enjoyed very much the cactus pear margarita and the goat cheese queso fundido, I was very disappointed by our server as well as the quality of the Mesa Burger my husband and I shared. \nLet me start with our server. If his presentation style was anymore negative about what WASN'T available on the menu that afternoon, we might have left had we not really wanted to try your food and been as hungry as we were. It's one thing to be out of something but it was the WAY he said it. \"Just so you know and don't get your heart set on it, we are OUT of the ribs. They aren't that good anyway\" was how it was presented. Hmmm. Not good. He then described the Tuna \"Nachos\" as being more Tuna tar-tar with a side of tortilla chips and said \"unless you like raw tuna, this isn't for you\". Um...ok. You get the point. This guy clearly needed some training. And I won't throw him under the bus and name him here but email me if you want to know more.\nAs for the burger. I'll go back to our server....we ordered the burger to share and ordered it medium well. He repeated it back to us, medium well and confirmed we wanted to split the order. When the burger arrived, it was all on one plate. I figured he didn't tell the expediter or just didn't note it on the order. We wait a couple minutes and he finally appears with 2 plates and a knife for us to split the burger ourselves. Um...ok. I cut into the burger and it is rare. Ok, rare is an understatement. It was raw. Blood raw. Definitely NOT medium well like we ordered and he confirmed. So we had to flag down a waiter as ours had conveniently disappeared. He came back and said that we had told him medium rare. Um...no we didn't. We never eat anything rare and he had repeated back to us what we wanted which is why I knew he knew what we ordered and just wanted to put it on us. So a new burger came a few minutes later and while that wasn't medium well either, it was a lot better than the raw that we got initially. Unfortunately, your chefs feel the need to ridiculously overseason the burgers to the point where you can hardly taste the burger itself. And the fries? Ugh. An over-seasoned, over fried mess. There was a coating on the fries that totally took away from the potato flavor of the fries. \nQuite honestly, this first visit to one of your restaurants was a huge disappointment. I expect more from someone of your caliber and while you didn't cook any of this yourself, this was a representation of your brand. I don't know if that is fair or not, but I guess if you are going to put yourself in the position of being on a pedestal by being on television, you need to hold those who are running your brand to a higher standard. If this is what your restaurants are putting out, I think that you need to spend less time at Food Network and MORE time in your restaurants.  Please read my review on Holsteins and visit their restaurant to see how to really get things done. \nThanks for reading this and I hope you will take it to heart....even though I figure you'll probably never see this and those who really should see it won't really do anything about it.

Total turn-off.  Not the kitchens fault if the server biffed the order...but \n\nOnce we sent it back and it came back out, it was cooked correctly, but honestly, still was not a burger to write home about.

The meat was very tender and flavorful. I am not always crazy about duck, so this was a pleasant surprise \n\nGreen Chili Burger with fries-Ok, think big thick burger patty. It was juice and delicious and cooked right to order. My boyfriend often complains that burgers are overdone, even if you ask for them radium rare or medium, and he said this one was just perfect. If you get a chance walk by the grill and look at all of the burgers being cooked. \nSorbet -Mango, Pear, and Raspberry. They were all good but I really liked the nice soft flavor of the pair.\n\nBread-The bread comes with each table, and I am only mentioned it because it was kind of different. There were several different little selections, such as a cranberry scone, a corn muffin, a coffee cake, and something else sweet.

I have eaten here a few times in the past couple of years. Each time I have had a great experience. The must try items are the tiger shrimp tamale, the rough cut tuna nachos, crab cakes, spicy chicken sweet potato hash, the chile rellenos, and their desserts.\n\nThere is a reason why Mesa wins every year when it comes to the most money raised for our local food bank. They put out a well balanced menu that gives the guest the biggest bang for their buck. The portion sizes are scaled back, but leaves you feeling full. I started with the rough cut tuna nachos for my appetizer. It is served like tuna poki. The fish is sashimi grade and served raw. Tosses with chipotle puree, cilantro, capers, and placed on top of a mango habanero puree and avocado crema. The blue corn and tortilla chips are the only utensils you need to scoop up all of this deliciousness. \n\nI got the crab cakes last year when they ran this special which lead me to order the green chile burger this time around. The meat tends to lose it's form and crumbles easily. I ended up using a fork and knife halfway through. The bechamel cheese sauce is delicious. Paired with the pickled onions and pablano peppers gave it a range of depth. If given the choice again, I would have gone with the crab cakes. \n\nThe desserts changes ever day depending on what the chef chooses. We got the deep dish banana cream pie. The Frangelico cream only gives hints of the alcohol. The surprise comes from the contrast in textures. The dense custard differs from the soft cream which compliments the bananas and praline disk on top. I am a huge fan of Bobby Flay's desserts. The sticky toffee pudding is not a traditional version, but it is so good. I also like the strawberry shortcake.

Our wait was to be 45 mins unless we could find something at the bar. No problem, we only had to wait about 5 mins to get a banquet.  However, once we were seated,  we did not see our server/cocktail waitress for at least 10 mins.  She finally dropped menus and didn't return again for a while.  This was odd to me because it didn't seem like she would have been responsible for a lot of tables unless she was assigned a section outside of the bar as well, which seems like a poor decision because my party felt neglected-- compounding that with the number of loud men drinking around us it made for a rather uncomfortable environment.  A party member approached the bartender ( who happened to have a number of empty stools in front of him) to inquire about our server and purchasing a drink, but unfortunately he was quite rude and dismissive-- he did not offer to serve her a cocktail and told her \"go sit down the server will get there when she can.\"  Hardly the type of response I would expect from a place where I would be paying $40 an entree.  Wow.\n\nWhen our server came over she took our orders with no questions, and was helpful in that she knew the vouchers we were using-- she was clearly familiar with the promotion, which was nice.  \n\nDespite the bartender's rudeness, he poured a very good martini.  The food too was lovely.  The side asparagus and corn were fresh and flavorful!  I also loved the ahi in the ahi tartare and the chicken from the skewers was excellently flavored!!  I don't regret the food, but overall the experience was not what I would have hoped for especially for the money.  I might return to the New York location with a reservation...

I've heard the dinner there is great but we decided to go on a Sunday for lunch. Unfortunately the menu posted at the door was very misleading. Both a brunch and lunch menu were posted. So we assumed both were being offered. Since the lunch menu looked very appetizing we decided to stay and enjoy. \n\nHowever, once we were sat it was revealed to us that Mesa Grill was ONLY serving brunch (it was 2:00 PM) and would not offer us lunch. WHAT?!?! No exceptions! Since they would not budge on this rule we found it to be very rude. Especially since we were willing to pay. Needless to say we were very disappointed, 3:00 pm was only 40 minutes away for them to serve lunch. \n\nThe only good thing out of the meal were the margarita peach and pear cactus drinks and goat cheese queso fundido dip (though the chips were VERY stale). On top of everything else I selected the Blue Corn Crusted Halibut only to be told later that they were totally out of the fish. They must have had a slamming breakfast to be totally out. I ended up ordering the Eggs + Aged Striploin Tortilla, thinking it would be just as good. I was wrong, the order came out VERY cold with very little taste. I couldn't hardly eat 1/2 of my dish and honestly the only plate that was halfway appetizing out of the 3 of us at our table was the Lamb Cobb Salad, which you could barely screw up since it was a salad.\n\nI must say Bobby Flay - if this was my restaurant I would pay special attention to menu times being offered for lunch & brunch as well as food being offered on the menu versus what's being delivered out of the kitchen.

So we checked out the wait at Mesa Grill, and the tables were filled, but they were able to seat us without too long of a wait--thankfully!!! I was famished!!\n\nRight in the heart of Caesar Palace's casino, the decor is colorful and inviting. The hosts are friendly and welcoming. The dress code can be anywhere from casual to dressy. We were dressed casually, but never felt that we were underdressed. The atmosphere felt easy and had an eclectic array of patrons!\n\nWe started off with classic margaritas. Not too tart or too sweet, but refreshing. They brought out a bread basket which came with an assortment of cornbread, a jalape\u00f1o bread, and a raisin bread--all done with a southwestern flair. The jalape\u00f1o bread definitely had a kick!\n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the shrimp and grits. It was one of the specials they had for the night. Two jumbo sized shrimp on a bed of corn and grits, with a spicy, chile type of sauce with hints of cilantro and peanuts (which gave it a Thai kind of flair, I think).\n\nFor our main course, I ordered the blue corn crusted halibut. It was served on top of a \"warm salsa cruda\" which was a mixture of olives, tomatoes, jalape\u00f1os, and capers. The blue corn crust added a delightful crisp to the fresh and flaky halibut, and it's flavor and texture were only complimented by the salsa. Delicious! I also ordered a tamale as a side. It had some jalape\u00f1o butter melted right into the tamale--yum! My boyfriend had another one of the specials: the pork chops. It was served with vegetables and potatoes, and had a nice smokey, spicy flavor. My boyfriend's mom had the salmon with a side of mashed potatoes. The salmon was grilled and slightly charred, which added a good smokey flavor to her dish, as well. The mashed potatoes were also delicious!\n\nAt this point, we were pretty stuffed but my boyfriend's family is friends with Chef Augustine, and he brought out 3 different kinds of dessert: a strawberry tarte, an assortment of sorbets, and a coconut cake. The strawberry tarte was my favorite. It reminded me of a fancy strawberry shortcake, a buttery tarte shell, filled with a strawberry compote type of consistency, topped with a fresh whipped cream. The sorbet assortment came with 3 different favors: coconut, raspberry, and mango habanero (which was such a strange and exciting burst of flavor lol). The coconut cake consisted of several layers with a coconut creme anglaise and toasted coconut--not to sweet, great with coffee, a must for coconut lovers!\n\nFinally, for the service.

As soon as we got to our room in the Monte Carlo, we naturally began searching Yelp for nearby restaurants. When we found out that one of our favorite Food Network Chefs, Bobby Flay, had a restaurant at Caesar's Palace, it instantly shot to the top of our list. \n\nWe went to Mesa Grill for our last night, after going to Wolfgang Puck's, Lupo and Emeril Lagasse's Table Ten the nights before. The location was very convenient since Caesar's Palace is in the middle of the strip and the restaurant itself was absolutely gorgeous, very clean and modern. Everything you could possibly want for a classy Las Vegas experience. \n\nPersonally I still had some doubts because Tex Mex is not my girlfriend's or my favorite type of cuisine, we never seek it out, but I would say I don't have much knowledge about it either. I didn't find the whole idea of Tex Mex too appealing.\n\nI started getting even more concerned when I found the wait staff to be a little pretentious and more than a little snooty. Our main waiter in particular made me feel like we didn't belong since we're a young couple blowing all our money on this short getaway and not some rich established older people who can really afford to got to a place like this without worrying about making rent. Anyway he seemed rather annoyed at our amateur etiquette overall ignorance regarding such extravagance. But I think we won him over with our charm by the end.\n\nThe man who took our cocktail orders was by far the best, giving us all kinds of knowledge about the menu, making friendly conversation, sharing his personal preferences and just really making time to stop by a few times just so see how our drink experience specifically was going. The drinks were absolutely delicious.\n\nBe excited about some pretty good free bread to help prepare you for the journey ahead. The bread grew on me as I ate more, but it was nothing to\n\nWe actually tried to save money by getting two appetizers, the Tiger Shrimp Tamale and Blue Corn Pancake, and only getting one entree, the Chile Relleno (one of my favorite dishes in life that was conveniently the most inexpensive entree on the menu). But when we tasted the appetizers, we instantly ordered another Entree, the Pork Tenderloin. The Tiger Shrimp Tamale especially was like tasting heaven. It the shrimp was zesty and bold pairing perfectly with the creamy garlic sauce. The texture of the tamale was very pleasing and the consistency  was tender, but still substantial. The Blue Corn Pancake was also delicious, the flavor was more simple, the duck was very juicy and was smothered in a succulent dark, deep, rich, velvety sauce. It was very aromatic, just a truly seductive dish.\n\nThe Chile Relleno had the most stunning presentation in my opinion. The cornmeal crust is that perfect amount of golden crisp, not oily. It's satisfying cracking it open like Creme Brulee and unleashing the cheezy melty, spicy explosion within. There are so many textural layers that make the experience of eating it so dynamic and just adds to the diversity of flavor. I've never had anything like it; by far one of the best dishes I've ever tasted in my entire life. It was like eating art.\n\nThe Pork Tenderloin was also breathtaking to look at, and my girlfriend would say it was the prettiest presentation, but we would both agree it was the best dish of the whole meal. I never knew that meat could be prepared in such a way where every nuance, every single note of flavor possible to achieve in the universe can sing in harmony together so immaculately. Every single flavor that has ever excited my taste buds came flooding back and brought back friends I never knew existed and we danced, danced, danced! Pure ecstasy. After that is kind of a blur. All I know is that I had eaten the best thing I have ever tasted.\n\nAnd that wasn't even the end. We were so drunk on the pleasures of food and drink that we ordered dessert, the Toasted Coconut Layer Cake. The coconut shone throughout the dish, the cake was incredibly moist, the icing was soft and delicate and the Cr\u00e8me Anglaise just took the cake to another level of decadence. \n\nOverall the meal was one of the best in my whole life. The experience was also one of the best in my entire life, but I wouldn't call the restaurant experience perfect because of the service. In general Las Vegas service lacks in attitude. They do all the right things technically, but their attitude, personality, and what they say always leaves a lot to be desired. There's is rarely genuine friendly service and this restaurant, sadly was no exception in that area. But I still give the restaurant five stars for just being so breathtakingly delicious, the restaurant's atmosphere was beautiful and clean, and the service was still professional, fast and insanely efficient (when we ordered another entree, they still came out at the same time only minutes after we told them).

Craziness persisted.  We saw stuff like sushi in burritos, we saw french fries with kimchi, and we saw bacon in everything.  Before the craze, chefs like Bobby Flay and David Chang established their names with their creative fusion blends.\n\nJust because foods are creative doesn't mean that they'll be good.  One of the problems with fusion foods is that they tend to be one dimensional.  They're usually spicy or tangy or sweet or bacon-infused to the MAX.     \n\nYou gain an appreciation for this place as soon as you try one of their dishes.  Take their popular \"blue corn pancake\", for instance.  It looks simple:  you have a thin blue cornmeal crepe and it's filled with barbecue duck.  You take a bite and you notice the sweet notes of the barbeque sauce.  That taste fades and you then notice the tender duck meat.  The dish is small, so it forces you to eat slowly to make it last.   As you chew slowly, the subtle, nutty heat of the habanero sauce begins to rise.     \n\nFlay's appetizers are full of flavors that are distinct without being over-the-top.  \n\nWhen I came here for my birthday dinner with my girlfriend, we opted to sample several appetizer instead of choosing one main course.  We knew that it would be the best way to get a good mix of flavors.  \n\nYou can't miss the roasted garlic tamales with tiger shrimp.  It was a favorite of my girlfriend.  The chef said that it is the most popular appetizer and that the recipe has not changed in twenty years.\n\nMy favorite side dish was their roasted corn.  It reminded me of ordering corn at a park in East LA.   You get the flavors of lime, garlic, white corn, various cheeses.  It's great street food, but improved upon.  But their sweet potatoes are good too.  It's served au gratin.  It's creamy - it's very evident that they used a lot of cream here.  But it also has interesting spice that reminded me of pumpkin pie.   It's a nice, flavorful starch to complement their popular pork tenderloin or coffee-rubbed steak.\n\nThis is fusion done well.

The wife wanted some fish but all they have that night are scallops and a Cioppino, both were not her likings so she decided on a Filet Mignon, medium rare, and we got some spicy sweet potatos on the side.\n\nLet me tell you that the first bite of the Tenderloin, Mesa Grill had me... the meat was soft, very tender, the spices are there and you can really taste them but does not overpower the meat. It was delightful. The wife's filet is holding it's own on the taste department, the rub and the mushrooms are something to behold.  Somehow the star of that meal is the spicy sweet potato, the way it was prepared is something that I have not seen nor tasted before. the potatoes are cut in a rectanglein thin sheets and piled high instead of mashed.

The capers, the mango puree, the little chips they served to scoop it up with - all super delicious.  The tuna was high quality.\n\nEntree - 'Coffee-Rubbed Filet Mignon' - delicious!  My steak was cooked perfectly, was a great cut of meat, and the coffee and ancho chile on the outside really added a lot of flavor.  This was a big win for me.\n\nSide - 'Fresh Corn Tamale + Jalapeno Pesto Butter' - I was not a fan of this.  The tamale was not very moist, and basically tasted like a plain corn tamale that you would get at any regular Mexican restaurant - I didn't really get any flavor from the jalapeno pesto butter that was on it, either.. I can't believe I paid ten bucks for a crappy plain tamale!  \n\nDessert - 'Churros' - not so great.  These churros were pretty weak - they were not fluffy, there was no slightly gooey center and crispy outer.  The sauces were also not very good - there was barely any sauce served with the churros (dunking was impossible) and neither of the sauces had strong (or notable) flavor - I would have preferred one small creamer pot of good mexican chocolate for dipping.\n\nService was very good - our waiter had the right frequency of checking in, and was very tolerant of us being one of the last people in the restaurant.\n\nReally, I want to give Mesa Grill 3 or 3.5 stars because of the inconsistency in quality of dishes across all parts of dinner, but on the strength of the appetizer and main dish, I will go ahead and give them 4 stars..

I was in Vegas this past weekend with 5 of my girlfriends for a girls weekend away.  I convinced them we had to go here for dinner because it was so amazing.  We ended up leaving quite disappointed and it still makes me bummed out to think about our experience.   First off, our appetizers took a long time to come out, but we just figured oh well, and we enjoyed them immensely.   Next came out our main courses.   3 of the 6 dishes that came out (2 filets and 1 salmon) were barely warm.  We kindly told our server about this, and she took them back and brought out new hot plates.  We are paying plenty of money to have our food come out hot.   The manager came over in the midst of this and gave a good fake \"I'm so sorry, yada yada yada\"   He came off like he was just going thru the motions and could care less about our issues.  Again, just blew it off and went about eating our newly delicious hot meals.   About 3/4 the way thru I noticed what looked to be a dark black hair about an inch/inch and 1/2 long in the middle of my sauce and mushrooms that went over my filet.  This instantly made my stomach turn and I was done.   All SIX of us were done at that point.   We had our server come back over and she took the plate without saying much.   She came back about 10 minutes later giving us the bill and saying the manager took off 2 of the plates and that they went back and investigated the hair and they thought it was a bristle from a brush they used in the kitchen.  Almost trying to justify the problem.  About 15 minutes had passed since finding this hair, and the manager FINALLY walks over again and says sorry and have a good night.   2 of the girls with us had been servers for many years and they said he was so incredibly unprofessional and we were all blown away at how this manager handled our situation.   We definitely fell on the younger side of the crowd, so my feeling was that he just kind of disregarded us since we were just younger and maybe he thought we were just looking for trouble.  Not really sure.  We were all dressed up and looked classy for a nice dinner out.   We all grew up going to nice restaurants, so we know what to expect.

Unfortunately, the menu also just seems to never change.  That is the case with a lot of Las Vegas restaurants (for example, Picasso's tasting menu features two courses that have been there forever).  Still, almost the entire menu at Mesa Grill has remained the same since my first visit a long time ago.\n\nThe familiar menu has pros and cons.  What it has going for it is that a lot of the dishes are tried and true.  In addition, most guests come to Las Vegas rarely and would likely only dine at Mesa Grill once so the limited changes in the menu would not impact most customers.  On the other hand, the menu feels a tad dated; Mesa Grill does not really capitalize on the latest trends, progression in cooking techniques and popular protein cuts and produce.\n\nI started with their tiger shrimp with roasted garlic corn tamale.  It is a popular dish and for good reason.  The tamale was hearty and had a tasty and moist cornbread-like texture.  The shrimp was good and plump and the cilantro sauce was also nice though I personally would have preferred it to be spicier.\n\nFor my entree, I went with their New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin, which was served with a bourbon and ancho chile sauce and a sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter.  Unlike the shrimp and corn tamale, this entree was incredibly spicy.  The pork had a rub that had a lot of heat (the sauce had some heat too).  There was nothing really there to cut the heat so it was the kind of dish you get tired and bored of eating (and may struggle to finish).\n\nThe pork tenderloin (a very underappreciated cut) was cooked very nicely here.  The pork was tender and had a good amount of moisture, which is rare given the limited amount of fat with this cut.  The sweet potato tamale had a noticeable sweet potato flavor, but it lacked the more tamale-like texture of the corn tamale from my starter.\n\nMy dessert was a sticky chocolate cake.  It was very similar to Mesa Grill's previous sticky toffee pudding.  The cake had a similar glaze too--warm and a mix of salty and sweet.  The cake itself was not that great--a standard grocery store-like cake (similar ordinary chocolate flavor and similar texture as what you would get at a Ralphs or Vons).  There was also just too much cake especially given that the ice cream was an almost ridiculously small portion.\n\nService was fine.  The staff was pleasant and the food came out at a quick pace.  I felt the staff could have been more attentive.\n\nPrices are actually not that bad at Mesa Grill.  Prices are very high, but that is common with most Las Vegas restaurants.  At least, they serve very substantial portions and the quality of ingredients is good.\n\nThe dining room is contemporary and showcases an open kitchen.  It is a very comfortable dining room.  Unfortunately, the restaurant is not completely closed in by glass as it may appear.  There are quite a few open areas where the large glass panes do not meet.  Given the proximity to the casino slot machines, cigarette smoke does waft in, which might create an undesirable dining experience if you are too close to the restaurant's outside wall.\n\nThere are definitely some good (and even great) things about Mesa Grill.  They have a few delicious items on their menu and most of the food is well prepared.  If you have never been to Mesa Grill, it is worth a visit; the restaurant also feels more worth the money than other celebrity chef backed restaurants in Las Vegas.  If you have been already though, Mesa Grill is not as exciting; the menu does not change much so it does kind of feel like the kitchen is really just going through the motions.\n\nMesa Grill is located in Caesars Palace.

Mistakes happen, so that's understandable. What I didn't like however, was that my scallop dish and our other side dishes were sent to wait under the warmer while a new rabbit was fired. It took around 8-9 minutes (umm yes, of course I timed it!). That means my scallop entree sat under a warmer for 8-9 minutes and so did my brussel sprouts and queso mashed potatoes.

I went here because this was the only Michelin Star that he ever earned. This restaurant is no longer a Michelin Star. (Michelin no longer does star ratings on Las Vegas restaurants.) I've eaten at a number of Michelin Star restaurants, but I've eaten at restaurants that were at that time were Michelin Star rated but no longer has a star (Fleur de Lys and Alexander's Steakhouse). So eating here would provide me a good comparison to restaurants that are currently Michelin Star rated and those who were in the past.\n\nI ate here last night. The menu is straightforward a la carte unlike the trendy tasting menu. My server recommended the signature dish is the New Mexico Pork Tenderloin. He also said Mesa is known for their margaritas. I had two items that I plan to ordered. I always see Flay mentioning about blue corn. There were two blue corn items: 1) Blue Corn Pancake 2) Blue Corn Lobster Tacos.  At the suggestion of my server I ordered the lobster tacos.\n\nThe Mesa Grill Margarita arrived before any of my dishes. It was a refreshing drink to start with. The first dish was the lobster tacos. For $20 I was disappointed. There are 3 mini tacos in a blue corn shell. You can taste the spices and lobster however I couldn't taste the blue corn. I should have ordered the Blue Corn Pancake. The entree, which is the signature dish of Mesa Grill, New Mexico Pork Tenderloin was a tastier dish than the lobster tacos. This is one of the more underrated spiciest dishes I ever had. There are the medallions that are covered in spices. Eating this dish takes a while to finish. But in doing so you enjoy each pork medallion, which was moist and tender. I decided not to order dessert.\n\nSo what was the verdict? When I go a fine dining restaurant I want to learn what its cuisine is about. Mesa is supposed to be known for southwest flavors. However when I ate here last night I never understood what southwest flavors were. From other Michelin Star restaurants I've eaten I learned and understood what their cuisine was. Two prime examples are two restaurants in San Francisco: Boulevard and Aziza. When I ate at Boulevard I understood what California cuisine is. When I ate at Aziza I understood what Moroccan cuisine is. But to be fair to Mesa, in comparison to other former Michelin Star restaurants, Mesa is better than Fleur de Lys (San Francisco) but not as good as Alexander's Steakhouse (Cupertino). I think a 3-star rating in my book is fair.\n\nWill I eat at Mesa again? Maybe. However I regret not ordering the Blue Corn Pancake and Chile Relleno. If I did maybe rating would be different. Who knows in the future if Michelin would start rating Las Vegas restaurants?  If Michelin does I can't see Mesa garner its star back at the moment.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 7, "cool": 5}}, {"text": "In my opinion it is nothing stellar, maybe I wasn't quite into the menu as my boyfriend was.

I was wondering when one of these would come to town- what took so long?! I'm a Landry Select Club member, so I can easily rack up more points for rewards (spend $250, get $25 in card credit). \n\nThis one is located next to the Miracle Mile Shops, so here are your options: park at Valet at Todai or park at the Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile Shops parking garage- enter the shopping center but exit out of the Todai side, and take the escalators or in our case, the elevator- we're parents now, so we're pushing a stroller. From here, a host will direct you. You will go through the store, into the elevator and up to the 3rd floor. From here, the host will seat you. It wasn't that busy, for lunch on a saturday, but then again, it's still new. \n\nNew, clean, featuring memorabilia from the movie, seems a little smaller compared to the other locations, but the ambiance feature is this one is overlooking the popular Strip. There were some patrons outside, but it was too cold for us, plus, our two-month old baby. There were some tables  with chairs and booths (the booth was too small for us- we had a stroller). I can't comment on the bathrooms since I didn't leave the table. \n\nOn to the food, the \"Run Across America Sampler\"- hush puppies, artichoke dip and chips, spicy chicken, fried shrimp, and peel 'n eat shrimp, is our absolute favorite. The price was $15.99, slightly higher than the last time but maybe the prices have gone up since then (last year- Oahu). This one never disappoints- we always split it. My husband really loves the hush puppies, it's his favorite. Mine is probably the chicken. I got the strawberry speckled lemonade at $5.99- refills are 99 cents. (Similar to Red Robin's lemonade.) The Ice Cream Caramel Spice Cake was phenomenal! This was $8.99, but well worth it. We've had the other ones in the past-  the bread pudding, strawberry shortcake, and the cookie sundae, but this one is specific to Las Vegas- it's new. I'm pretty sure we are getting this dessert again. It seems like a seasonal flavor combination, but really, you could have this all-year round. The server was really nice, and the service was pretty good, too. We got to ask the server questions about the movie. The manager stopped by to see how we were doing. He even changed out my wobbly chair. \n\nMy husband thinks that this takes away from when we go out of town, because we always include this place in our must-haves/must-eats, but I really like that it is finally here, where we live. I hope that this place does well. Las Vegas and certain restaurants do not always mesh (except mexican restaurants seem to pop up when space opens up).

Last Saturday, I arrived on the Strip to dine in Bubba Gump. \n\n     I have been to Bubba Gump Shrimp as a tourist in New Orleans and Chicago. I had been waiting for the grand opening of their Las Vegas vacation. Last Saturday the wait was over.\n\n    Bubba Gump Shrimp is located in the new mall that opened up on the northeast corner of Las Vegas Boulevard at Harmon Avenue in the shadow of Planet Hollywood. It is a second level tenant with pedestrian traffic from  two strip pedestrian overpasses. Currently it is easy to find because a lady is advertising it to passersby. At the entrance is the menu. I appreciate it when restaurants have the menu at the entrance. I prefer to have an idea of what I want to order before I step inside a restaurant. Once we decided what to order,entered through the edge of the Bubba Gump Shrimp Gift Shop. The woman greeter nicely directed us upstairs. Once upstairs, we were directed to stand on a cue of circles in a waiting area of the restaurant proper. If you have waited to ride on Disney Land's Star Tour's ride, this is a similar arrangement. Inside the restaurant, there is a spectacular view of the Cosmopolitan. When the weather is nice, the balcony seats overlooking the Cosmopolitan is a prime dining spot. The weather was cool and we sat in the general Forest Gump themed dining area.\n\n   If you have never been to Bubba Gump Shrimp, they have a neat gimmick. On the table is a sign that you flip. If you want service, I believe you set it to \"Stop Forest\" and if you don't need service, I believe you set it to \"Run Forest Run.\" \n\n  If I was in vacation state of mind, I would of spent $21.99 on the Shrimper's Heaven. I was in a budget state of mind. Bubba Gump Shrimp is a reasonable option if you are on a budget on the Strip. I ordered the Shrimp Po' Boy sandwich with fries and bottomless Coke. After a tip, the dinner came to $22. Not bad!\n\n   I have a minor complaint, which is the waitress up selling a restaurant card. When the waitress sat next to us, my instinct was that she was not a die hard Forest Gump fan that wanted to share with the world that Forest Gump played football and that he was from Alabama. When I am eating out, I do not care if Forest Gump was wearing no sneakers in a scene or that football was a sport he played. I want to relax! By the time I am eating I have passed enough people in the hotels trying to sell me time shares. Fast forward to when we were walking out, they were advertising sales at the gift shop. In other respects, the waitresses were friendly and served with an urgency.\n\n   Most likely I will return to Bubba Gump. If I am in a tourist state of mind, I will relive my past vacations with Bubba Gump's Shrimper's Heaven.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 2, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "Let me preface this by saying  I DON'T LIKE SEAFOOD. I wish i was so enamored with it that I could destroy a bucket of shrimp and be happy about it, but I cain't. \n\nI just cain't.\n\nOkay -- now that that's done, I can confidently tell you that the solid 3 stars is only based on the service. The food left a bit to be desired. WIth all of the seafood buffet opportunities, I think that this BG cannot afford mediocrity. \n\nWe were greeted on the first floor by the hostess, who ushered us into the store and up the stairs. There was a short wait, then we were seated. I can imagine this place when it's busy, and I definitely do NOT want to be waiting on the stairs, my man. \n\nOur waitress was entertaining and gregarious. She was also very attentive to our table and got us whatever we needed, which was nice. \n\n\nMy friend had the fish and chips. The chips were good. Not many places can ruin fries - no worries there. But the \"fish?\" Boo. WAAAAAAAAAAAY too much breading, she could barely find the meat!\n\nFun fact: you tell the waitstaff that you need help by flipping over the license plate signs to the RED side. This lets your waiter know that you are ready for service or you have a concern/question. They'll tell you that, \" you're in the drivers' seat.\" \n\nI see what they did there. \n\n\nI got the burger. It was really good, but nothing spectacular. It kept well, but I was not too happy about the price tag. I believe there was only one option for a burger, so I was sour that I felt overcharged to add cheese to the burger. \n\nAnd what is a burger without cheese? WHAT. IS IT?\n\nThe outside seating looked pretty appealing, but it was definitely chilly considering the temperature had dipped down into the 50s. and for the desert during midday, that was a little too CRISPin Glover for me. \n\n\nIf you know you're about to get the chili's rate seafood experience, then you will not be dissapointed.

You never know what you're gonna get.\"\n\nWell, no... actually Forrest Gump said that. MY momma always said, \"For God's sake, Ryan, why can't you put down that Nintendo controller and play outside with the rest of the NORMAL kids? And what the hell are you wearing all that TINFOIL on your head for?\"\n\nNo, Forrest Gump was the one who talked about chocolates, and Bubba always talked about shrimp, hence, we now have the chain of the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. restaurants. They're all over in touristy spots, and the Seestur raves about the one in Anaheim in Gardenwalk. She even sports the sweatshirt proudly. This from a girl who would practically retch if she even got near seafood.\n\nSo boy, howdy, was I excited to see that there was going to be a Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. on the Las Vegas Strip. So excited, that I didn't even care it was located mere steps from the horrifying (to me) Goretorium. I was going to brave the danger and go to Bubba Gump, and if one of the evil scary monsters from Goretorium and/or one of the sleazy porno-card giver-outers on the corner of Harmon and the Strip came after me, well, by God I would buy fresh boxers from the Bubba Gump store.\n\nIf life is like a box of chocolates, I should have tried poking the bottom of the candies before coming here. I got stuck with that one everyone else dodges. You know, the one with the pink cream-ish center that's supposedly cherry or raspberry but tastes more like Pepto Bismol.\n\nLas Vegans hardly need a reason to celebrate but we find them anyway, and as I had just been unceremoniously and hurriedly booted out the door by my former employer, ironically who stood across the street from Harmon Corner and rhymed with \"Bosmopolitan,\" I decided to have a little \"New Beginnings/I Got Fired\" dinner at Bubba Gump's.\n\nFiguring I was the last one there (as I usually am) and not wanting a demon to jump out of the Goretorium and eat my soul, I asked one of the store clerks, \"So... I'm in the store... but where's the restaurant?\" She smiled and directed me up the stairs toward the back of the store. A sign or something would have been nice.\n\nI headed up the stairs, where I was actually first, gathered the party, and we were seated. They explained the license plates on the table that say \"Run, Forrest, Run!\" and \"Stop, Forrest, Stop!\" which I thought was a cute touch.\n\nThe crew was stellar. Our main waitress was super bubbly and thrilled when she heard we were all locals (like, apparently they had not been frequenting the place... what a shock no locals on the Strip). She was very attentive to our needs, to the point where we never really needed our \"Run/Stop\" plates on our table. She even regaled us with ghost stories in nearby mining towns. So despite whatever else I say in this review, the staff was great and should be commended.\n\nAnd with that being said... well... \n\nWe started with a round of drinks. Since it was my firing party, I was ready for something nice and strong, so I went with Bubba's Blue Hawaiian: vodka, rum, gin, Blue Curacao, pineapple juice and Sierra Mist, yes, please, come to DADDY! The menu says $8.99, but don't be fooled! That doesn't include your collectible Bubba Gump glass, so you're more looking at $13. You have to specifically ask to NOT get the collectible glass, whereas I think it should be the other way around. But the drink was pretty good. Not quite an AMF, so it won't belt you on your ass, but not a totally tame drink either.\n\nDinner came around, and I have to say I was gravely disappointed with my dinner.  I got the Shrimper's Heaven, which along with french fries came with Fried Shrimp, \"Chilly Shrimp,\" Coconut Shrimp, and Shrimp Tempura, along with three sauces: Asian, cocktail, and a Cajun sauce that reminded me more of orange marmalade.\n\nI started with the \"Chilly Shrimp,\" which I thought was just going to be cold shrimp like you might find in a shrimp cocktail. No, in fact, that is wrong. \"Chilly Shrimp\" is Bubba Gump's version of \"Peel-n-Eat Shrimp,\" which means the shrimp is cooked inside its shell. Yes, shrimp have shells, and shrimp have legs, which took that portion of the dinner from \"tasty seafood morsel\" to \"creature that used to be alive, probably leaving behind a family he supported and a shrimp company job that will have to do some PR work to explain his disappearance and he was probably named Charles.\" I can't eat things that could probably be named Charles. So there's a quarter of the dinner shot down.\n\nThe rest was tolerable. The coconut shrimp and fried shrimp were kind of dry, but the shrimp tempura was fine.\n\nWhat wasn't fine was the bill: for JUST that and the drink, after gratuity I was paying $55 BY MYSELF. People, I just got fired! Just because I was paid out my vacation pay doesn't mean I need to be spending it all on dinner!

Second, you decorated well, but maybe you should have stayed in Cali. I liked you better there. \nI was super hyped up when I heard the news that my city was getting a Bubba Gump. I have dined at both the Santa Monica and Anaheim locations in the past and always loved it. Fried Chicken, shrimp bloody marys, and cajun shrimp. YUMMMMM!\nMy boyfriend and I waited to go with our friends Mario and Sonya. They were always who we went with in Cali so it just made sense that we check out the new location together. I am in there looking like a tourist. It is set up so you enter through a gift shop, go up stairs and wait for a hostess. It looks just like all the other locations with great Forrest Gump decor. Everyone was super welcoming and friendly. 5 stars for service all around. Again as a tourist I asked to sit on the patio. It was about 9:30pm so the heat was dying down. We ordered a sampler appetizer that came with seafood hush puppies, chicken, fried shrimp, and shrimp cocktail and a pound of cajun shrimp. To me, the cajun shrimp were the highlight of the entire night. \nMario and I ordered the bucket of trash which is a little of everything. Crab, fish, shrimp. It was average. Not amazing but not bad. My boyfriend had fish and chips which he didn't like, and Sonya had fried chicken, which again was average. Disappointed in average fried chicken because I know its above average in Cali. \nNow I understand when going to a seafood restaurant you should expect to pay $20 a plate. Especially on the strip. But oh boy do they rape you on the drinks. $4 sodas and $9 lemonades!?! And they charge for refills?! $160 seemed a little rough for 4 people.

She asked us to think about it and she'd come back. What the heck? Why can't you just bring the check? It seemed like she wanted us to give a definite answer of no before she was willing to print the check. Strike one.\n\nWhen we finally received the check, we attempted to pay with an e-gift card that had $100 loaded on it and our meal was $91 including tax. When she brought the receipt for us to sign, she told us that we couldn't tip with the gift card and that we still had $8 or $9 remaining on the card, awesome...where's the gift card, could we have it back? The server refused and told us it was policy to keep our printed gift cards whether or not there was a remaining balance. WHAT? How does that even make sense? I will never be able to use the remaining balance then! We asked her to make a copy for us but she refused and told us to simply re-print one when we got home...problem is how do you do that when it was a gift and I already deleted the original e-mail?! No other business I've frequented has ever asked to keep a gift card, remaining balance or not without asking first if I wanted it back. She told me this is what her manager told her to do, which didn't really help the situation. I considered not leaving a tip since I just lost 9 bucks but ended up leaving a decent one and decided to take it up with management at a later date since it wasn't her fault and she was just doing what she was instructed to do.\n\nI e-mailed the company about a week later and complained about my remaining balance that was lost because I was unable to get my gift card back and 2 days later received a phone call from one of the managers of the Vegas location. She stated that it was company policy to do this and the server indeed followed protocol. I was really angry and got in a heated argument with the manager about the policy since it doesn't really protect them from anything, while making it super inconvenient for customers and discourages them from buying and using gift cards. It wasn't the 9 bucks that I cared about, but the principle of what was going on that seemed fraudulent to me. I got nowhere with management and she continued to tell me that it was corporate policy. Ok, I guess I'll have to contact them to get more info then.\n\nThen we contacted corporate customer service and was told that this was NOT corporate/company policy in any way, shape or form and that the store was mistaken and they weren't sure why. They ended up sending us a new link to re-print our gift card with the remaining balance and informed us that we would be receiving a phone call apology from the General Manager once they contacted him about the situation.\n\nAll in all, Bubba Gump Las Vegas is run by liars and they did nothing but inconvenience my family and then lie to me about it to back up their side of the story.

The focus is clearly on the chicken, not on batter or breading.\n- The toast was surprisingly good - thick cut, crispy, chewy, and buttery.

It was good, but very messy. The amount of cinnamon and sugar coupled with the fried dough gave it a churro-like flavor.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed it quite a bit.

Everything is made from scratch from family recipes, and this is a family that must eat VERY well. I literally got back from N'awlins on Saturday, where I had gumbo at the prestigious Commander's Palace. Weeziana's gumbo smoked their's out of the swamp water. \n\nI give five stars, however, because everything else was just as good as the gumbo, and the owner/chef couldn't have been more hospitable and lovely. She had cornbread fresh out of the oven that she brought to the table, and it was the best I'd ever had. We also ordered the cornmeal coated corn on the cob, and she comped us some of her delicately fried fish served with a fantastic spicy aioli and Crystal hot sauce. This lady can fry to perfection!\n\nI wanted the bread pudding, but I guess even after 6 weeks the dessert is becoming so popular that she was sold out. I 'settled' for the pound cake. Another item that fit in the category of 'best ever.' \n\nDon't expect much in terms of the atmosphere, but expect tons in terms of everything else. The food, service, and value make this a MUST in my book. I'm grateful it's only ten minutes from home, but even if it weren't I'd drive distances to go here. \n\nDespite the filling meal costing less than $20 for two people, I would give Weeziana's five stars even if it cost twice as much (maybe even three times). \n\nOh, and her son is super cute, too.

I tried the fish, grilled and fried, and I couldn't even say why I tried it. I have never really liked cooked fish.

I've never had a grilled fish fillet before that was this good. The fried fillet was good too, but the grilled was simply out of this world. I spent my whole life thinking I didn't like grilled fish. As a sushi fan I've given grilled fish plenty of chances, and always was disappointed. I've had grilled fish at American Fish and Mastro's, and for $6.50 this was head and shoulders above any other grilled fish I've ever had in my life. It was seriously so unexpectedly good that it makes me feel like I need to evaluate what else I might have been wrong about.\n\nI think this place is still working a lot of kinks out of the system, I can't say I've really enjoyed any of the sides I've gotten, and after my first visit I really could not believe the 5-star reviews of this place.

I read over the other Yelp reviews and was very excited to give it a go, the coupon had some killer deals.\n\nWhen we walked in, we were greeted by the super-friendly staff, Larry the owner, is very personable and they are all very polite.\n\nThe entire restaurant is very clean, including the restrooms. I love that the kitchen is completely open, you can even see into the refrigerator. The way that they have the restaurant divided, you can dine peacefully while the kitchen bustles. All of the food is prepared and cooked fresh so be a little patient, it is well worth it.\n\nThis first round, we came in around 2 o'clock on a quiet Tuesday afternoon, we decided to try a couple of things:\n\nSouthern Double Burger with Fries - the patties were homemade, no frozen meat, sweet onions, juicy and fresh with perfectly fried crinkle cut french fries.\n\nFried Shrimp Po-Boy - succulent, large, golden brown battered shrimp with a butter toasted, soft roll.\n\nGreens - best I've ever had, no bitter aftertaste, perfectly seasoned with a wonderful smokey taste. I added a little hot sauce and they're even better with a little kick.\n\n6 Piece Oysters - perfectly cooked, tender in the middle with just enough batter, great fry batter too, it didn't fall off if you decided to eat your oyster with more than one bite.\n\nRed Beans & Rice - bland but has potential, all of the fresh flavors are there, it just needs a little more time to simmer the beans and some seasonings.\n\nMacaroni & Cheese - needed just a dash of salt and pepper but definitely homemade and delicious.\n\nI'm so happy that they have a self-serve soda and iced tea machine.\n\nThe chef was so nice and happy to hear feedback on his cooking, he even brought us out some spiced yams to try. Honestly, I hate yams and my niece didn't know that they were sweet potatoes. One bite, I was in heaven! They were buttery and warm, the spices were on point. I can honestly say, he made me a yam fan. I will probably never order them anywhere but here, but I'll for sure be having them here when they're on the menu.\n\nWe had such an awesome experience that my niece and I decided to bring my Grandma back for lunch the next day. Again, everyone was amazing and we tried a few new things too:\n\n12 Piece Jumbo Shrimp - these shrimp were cleaned and cooked perfectly, the batter was light enough to taste the fresh shrimp but cooked perfectly that it stayed on after the first bite. The quality is amazing, they bring a whole new definition to \"jumbo\". You don't find good shrimp like this in Vegas.\n\nMashed Potatoes & Gravy - needed just a bit of salt and pepper but I couldn't make them any better myself. I'm a huge fan of chunky mashed potatoes, I don't like them so smooth they can be used as wallpaper paste. They were buttery and delicious. The gravy was perfect, smooth and packed with flavor.\n\nColeslaw - creamy but not too sweet. I'm not a huge coleslaw fan but this is a very good side dish. Being homemade never hurts.\n\n6 Piece Fried Fish - this fish was so moist and the breading was delicious. I ordered way too much, the portion is huge, well worth the money.\n\nFried Oyster Po-Boy - so my niece can't get enough of the fried oysters. She wasn't so sure about them yesterday but they've made a new fan.\n\nAgain, the chef was so nice and happy to hear feedback on his cooking, he brought us each a bowl of his homemade banana pudding with Nilla wafers to try.

None of these adjectives turned out to be an accurate descriptor. In fact, the food at Zoe's kitchen took 30 minutes to come out and was disgustingly bland and in a few cases, quite gross. \n\nWe stopped in for lunch last week. The place was packed, but the line to order moved quickly, so we incorrectly assumed that we would also get our food quickly. More on that in a second. In terms of the menu, we were shocked at how uninteresting the menu options seemed. Even though the menu was decently sized and we are open to lots of different types of food and flavors, we found ourselves completely unable to choose and not drawn to any individual option. \n\nEven though I'm not a vegetarian, I prefer lunch sandwiches with no meat, so I was also quite irritated that the only vegetarian sandwiches were the grilled cheese and grilled feta. This is 2008, and the non-meat options at a lunch spot should be more imaginative than cheese slapped on some bread. In the end, I still ended up ordering the grilled cheese (nothing else sounded good!) and my husband selected the Greek Chicken Marinara. \n\nWe sat down at the table, displayed our number card, and just waited. And waited. And waited. After literally waiting for 25 minutes, I checked in with the assistant manager who was manning the pick-up counter. She went into the kitchen, checked on our order, and said it would be just a \"few more minutes.\" She even had a server bring us two slices of chocolate cake as some sort of  token of their sympathy, but it was super-dry and totally gross. Thanks, but no thanks. I'm just glad we didn't pay $2 for each slice!\n\nIt wasn't until 10 minutes later when I lost my patience and told the same server that we wanted our food immediately that we finally received it. We have a higher-than-average awareness of the difficulties of working in food service, but we found it un-acceptable that a non-full-service restaurant would take 35+ minutes to bring us two sandwiches. If they can't handle the catering, to-go, and eat-in order volume, they should hire more staff members. \n\nAs if the slow service wasn't painful enough, my grilled cheese was completed charred (literally burned and black). After one bit of the accompanying slaw, which was soaked in mayonnaise and soggy, I  immediately walked back to the assistant manager, handed her the plate, and asked her to refund me for my plate. To her credit, she complied, but the wait had already been so egregious that I wasn't about to just write the long wait and gross food off and decide to return. \n\nMy husband's Greek Marinara was not as terrible but was still bland and completely un-memorable. The bread was a plain roll, the chicken breast strips were formed and tasted totally processed, and the \"Greek\" marinara tasted like Prego.

The greek salad that I got as a side was great!! A ton of feta cheese on mine, really clean lettuce. The side of rice was great, too. \n\nI am gluten-free, so I had to pass on the pita bread, but that looked really good, too. \n\nThe food was a little simple for my taste, but not bad. I'm not sure if I would go back, just because of my food preferences, but others may love it. \n\nThey serve you on disposable plates and cups with plastic silverware, so it's a very simple restaurant. \n\nAnother person in my party got a chicken pita, but it looked like it was only a half pita stuffed with chicken. I personally would have wanted two halves, but I guess I eat a lot...\n\nWorth a try once if you like fresh food, pitas, veggies and kabobs. It's a good place to stop in to try something quick and new.\n\nOverall, good, but I prefer the restaurants around the area though- there is a Habit Burger, Five Guys, etc that I would prefer.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "The steak rolls are good but not worth the price", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I used to not go here anymore because the service was so slow. Decided to give it a shot again a few months ago...and the service still makes for 3 and not a 4 star review. I usually stick to the Greek chicken pita which I've had 3-4 times and it's kind of a hit in miss in terms of how good the chicken is cooked. Sometimes absolutely delicious and other times a little dry. A friend suggested I ask for hummus inside the pita (strange I know) but that really does the trick in terms of having a \"good\" pita there and if only they could improve their service speed so you don't have to wait 20 minutes each time they would get a 4. I almost gave them 4 this time around because a manager approached us as we were having dinner and of course noticed that we had to get up twice to ask if our order was almost ready.

I didn't want to give folks a typical sandwich boxed lunch and needed something that would appease carnivores, gluten free folks and vegans alike and I feel like Zoes Kitchen was perfect. Working with their sales manager Marissa made the whole process super easy. Their boxed lunches were great! I went with chicken kabobs, veggie kabobs and chicken green salads and was so impressed with the presentation. Delivery and set up was great! The delivery girls did have a spill and 2 veggie kabobs didnt make it but I appreciated that they were honest about it and I was refunded. Zoes had no problem in individually packaging all 110 of my orders. They even brought along some nifty coolers with ice for drinks and all of the necessary paperware/plasticware. They accommodated to my party's needs (chicken and pita bread on sides for vegetarians/gluten free folks). I had the chicken kabob lunch and it was so good! The chicken was flavorful, the salad was refreshing. I was also very happy that I decided to order some of their cookies because they were such a big hit!

A LOT.  Like, embarrasingly a lot.

I used to have a problem where I'd get home and find chicken added to it (a no-no for a vegetarian like me), but I haven't had that issue in about a year.  Nonetheless, I check it while I'm still there every time to make sure.  The salad is big and tasty (especially without those nasty olives or unnecessary potato salad glob at the bottom), and I feel like it's pretty healthy and low calorie.  The service is nice and pretty efficient, even during weekday lunch rush when it's a real challenge to find parking and maneuver around the lot without getting hit.  They don't even embarrass me about coming so often and ordering the same exact thing, haha.  The one thing I can say as a critique- they could be a bit more consistent on their salads.
