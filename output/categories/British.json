The place is very nice with the smell of their own smokery [pinesmoked venison and pigeon, olala!] They have a very nice yard and blankets to cuddle up in whilst having a smoke or just gaze at the stars. I had pigeon for starters and then the pinesmoked venison that was pure bungey jump, meaning WOW. One can feel that it is a new place and the staff is trying to find their feet in the work but service was great and food was top top. Expensive, of course, but worth it.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "There was much talk of Timberyard before and after it opened in Edinburgh. There are many foodies in Edinburgh, there are many great, nay, wonderous restaurants in the capital. So when a new restaurant opens to a hushed hubub of excitement amongst potential diners, it both has a lot to live up to and a lot of eager customers waiting to try it out.\n\nAnd so, when I walked past the huge, giant, bright red doors on a misty Autumnal afternoon and realised *that* was Timberyard, I immediately went in to have a wee peek, and having done so, booked a table for dinner later that week.\n\nI'd heard that they have their own smoke house, and smoke their meats in house. And that the menu changes seasonally (as is so very in vogue just now). Looking at the menus pinned to the wall, I could see that they were very specialist, sumptuous but not that extensive. Four options for mains. But I did like that there were both 'Bites' and 'Smalls' as starter options. Perfect for having a taste of some of the delicious dishes without ordering just a little too much.\n\nThe restaurant itself does live up to its name - it was literally an old timber yard that has been converted. So think bare white stone walls, a hugely tall ceiling, it's almost cavernous, and it doesn't feel too big or empty or cold. Candles light the restaurant, many many candles. A small couch and rug area where you can wait for your table and enjoy a cocktail make it feel homely. The bar itself allows a drink without the need for a table too. It's fine dining cuisine, but in a laid back, homely and welcoming atmosphere.\n\nThe staff are all incredibly friendly and down-to-earth too. I would agree with Peter S and say that they are perhaps still settling and finding their feet, but I loved that as the waiter was clearing our plates he told us how he'd smoked the pigeon himself earlier that week, and described how he did it. That did make me smile.\n\nAs for the food itself? Well, I don't give 5 stars lightly. The bite options on the menu allowed me to try two different 'starters' -quails egg, and smoked pigeon. The quails egg dish was literally one quails egg, although it was perfectly cooked with a slightly runny yolk. And the pigeon was equally petite but equally delicious.\n\nThe main - the first on the list - venison, with red cabbage, port and parsnip. Simply outstanding. The meat was perfectly cooked - so perfect - and whilst it was a modest portion, in keeping with fine dining size, it was just right. Venison is a rich meat, and any more would have been too much.\n\nOn that note, if you are starving and like big portions, then you might leave a little hungry or having ordered all three courses, paid the price, and still not feel stuffed. But that's the point of fine dining - to enjoy the flavours and leave satisfied but not overly full. Just a fair warning for those who prefer quantity sometimes. (Or not to come after you've run a marathon, say.)\n\nDue to the slightly higher price tag, I won't be returning too soon. There are some places in Edinburgh that do very good food but at a lower price. Not as fine dining as this, but still equally as enjoyable. \u00a317.50 for a main is more than my wallet can allow for my regular meal out. But if there were a special occasoin - family visiting, a date, a celebration - I wouldn't hestitate to recommend or come back to Timberyard.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 4, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "I went to this place for a friends birthday meal.

I was attracted by the setting, the stories of the food, and the fact that they have a little garden out back where they grow some of their greens.  So, we booked up a table weeks in advance (if you want to come at a reasonable time on the weekend, book early .. but having said that we visited just after the Festival so that could well have had something to do with how few tables they had), giving ourselves loads of time to look forward to it.\n\nThe setting didn't disappoint.  It's gorgeously industrial chic (and yeah we were totally getting design ideas for our kitchen).  The primary colours are white and dark brown/grey with splashes of colour from the tartan throws on some of the chairs.  The Man observed that (despite the woodburner in the middle of the room) it must be a nightmare to heat such a large space, so I guess the throws come in handy at times.    \n\nOne of the serving staff explained the courses to us, encouraging us to go for all four courses and saying that they're on the small side.  \nThey have two menus - one that's standard and one considered a \"pre theatre\" type menu that's much more affordable.  Interestingly, we seemed to be able to mix and match across the menus which was lovely because the mains on the pre theatre were almost half the price (\u00a311.50 vs \u00a319.50).\n\nFor our bites, The Man got an oyster while I had the young herb salad with honey and sunflower.  He loved his oyster and wanted more, but I wasn't very taken with my salad.  The herbs were a bit overwhelming in their flavour and could have used some normal lettuce to balance it all out.  The sunflower petals were a gorgeous touch, though.  \n\nFor starters I had the duck egg with spring onion, and The Man had the sardine.  I am super picky with eggs and found mine just *slightly* underdone because the white was a bit gooey for my taste.  That's really just being picky though as the dish as a whole had a gorgeous rich flavour.  The Man loved his sardine.\n\nI had the beech smoked sirloin for my main, while The Man had the lamb.  Again he loved his, finding everything melt in your mouth amazing, while again I really enjoyed mine but felt the sirloin was a bit over cooked to my liking.  It was more medium/medium done than medium rare.  \n\nWe then shared the chocolate pudding which was ridiculously amazing.  Really really ridiculously amazing.  We also got coffees which came with vanilla fudge and little lemon cakes.  \n\nWe found the portion sizes to be fantastic - I always prefer more smaller courses than big plates of food, which allows you to be comfortably full instead of stuffed, and makes for a more leisurely dining experience.  \n\nThe staff were outstanding - perfectly attentive and charming while being both relaxed and professional.  \n\nI originally approached this review prepared to give 4 stars for the small issues I had with the food but when I compare this meal with others I've loved, this easily equals and could possibly top them in quality.  Even The Man, ever a skeptic when it comes to trying a new restaurant, said he would return in a heartbeat.   From the minute you walk through the huge impressive doors, you know you're in for a really unique experience.

So, over 10 minutes later no one had come to take our drink order. We should have just gone to the bar, but we weren't in a hurry so we thought maybe they were busy. Just as was about to give up and go to the bar someone came over and took our drink order, which was one beer and a gin and tonic. Needless to say, it took almost another 10 minutes before our drinks arrived. And no one came back to see if we wanted another round. \n\nI'm sorry, I don't mind waiting if a place is super busy, but they didn't seem to be as I watched the person that took our order chat for a few minutes with a co-worker for a while before they even started making our drinks. \n\nBeing in the service industry, I would just have appreciated some honestly about if they were too busy to do drinks for us or if it would be quicker at the bar.

But it's on the Royal Mile. But it has good reviews on Yelp! But it might be a tourist-sell-out place on the Royal Mile. But it's the only place that's open and we're hungry and it does FOOD.\n\nSo we went to WHISKI Bar & Restaurant. And I'm giving it a solid 4 stars. Yes, it's on the Royal Mile and this usual positioning, along with the Scottish-liqueor name, Scottish-decor, and Scottish-style pub food menu would make you think it might be similar to all the other overly-Scottish pubs on the main tourist street of Edinburgh, and therefore the food would be subpar.\n\nWe were wrong. In fact, WHISKI isn't even OTT in it's decoration. It's just a really nice bar and restaurant. Old wooden furniture, obviously plenty of whiskies on offer which are all chalked up on a huge black board by category (Lowland, Peaty, Malty, Highland etc.)\n\nIt was busy. It was New Years Day. But the floor manager was really friendly and got us seated at a larger table. The only grip is the food. Took. Forever. But I am willing to overlook this as it was New Year's Day, no one wants to be working New Year's Day let alone feeding hungover people, and they were probably short staffed. If I go back and it takes this long there's a problem. \n\nThe food itself, when it came, was delicious. My fishcake (starter) was ma-hoosive and had delicious chunks of smoked salmon and trout. The burger that I got to try was nice, if a little dry, the chips all disappeared quickly, the soup portion was kinda small, but the sausages and mash looked amazing. As far as general gasto-pub fare along a Scottish theme goes, this stuff sas the best on the Royal Mile I'm sure.\n\nAnd they do have a lot of whiskies, and I think will know their stuff. So whether you're a tourist or a local I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed in WHISKI. And as a case-in-note, that's not really how you spell it. And we don't call it Scotch Whisky here.

Now before you get your knickers in a twist, I'm an international student myself and know the difficulties mastering the spoken English language (as opposed to the written) but the guy (who was very sweet) did not really speak at all.

The walls looked like a modern art room, with an elevator that will take you to the top floor. Here, there was a beautiful rooftop view of Edinburgh and the city.

The white button mushrooms I buy from my local supermarket don't really cut the mustard after that delectable truffle with beef I had last night. And now I expect all the custard I consume to release an amazingly aromatic apple-wood smoke. And my Eton Mess to be as neat and tidy as can be. After a mini-tour of 5 courses of the menu, I feel I have been spoiled in the best way possible.\n\nImagine my delight when I was invited to try the mini-tour menu at the new Mark Greenaway restaurant at No 12. Piccardy Place. There has been a lot of hype and buzz about this new restaurant opening in the Edinburgh foodie community, and as a bona fide foodie I had been biiding my time.\n\nSet in No. 12 Piccardy Place, which also has a cocktail bar, secret garden and other areas, it has a retro, swish but not stuffy feel. I love the white, plastic, nouveau stags head in the reception area with the plush couch. And not least the incredibly friendly, down-to-earth and attentive staff. Huge appreciation for Nicola, the M'aitre D, and the waiter who recited every dish's full name and ingredients for us.\n\nI was lucky enough to try the five-course mini-tour menu which was a taster of 2 starters, 2 mains and 1 dessert off the main menu. I have had to refer back to the menu on their website to recite these, and I want to make sure I get them just right so you can appreicate, through these tasty pixels, just how decadent the feast was:\n\n- Amuse Bouche of Potato and Truffle\n- Loch Fyne crab canneloni, with smoked cauliflower custard, lemon pearls, beetroot mayo\n- Confit of Gressingham Duck leg, served in a beetroot carpaccio, hot orange jelly, raspberry dressing\n- Skate wing sous-vide, beetroot pur\u00e9e, olive mash, crispy squid\n- Roasted and poched fillets of beef, braised beef shin potato gratin with truffles and mushroom\n- Mark's Eton Mess \n\n(Photos but all of the skate dish are uploaded, I think I got too excited and ate it before I could snap.)\n\nMy particular favourites were the duck terrine and the skate wing. Duck terrine can often be very fatty and pat\u00e9-esque, but this was mainly pure duck meat wrapped in a beetroot carpaccio, with some delicious warm orange jelly. Orange and duck is always a winning combination but it was really nice to try something new with the combination, rather than just an orange sauce or the actual fruit.\n\nThe skate was just tender deliciousness. I've never had skate and am now a fan - delicious, tender, meaty fish. And the olive mash, which plentiful, was my favourite side on all the dishes.\n\nThe first starter of crab wrapped in raviolli served over a warm glass bowl of apple-wood smoked cauliflower custard was certainly the most eye-catching, and sensory dish, of them all. I'm not a huge fan of very creamy things and there was certainly a lot of creamy custard. But the effect of lifting the top dish releasing the waft of apple-wood smoke was quite magical. After we'd had ours, throughout the rest of the evening we could faintly smell when someone else had just opened up theirs. Very good fun, tongue-and-cheek presentation for beautifully cooked food.\n\nIt was a grand treat to be able to try 5 different courses off the menu, and I do look forward to returning to have a full serving of a main. The beef with mushrooms and truffle was just divine. Oh my goodness I could eat truffles every day.\n\nThis is definitely somewhere to come for a very nice meal, that is a treat or a special occasion. I noticed the fixed price two courses for \u00a316 Market Menu which looked like really good value and a fantastic way to try some of the finer food in the city.\n\nUnless your tastebuds are a bit wack, I can't imagine anyone turning their nose up at the culinary feast at Mark Greenaway. Quite the opposite - our whole table dived into the mini fish-bowl of custard to appreicate that apple-wood smoke as best we could.

You can't deny that fine dining is often accompanied by a certain air, slightly subdued and more civilised than the local gastro-pub. Yes this is warranted, as people sit in hushed awe at the delightful dishes they are about to enjoy. But sometimes this can drift more towards an arts-for-arts sake approach to dining. I adore good food. I love an excuse to sip a cool crisp Chardonnay and linger over a 4 hour meal with amuse bouche, petit fours, coffee, then whisky. I also do like to be a little fancy. But I don't want to feel uncomfortable and that I need to 'fit in'.\n\nMark Greenaway is a wonderful restaurant that has the hushed tones and calm atmosphere of the more sophsiticated diners but is so approachable, genuinely warm and friendly, and the menu accesible that it pretty much ticks all my boxes.\n\nThe menu is quite wonderful. I dined here most recently with the Yelp Eats menu, which was a prix fixe menu. Even with the more limited menu I was already spoiled for choice. Pork Belly or Skate Wing? Belly or Wing? I ended up going for the Langoustine Broth with Caviar for a starter, and Skate Wing Sous Vide with olive mash and squid as my main.\n\nOur party were first treated to the Amuse Bouche. A small mouthful of creamy heaven to whet our appetite. The thing I love about the food here, apart from how happy it makes my taste buds, is the sensory treat it provides. My broth arrived as a large bowl of foamed broth with some caviar peeking out the top. After delving in I found one large raviollo on a bed of spinach with the langoustines inside. Creative presentation, that has more than a little fun to it, but still as delicious as any.\n\nThe Skate Wing I had already tried at my previous taster tour menu. At my last meal it'd been a moderate portion, as I was eating three other mains. However, I didn't quite expect to receive such a generous portion this time around - but that is certainly no complaint.\n\nHave a look at my uploaded photo. The most tender, juicy piece of skate wing rolled up served with the most light olive mash (far lighter and cleaner on the palate than a tapenade), and some teasingly delicious bits of fried squid. Despite that both my plates were fish, and quite light, I was hugely satisfied and very well fed. \n\nWhilst none of us went for dessert, imagine my joy at being presented with some beautiful platters of petit fours. As Kevin L described one as '1000 calorie ants on a log\", very tongue in cheek, but there was one particularly dense, rich, heady dark chocolate truffle that I had a tiny bit of...then went back to finish that, and another, it was too good. And that little bite of white chocolate that turned out to be lemon meringue pie in chocolate form. Oh my. It is a good thing there was only one within my reach!\n\nThe dinner lasted for 4 1/2 hours and at no point did we feel it had stretched on. The atmosphere at Mark Greenaway invites you to luxuriate in your surroundings, take your time over your meal, and enjoy good conversation in beautiful surroundings.\n\nWords cannot do it justice. The food is just out of this world and a cut above the rest. This is somewhere I will come for a special occasion, but also perhaps for a mid-week treat meal.

I've been meaning to try his fine dining for a while now, after reading so many good reviews and this was the perfect opportunity to sample some of his fine dining at an affordable price.\nWe had booked a table for 7.30 pm and when we arrived, the lovely lady at the reception took us to our table, which was a nice corner table. We were quite surprised that the restaurant was so quiet, but I guess it is mid term holiday this week, and it was a Tuesday.  I have to admit that I felt a bit self conscious as we were the only ones in the room but our hostess was lovely and chatty.\nWe ordered our food and as we had both opted for the pork as a main and were a bit uncertain about the wine, we were recommended a reasonably priced Pinot Grigio. \nAfter a very short wait, we were brought a delicious pea and mint amuse-bouche.  I love when restaurants do that.  It's very common in France but you only seem to get it in fine dining places in Scotland. That was certainly a lovely start to the meal.\nFor starter, G had gone for the terrine and after hesitating all day between the cullen skink and the ravioli, I opted for the ravioli.  I do love cullen skink but this was too good an opportunity not to try that delicious sounding dish! Both starter plates looked very pretty and were a pleasure to the palate.\nThe main course then arrived.  I had been looking forward to that slow cooked pork all day and it certainly looked as pretty as it tasted!  The crackling is just soooo good with a little bit of salt. Divine! Now, I did say on twitter that I would have liked the texture of cooked apple with it, but that's probably just because I'm French!  The dish is fantastic and the puree and the jus were very delicate and delicious.  \nOur waitress was very attentive and the service was quick. We were offered pudding but didn't opt for it as we were feeling full and were left to finish our bottle of wine.\nI haven't mentioned that the restaurant is nicely and tastefully decorated, the lighting is quite low, which make a pleasant and intimate atmosphere, and I did like the background music, which was jazzy enough to create an atmosphere but not overpowering at all.\nI can't wait to go back, and will happily save some pennies to be able to afford the normal price!\nAlso, I haven't found out how to add pictures to a review but I have posted the pictures to the restaurant's profile so everybody can admire the faultless presentation.\nHats off Mr Greenaway, and thank you for partnering with Yelp!", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 4, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "Seriously blown away by the quality of the dishes!

But there are places where you do have to just doff your cap in admiration - and Mark Greenaway is one of them. This restaurant is a 5 star... and more. \n\nGiven my reluctance to try out restaurants which may break my monthly salary, Yelp Eats was the perfect introduction to MG. The quality of food, service and overall dining experience was simply superb. The service was flawless. The plateware was gorgeous, as were the wine glasses. The dining room itself muted and understated in a modern/trad style. Loved the music. I hadn't even reached the food at this point. \n\nFirst up: an amuse bouche of pea and mint *frothy soup* (sorry, I can't remember the more refined term for this...spuma?) which, if I am honest, was the best part of the meal and made me sorely regret that I didn't opt for the pea and mint risotto for my main. It definitely was a tastebud tickler. \n\nThis was followed by a graciously selected slice of white rustic bread (I love good bread, so had to note it's attendence) and delivery of the mixed seafood raviolo in a langoustine broth with avruga caviar. Frankly just saying that adds a few notches to my culinary repetoire, let alone the opportunity to eat it. The presentation in a lidded deep dish added a lovely element of surprise, digging through langoustine-infused foam to reach the surprisingly large raviolo nesting on wilted greens below. The flavour of the raviolo was perhaps a little too delicate for my tastes, but the broth was lovely. \n\nFor the main, I chose, based on Jenny l.'s enthusiastic description, the skate wing, and foresaking my previous intent on the risotto. Lets be honest here, if I had had it my way, I would have had both, but sometimes life doesn't play that way. I wasn't a super fan of the beetroot puree, but the skate-wing simply dissolved away during consumption, and the olive mash was equally melt in the mouth,. The squid, which can be touch and go for me, was one of the last items on the plate along with the mash - which for me means it was the best. The beetroot crisps were an odd but pleasant sensation - wafer, melting and not what I think of when I think of beetroot. \n\nMy mum also had the ham hough, which she tucked into with gusto. Both my parents had the 11 hr slow cooked pork which was reportedly delicious and non-greasy. The spiced fillet accompaniment was also a hit. \n\nI have to make note as well of the presentation - each dish presented was a work of art. A feast for the eyes, the nose, the mouth. In the end, we opted to pay extra for a dessert, and to make this meal last a little longer. To the table, 2 dishes of bramley apple 6 ways and one cheese plate. The apple sorbet was a revelation and a new found love. Apple crisps and puree were a lovely contrast in flavour, but the jelly was instantly forgettable for both myself and my mother. My dad enjoyed the cheeses, although the goats cheese delivered a kick worthy of a hind leg. \n\nOverall, with the wine and dessert, we spent far more than what the Yelp Eats menu offered, but oh, what a way to go. And now, I know, MG is worth every single penny you spend there. It was an absolute treat to go there and essentially dry run the restaurant on a budget I could afford.

And Jenny....... THANK YOU!!!\n \nThis is by far the best restaurant I have been to, so far. The menu may read a little up-market and I did worry that I may stick out like a sore thumb, but not at all. The service was spot on, professional, but not to the point that they won't be friendly and have a wee laugh with you, which is just what I am after. I do not want to be served by a robot who has no intention of interacting with you in any way, that ain't my style. Then, oh, then there was the food. Presentation is impeccable! Not a single thing out of place on any plate! We both had the seafood raviolo...... delish, and not too filling. I then had the skate, with the olive mash which I was a little unsure of, olives and me, we are rare acquaintances, we do not get on. But in this case, we got on like a house on fire, the flavour complimented the skate perfectly and I devoured the whole plate. My friend had the pork belly which he ranted on about for the rest of the weekend, so I figure he enjoyed it.\n\nAnd last, but by no means least...... my weakness, dessert. The chocolate fondant was calling out to me, there was no way I could not have it. I think had I not that would have been a severe mistake, I loved every mouthful of it, I could eat it every night. So I would say if you go here, have the puddings, they are more than likely to be the best part of the meal! The portions as expected are not what you would get in a hearty rustic pub, it is QUALITY over quantity, but I left feeling satisfied and grinning from ear to ear and not with that horrible stuffed feeling you sometimes get - and I had 3 courses!!

Although the menu was different to the main one, it still certainly looked good.\nWe arrived just before our table booking time and were shown straight to our table. The restaurant was pretty quiet, we were the only ones in our part of the restaurant, I think this was probably due to it being mid week and school holidays. Anyway I digress! The place is stunning, although I think it would be a bit more comfortable with a few more people in.\n\nWe looked at the menu, but in reality have both pretty much chosen in advance. I ordered the 'Ham Hough and Shallot Terrine' starter, and '11 Hour Slow Roasted Pork Belly' main. \n\nGiven that I haven't a clue about wine we asked the restaurant manageress (not a clue if this is the right title!) to advise us. Given that this is a very fancy place, this worried me! I needn't have been, we got a really nice bottle of white which didn't break the bank (\u00a321 I think). \n\nFirst to come out was a pea and mint puree amuse bouche (I only just learnt the name). A pleasant surprise before our starter. It was nice, not my favourite part of the meal, but certainly did it's job in preparing us for the starter.\n\nThis was followed shortly by some nice warm bread, and then our starters.\nVisually it was great. Yet surprisingly for 'fine dining' it was fairly substantial too. It came with red wine jelly, roasted hazelnuts and hazelnut mayo. \nThe hazelnut and terrine was a great combination of flavours. My only suggestion would be for more of the actual hazelnuts, or for the mayo to be more strongly flavoured.\n\nOnto the main....\nAgain arriving promptly the main looked just as good. As well as the belly pork there was sliced pork fillet, pomme puree (a nice creamy mashed potato for the common of us), savoy cabbage, and cubes of toffied apple. \nThe pork fillet was really tender and tasty, mash was really smooth (but not too much). The real winner (and my favourite bit of the meal by far) was the slow roasted pork belly. I've not seen such a uniform piece of belly pork (a perfect square with immaculate crackling), but this attention certainly didn't take away from it's substance. It was very much 'melt in the mouth' stuff! The only thing it was lacking in my opinion was salt to bring the flavour out. However unlike a lot of people, I prefer it this way so it can be added to taste. The flaked salt  (so much better than other types!) provided did the job perfectly.\n\nSo that was that then. A great deal from Yelp, but I'd certainly go back to try the full menu sometime. The staff were great; professional yet friendly and happy to chat unlike some other high end restaurants. \n\nI've given 4 stars. I did consider 5 but I'm always reluctant to do this even at the best of times. I have no particular reason for not giving 5, but I think there's always room to improve (is there such thing as perfection).\n\nOk, enough of my long-winded nonsense.

A firm favourite drinkery of mine, so I assumed their class and quality would reflect in the attached restaurant.\n\nIn short: My expectations were met.\n\nFor starters I opted for the Ham Hou-- \n\nBut wait! What's this? This cheeky green concoction?\n\nBefore our starters were delivered, the waitress surprised our table with a complimentary aperitif of amuse bouche of warm pea mousse with truffle oil.\n\nFantastic! But wait (again)! Did you say peas?? I hate peas!\n\nUnless, it appears, they are done like this...! I'll admit, I supped on the pea mousse out of politeness and I did not expect to like it as much as I did.

In a word: terrific. And an impressively attractive dish.\n\nNext up, and the reason I couldn't wait to come to Greenaway's, I had the 11 Hour Slow Roasted Clash Farm Belly Pork with Pomme Puree, Savoy Cabbage and Toffee Apple Jus.

I was hardly going to say no!?\n\nThe first visit with the yelpers was amazing. Crab cannelloni with smoked cauliflower custard. I was in awe when it came out, presentation is spot on, as was the taste of course!! Lifting off that little cone on top to be greeting by the most scrummy smokey smell, brilliant.

Just very thoughtful and the flavors were perfect. For appetizers Debra got the Loch Crab Cannelloni and I ordered the Hom Ham tureen with Scallop. The crab was wrapped in a paper thin crepe on a small bed of greens suspended over sauce infused with beets all in a cone shaped glass that fit into a narrow throated glass bowl. The  bowl contained yet another sauce at the bottom and filing the rest of the bowl was a fog of smoke from hardwood. The two glasses were separated and the smoke released exciting the senses.  Each component was  tasted individually before mixing into what Debra described as the most luscious crab she has ever had. There were so many components that it was hard to make them all out. However, the result was a merging of flavors that was unique and in a class by itself. The tureen was also spectacular , packed with succulent ham in a flavorful gelatin where hints of coriander, clove, mustard and garlic seemed to be present. It was topped with a perfectly cooked medium sized scallop with small cubes of jelly for accompaniment . I honestly cannot identify what those cubes were made from but that didn't stop me from using a bit with each bite. Fabulous!\nMain courses did not disappoint. Debra's pork belly was soooo scrumptious she said not a word to me during that course except to make some sounds of joy after each bite.

This was followed by the 12 hour slow-roasted pork belly with a toffee-apple jus..... WOW!! The crackling was just amazing and the pork so tender and juicy and accompanied by the most amazing tasting and textured creamy mash potato - I'm sure it probably had a better description on the menu but I can say that my tastebuds were on overdrive!

It's beautifully and creatively presented (the applewood smoke with the crab cannelloni was sooooo cool) but indeed also incredibly good.  In addition, it's the perfect size so as to not leave you stuffed after the starter, and to leave you perfectly satisfied after two courses and comfortably full after three.  \n\nThe timing of the courses was also ideal.  I often find that within minutes of my starter being taken away, my main appears, giving me no time to digest a bit and have a chat.  I've gotten used to that and plan to spend maybe an hour and a half when I'm out for a meal, and that's with coffee.  Not so at Mark Greenaway.  We luxuriated for over three and a half hours over an amuse bouche, three courses and coffee.  \n\nThe wine list was excellent - not too much, not too little, and with a wonderful range in pricing.  \n\nThe staff were attentive, incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, and just generally lovely.\n\nThe pricing of the food is what really topped the experience.  For such fancy food of excellent quality, the prices were incredibly reasonable.  I don't recall seeing any mains in the \u00a330 range and the most expensive starter was \u00a310.  Pair this with set menus for 2 or 3 courses (for \u00a316.50 and \u00a320, respectively) and you really have a steal.\n\nI was expecting Mark Greenaway to be good but I had no idea it would be this good.

The food is creative, upscale, and luxurious.  I was fortunate enough to be invited to a special meal hosted by the sponsors of this excellent website to celebrate the fall menu.\n\nI had a wonderfully creative starter: smoked scottish salmon, homemade black pudding on tiny tattie scone, and poached quail egg on foie gras (eat your heart out SF!).  The dish was soft and luscious, with dark and smoky notes.  Sadly it was under seasoned, spoiling pure enjoyment.  Overall the perfect execution of each of the elements more than made up for this transgression. \n\nMy main was an 11 hour smoked pork belly, served with the most velvety canelle of mashed potato, a lovely cabbage slaw, and a few slices of juicy pork loin.  The plate was kissed with a toffee sauce that was pure sweet and salty heaven.  The belly itself was absolutely perfect, soft fat sandwiched between smoked meat and crispy cracklin.  I would have loved a bit more sauce (actually I would have downed a glass of it if offered), and maybe more cabbage or another vegetable on the plate might have helped cut the richness of the meat and mash.  Despite these suggestions the dish itself was a meat-lovers triumph, and I can see why it is one of Mark's signature dishes.\n\nDesert was a celebration of chocolate so rich it might have defeated a lesser man.  Luckily I was up to the challenge (ok maybe the wee dram of Caol Ila fortified me a bit).  The presentation was stunning (true of all the dishes really), with a perfectly cooked fondant cake balanced by layered white chocolate mousse wrapped in a delicate chocolate.  Orange caviar rounded out the plate.  The cake was rich, dark, and sinful, perfect 70% cocoa simplicity.  I don't normally like white chocolate, but the mousse was soft and tangy, perfect to cut the richness of the chocolate.  The orange caviar was clever, but could have been integrated better into the dish.\n\nOverall an incredible meal, amazingly progressed and well presented.  The quality of ingredients and care in preparation make it easy to overlook the minor flaws in execution.  I will most assuredly be back to see what else Mark has to offer.

Firstly Taste was flooded out, I missed Foodies as I was in the US and then third time unlucky - the news was that Mark was launching a new menu. I was determined to have pork belly cooked by the man himself before it disappeared so I reconfigured my schedule to include a visit pre, instead of post, work trip.\n\nWhat an experience - OMG. It was amazing and everything and more it should be. This is fine dining and everything is just perfect. Gorgeous location and fantastic service. As part of a twitter offer, we received a free glass of champagne, even though we were ordering off the Market Menu (3 courses, \u00a320), it magically appeared at the table without being requested. Service was attentive without being obtrusive.\n\nAnd now for the food - sheer bliss! I'm gluten free and usually this can result in little unhappy faces throughout the meal as more disappears from the plate than appears on it. Not an issue here and dishes could be adapted to suit dietary requirements.\n\nGluten free bread was provided - a gf brown and seeded version which was lovely and crispy (and its a nice touch so you feel less 'special needs' and more special). \n\nSo to start: Ham Hock, with scallop and pea puree, apple meringues and edible flowers. Lovely. The main flavour of the ham hock came through, complimented but not over powered by the other flavours and the scallop was cooked to perfection. \n\nFor mains, it had to be the Pork Belly with savoy cabbage, pomme puree, apple and toffee apple jus. It was to die for. Seriously. I was almost Meg Ryan in the sandwich shop in When Harry Met Sally. It was just THAT good. I am fat phobic when it comes to meat and I hate more fat than meat but this was a perfectly meaty piece of pork belly, with the crispiest crackling - not too salty but with a lovely light sweetness. 12 hours of sheer cooking artistry. It was divine and I was as happy as the piece of piggy on my plate probably would have been in the dirt.\n\nHowever, I came for 3 courses and I was having 3 courses. Being gluten free, I did worry that I couldn't have the salted caramel and peanut cheesecake with warmed chocolate sauce, but not at all. A modified version, minus the non gf base was provided (pistachios were instead of the base) and the dessert was simply divine - lots of lovely nutty sweetness and not so sweet it was sickly.

I couldn't get enough of the warmed chocolate sauce and had to refrain myself from doing 'the finger scoop' of getting the last remaining bits of chocolate sauce from the little jug.\n\nA pot of tea sounded like a lovely way to finish off the meal and given the decadence of all that passed before then it was a solid 'oh go on then' when offered the Petit Four's. Now being gf we knew that some petit fours would be off the menu for us and we got gorgeous chocolate truffles instead - nah, nah, nah, nah, nah!

Chocolate and coconut and white chocolate and gooey lemon centre (don't try to bite the white choc ones in half as it will be messy) - they were so good!\n\nFood was simply stunning and ranks as my best meal - nudging out the simple and now closed, legendary Rome restaurant visited a decade ago.

Our waiting staff were friendly, attentive and had the right balance of being highly professional, but completely approachable. The restaurant itself is beautifully designed with a clever mix of classic and contemporary, and provided a perfect venue for a memorable meal.\n\nHowever, as Ms Woolf quite rightly points out, the dining is the most important part of the happiness experience, and blimey were we happy.  Every single dish was admired, gushed over and appreciated fully before we even lifted our forks and knives.\n\nFor me, it was a starter of Hand-Dived Orkney Sea Scallops which were prepared perfectly and served on a pomme fondant. Tender, sweet and wonderfully balanced with tomato jelly and parsley mayonnaise. I have never savoured a dish so much...until my main course! Pan Roasted Hake fillet was next with purple mash, lobster tortellini and pumpkin. It was delicate, and so fresh I suspect it leaped straight out of the sea onto my plate. The combination of flavours was sublime, the dish was beautifully presented and my plate was spotless at the end.\n\nDuring my meal I had a couple of glasses of a tasty Sauvignon Blanc, which went well with my seafood starter and main course and, at \u00a35 a glass, was excellent value.\n\nTo end, I choose a Chocolate Fondant with a vanilla tuile, white chocolate mousse and tonka bean ice cream. This was again presented with such elegance, and was absolutely delicious. Every element combined well and the dish had the right balance of hot & cold, sweet (but not overly!) with the rich cocoa working well with orange caviar.\n\nEverything was relaxed, each dish was served at just the right time and the conversations flowed.

But, it's a new menu, and I think it needs to get of it's training wheels. Flavours-wise don't feel quite together yet. Presentation, as always, flawless. Service struggled with a table of 18, but was pleasant throughout, but time between courses was quite long, but I put that down to the sheer effort in presentation, however glasses were rarely empty (although my other half did observe as he didn't drink wine, he wasn't offered anything else to drink bar water). I came away with the same satisfied feeling as before and did have a fabulous evening, but perhaps with less wow involved. \n\nSo apart from time, the amuse bouche - celeriac (yum) and the flavour in the espuma packed a punch, but not quite sure red amaranth and a very surprisingly solid hazelnut matched in either flavour or texture. \n\nStarter: crab cannelloni and smoked cauliflower custard. Presentation was... just .... awesome. An inspirational dish. But... it was so cold there were ice crystals inside the cannelloni (which with the spinach butter acting as the pasta, it made sense to be so cold) which I didn't particularly enjoy. The display of releasing the applewood smoke and the flavours in the smoked cauliflower custard was fantastic and surpassed the cannelloni itself. \n\nFor my main, I went for the hake. I will note, which I hadn't noticed on my previous visit, that there is a major lack of vegetarian meals - starter, yes, but not main course, which I do find curious. In that manner, I am of course, biased. The hake was beautifully cooked, and I do recommend that the broth is added, it was delicious. The purple potato mash was the best item on the plate (with a nod to Bodger and Badger, I do love me some mashed potato) - the flavour in the potato were beautifully captured. I did notice that mashed potato was a popular theme in the dishes around me as well. Again, I am mesmerised by the detail in the dish in front of me. \n\nFinally, as I couldn't really say no (similar to last time really) to desert and this time, went for the broken lemon tart. That was a fun looking dish! It reminded my (looks-wise, not flavour) of Bassetts Liquorice Allsorts. The lemon tart pieces were fab, and shortbread base, packed full of buttery goodness. I *think* there was a lemon ice cream - that didn't really stand out for me, flavours were too close to the tart to be discernible - and coconut jelly, which to be honest, had attracted me to the dish in the first place - but it was utterly lacking in flavour - definitely felt like a dud. A week on though, the sharpness of the lemon tart sticks more in my mind. And I am not thinking about the fact I ate jelly for the first time in a long time (veggie no no, I am a bad girl as i didn't check for gelatine). \n\nAnyway, overall, if you went to MG for a beautifully presented meal, which is executed flawlessly, you won't be sorry.

The staff in here are the best at their job, from setting tables, to offering drinks, to the waitress who brought our courses to us and explained how each course was made and how Mark suggests you eat it. Our orders were taken, our wine was poured, and Colin and I immediately began chatting about our love for the place. \n\nOur aperitifs were brought out; with a beautiful shallot amuse bouche, which were thoroughly enjoyed.

Oh God, you think you've tasted good crab before, but you've not until you've been here. The way Mark makes it it's in 2 different parts of the dish, and thought most people would eat from the top of a dish to the bottom, Mark suggests you try both simultaneously. I did, and I enjoyed. Thoroughly! \n\nOur wonderful waiting staff cleared the table, before our main courses were brought to the table. Colin had the pan roasted hake fillet, with a lobster tortellini, purple mash, fennel and dill puree and pumpkin, and I ordered the 11 hour slow roasted pork belly, with spiced fillet, pomme puree, savoy cabbage and toffee apple jus.

Once seated you soon see that Mark and his team have been able to recreate the wonderful ambiance the had at Piccardy Place. To the menu and from the \u00e0 la carte it was good to see he has kept the favourites while also introducing something new to lift the menu further.\n\n\nOnce we had ordered, the sommelier Loic who we have gotten to know was kind enough to show us his new wine vault, with this having been an RBS the original vault in the basement remains. Given how little time they have has to prepare its amazing how much they have achieved. The wood work and the style they have given this room is really impressive. Loic explained that they intend to further develop the vault and diner will be able to select their wines with an illustrated world map on the wall providing further details.

The flavour of the lamb was just incredible, the seasoning brought out the taste as much as Amy producer could hope for.\n\n\nTo finish I decided to revisit a favourite of mine the broken citrus tarte. This dish simply put is a work of art in appearance and just as tasty. The zing of the parfait is beautifully matched by the coconut, watermelon cubes clean the palate and the pistachio pur\u00e9e adds another dimension when combined. After dinner Loic was also kind enough to take me back to the vault and give me a sample of the most incredible muscat I have ever tasted, larger quantities will be required when my dry January has finished.\n\nAll in all the meal was superb, Stephs parents were delighted and then even more so when they had a good ten minute chat with the man himself Mr Greenaway. Mark is such a friendly guy and willingness to chat to customers at the end of a service does him great credit. With the excitement that has surrounded this opening I can say the product more than lives up the hype. Undoubtedly they have a lot of work to do but with Marks inventive cooking and the team he has around him I am confident this new venture will be a massive success.\n\nRestaurant Mark Greenaway comes highly JD Recommended!", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 3, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "i've been having a serious debate as to how to write this review.  when looking at the rest of the reviews before i went to dinner at mark greenaway, i knew it was going to be good but was the hype going to be better than the actual dinner.  i had been both looking forward to dinner at mark greenaway and also a bit worried.  it seems that when i go some place yelpers rave about i seem to leave a little disheartened as my experience wasn't rave worthy.  but that said mark greenaway was amazing!  the food was just wow!!!  it was beautiful on the plate and beautiful to taste!!\n\ni started my meal with the red wine and radicchio risotto with a poached hens egg in the middle.  the risotto was creamy and packed fun of taste but breaking open the egg and mixing in the runny yolk made this dish even more fabulous.  i almost wish i'd ordered the larger portion just to have had extra risotto to mix the yolk with!!  for main i had the pan fried hake topped with a lobster tortellini, side of purple mash, and spring onion and ginger broth.  oh and there was delicious cubes of pumpkin as well!!!  the hake was cooked beautifully and just flaked apart.  the purple mash was divine, so creamy and a lovely shade of purple.  but the best part of this dish was the single lobster tortellini that sat atop the hake.  i saved this for last and was not disappointed.  biting into it there was loads of lobster soaked in a lemony sauce and it was just divine.  if only i could have had a whole plate of these!!\n\ni went a bit untraditional for the dessert and had the cheese platter.  as much as i love dessert, when i'm out fine dining i always go for the cheese as it's just too good to resist!  i was quite pleased that i had five different cheeses to try, all a very large slice, with some frozen grapes, quince paste, and some poppy seed thins and oatcakes.  the cheese was lovely and i really enjoyed this while everyone else had their sweet desserts.  to finish i opted for a peppermint tea which came with a lovely assortment of petit fours!  the brownies were mmmmmmmmmm!!  i thought it was a nice touch as i still got a small sweet for after my meal and they came at no extra cost.\n\nso yes the food was lovely, so excuse me while i make this a bit longer and explain why it was 4 stars and not 5.  mark greenaway is aimed at fine dining standards and i felt that this fell a bit short.  i know that they only had 10 days to do the refurb and open the restaurant but this showed as the place feel short of the decor perfection that is required of this type of restaurant.  it was nice, but just felt like it was rushed.  then there was the music... ugh this actually really irritated me.  it was loud and didn't seem to have a common theme and i felt like it really intruded on the atmosphere.  i'm not sure if this was due to the fact that we were the only diners in the restaurant and i wouldn't have noticed the music had the place had a bit more buzz to it.  they also seemed to have a wee bit of stocking issues as we ordered two bottles of red for the table and when someone asked for another glass when the bottles had been finished the sommiler had to tell her that they actually didn't have anymore.  i found this odd as a restaurant of this standard just shouldn't run out of a type of red wine after only two bottles.  \n\ni think for me, mark greenaway is on a journey.  they've only just re-opened at a new premises and while the food is still divine the restuarant is not quite there yet.  my hope is to go back in six months and see it completely settled in and i can update my review with 5 stars.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 6, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Since my previous two reviews of Restaurant Mark Greenaway, it has moved location to it's own, independent premise, the menu has been updated slightly with  new options for me to debate over when choosing, but the quality of dining - both in ambiance, and the food itself - has remained as high as ever.\n\nThe new space is stunning. The building used to be a bank, and so has the beautiful cornicing and old-world feel. For some reason, it feels slightly Parisian to me. It could be the dark wood and green-velvet chairs contrasted with the sharp, steel feature on the wall. Or the etched glass lampshades that are clustered on 3 chandeliers in the middle of the room, giving a soft yellow light, to the dark blue and grey walls. Compared to the previous venue, this one is so much more fresh (it looks beautiful in the day too, perfect for lunch) and still intimate. I do think when it comes to fine dining, the restaurant space and ambience makes a big difference, and the new space really earns 5 stars itself as the perfect dining room for Mark's cuisine.\n\nBefore I move onto the food, I must make mention of one new part of the Mark Greenaway dining experience. A complimentary wine tasting in the new wine cellar (housed in the old money vault, the building used to be a bank) with Loic, the in-house sommalier. We were taken downstairs to taste 2 reds and 2 whites, both very different; and recommended which mains to choose for which wine (or vice versa, depending on your priorities). Given we tasted 4 wines before even a slice of bread, it made us all very merry and excited for the meal ahead. The tastings are generous, Loic is enchanting and so enthusiastic about both the wine and food. It made an already complete dining experience exceptional, and stand out from others I've had before. This in itself makes the meal a very special one.\n\nAs to the food itself? How could it be anything less than 5 stars. The Market Menu remains exceptional value, and is offered in the evening as well. I opted for choices from the main menu however, as I wanted lamb.\n\nA starter of Cured Stonebass with Pickled Langoustines and Crispy Squid. The Langoustines were wonderfully different. They had the texture of a regular langoustine, but had the delicious sweetness from the pickling. And Stonebass is a fish I haven't knowingly tried, but cured in citrus (as I imagine ceviche is) it was perfect with the contrasting crispy squid.\n\nThen the lamb. Oh the lamb. Wrack of lamb, with a tasting of neck of lamb and lamb belly. Lamb belly! How have I never tried lamb belly before? So much fatty goodness, it was more flavour per square milimetre of food than I have ever tasted. Cooked to perfection. \n\nIt's probably worth noting that the mains don't come with many vegetables, which I quite like, but if you do like greens then order a side. But honestly, the dishes work perfectly as they are themselves.\n\nAnd then the desserts. Our table of 11 Yelpers were brought to a hushed silence when the combination of Cheese Platters, Peanut Butter Cheesecakes, and Broken Chocolate Tarts were brought to the table (and one Plum Jam Jar). I believe Mark Greenaway has experience as a pastry chef, and it shows. We all agreed the desserts stole the show. They were made with so much love, craft and care. Even if you're not a \"sweets\" person I urge you to get a dessert. \n\nAs they often come 'deconstructed' or broken, you don't quite know what each component is going to be till you try it. Oh, that's orange sauce! And oh pistachio! Ah, and the little circular chocolate discs are the biscuit base, whilst the knot is a pure ganache. Heavenly. Plates were scraped clean, then scraped twice to be doubly sure.\n\nAnd then, the little plates of petit fours were the perfect way to round up a meal. It was a CMYE (Yelp social dinner) where 11 Yelpers had had three courses each, and yet we still politely eyed up the millionare shortbread and chocolate truffle petit fours. \n\nI really couldn't fault the meal, food, service at all. From the wine tasting in the cellar before dinner, the way in which the food is presented, the friendly staff, the beautiful decorations. Mark Greenaway remains one of my favourite restaurants in Edinburgh, and I can't wait to go back.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 5, "cool": 4}}, {"text": "Mark Greenaway first caught my eye on tv show The Great British Menu last year when he was competing to cook an Olympic banquet; serving up creations I'd never heard of or seen before. So when Yelp announced it was having dinner at Mark Greenaway last month, I jumped at the chance having missed out on two opportunities previously and hearing so many good things about it and wondering if he really would love up to the standard displayed on tv.\n\nWhen I arrived I was greeted by a handsome well-suited young man who took my coat and showed me to my seat. I immediately liked the place and appreciated the mood created by the decor, colour of paintwork, lighting and music. \n\nWe were treated to a wine tasting downstairs in what was the former bank's vault but is now the wine cellar. After six generous samples from which we could choose one to accompany our meal and learning a bit about each we giggled our way back upstairs and even got lost on the way (there are a few doors). What an excellent way to start off a dinner!\n\nI opted for the Market Menu - 3 courses for \u00a320 and phenomenal value for money it was! To start, we were presented with a lovely cute aperitif which I wasn't expecting. At this point I was rather merry from the wine tasting and wolfed it down without paying attention to what it was(sorry) but it was goooood and that is the main thing! \n\nMy chosen starter was Scottish Mushroom Veloute - Roasted Scottish Mushrooms, Tarragon, Truffle and Raviolo. When it was placed in front of me, to begin with all I could see was sliced mushroom topped with 1 ravioli in the middle of a very large dish and then I saw everyone elses significantly bigger alternative starters, I thought I had been had but then came my pouring sauce. So I discovered that Veloute means soup (new thing learnt for the day, done!) and this was a wonderfully delicious, satisfying mushroom soup with a twist.\n\nFor my main I opted for 11 Hour Slow Roasted Clash Farm Belly - Pomme Pur\u00e9e, Savoy Cabbage, Toffee Apple Jus: a-m-a-z-i-n-g! It was beautifully presented and the combination of flavours complimented each other superbly. \n\nDessert for me was Broken Chocolate Tart - Custard Jelly, Frozen Cookies, Cr\u00e8me Fraiche Parfait, Salted Caramel and kumquat Pur\u00e9e and this blew me away. Each chocolatey thing was of a different shape, size, flavour and texture; accompanied by fruity flavoured purees and popping candy - wow! On my first bite I rolled all the way back in my seat and savoured every single mouthful with a loving tenderness I have never given to food before and I was sorry to see it gone, hoping more would appear on my plate. This for me was a work of art.  \n\nWow! This was a sensory experience I could never have imagined and unlike anything I have had before. The staff were so attentive to every detail, with brilliant knowledge - remembering every ingredient on the plate and making suggestions for how the dish could be eaten as recommended by chef. Also one noticed I had taken photos of my food and asked if I wanted her to wait whilst I took more before setting down additional plates. If I had been on my own in this restaurant I probably would have got carried away and photographed my dishes from a lot more angles - 'work it, work it baby'.

Not only had Mark featured on Great British Menu last month but it was my first visit to the new site on North Castle Street apart from a quick chat with the infamous chef previously and a fab meal at the last place.\n\nIt seemed such a long time and long wait with baited breath since Mark announced his plans to move from Picardy Place to an unknown location, in what seemed a very exciting move for a chef who seems to be going from strength to strength in the Edinburgh food scene.\n\nAs always on enetering Loic the sommelier extroidinaire greeted us warmly amd seated us at the table which was elegantly laid out by the lovely Georgian windows. The Restaurant is located in what used to be a bank and retains many of the original features including a vault! More on that later. The restaurant is decorated in subtle colours with an amazing chandelier that gives a romantic glow when the sun goes down.\n\nWe all decided to go with the A La Carte Menu as it was a celebration. Dishes tasted included expertly seasoned Scallops, wood pidgeon and a ham hock terrine - all devoured.

That said, once I was sat at the table, you actually were quite a way from the next table.  It just needs a bit more thought on interior design for first impressions.  A new carpet (or one vacuumed!) on the staircase to the bathrooms wouldn't go a miss! :-)\n\nAnyhoo.. onto food and drink.  I tried a sample of Pinot Noir & then couldn't have it as no bottles in stock...  offered another option, but was advised it was 50p a glass more.  Now, I have no issue with that, but surely if you run out of stock and thats my only other option, you really wouldn't bother charging a first time customer, a poultry 50 pence more!\n\nWe all opted for the Market Menu (2 courses) at \u00a316.50 each. (\u00a320 for 3).  Great value, but I didn't feel the choices were mind blowing particularly.  Choice of three dishes and vegetarian option was a porridge..hmm.  I don't like salmon, so my only choice was belly pork.  I'm on a new health kick, so belly pork wasn't ideal!  I did ask if we could substitute main course from a la carte menu & pay the surplus - No was the firm answer.  Frankly, that doesn't make sense, as it would have only resulted in us paying the restaurant \u00a330/40 more...\n\nService from waiters was excellent.

However, the pork underneath, as well cooked and tender as it was, really didn't have any individual taste of its own.  Quite bland had it not been for the toffee sauce, mash & the crackling.\n\nPeanut butter brittle cheesecake was a work of art & extremely tasty - the saving course of the meal.  \n\nBill came to \u00a382 (minus tip) for 3 people, 3 wines, 2 soft drinks and 3 teas on top of the 2 courses.  You can't really argue with that - fantastic value.  Had I dined from the A La Carte, I would have expected much more wow for my buck.

Unfortunately I found that the move to N Castle Terrace resulted in a downgrade in surroundings as well as food.  \n\nWhen eating at a restaurant that is aiming for a Michelin star, you don't expect the wait staff to wear dirty uniforms that are missing buttons, and you don't expect the stairwell to the toilets to be scuffed and dirty.  Once you get to the bottom of the scruffy stairs, you are in a cold, dank corridor that leads you to toilets that were \"upgraded\" by painting the tiles black.  Tiles + paint + time = scratches and general shabbiness.  So far, nothing particularly rang of \"fine dining.\"\n\nThis wouldn't be an issue if the standard of food was what I remembered.

It all looked so good! \n\nThe starter was North African aubergine on a flatbread with an egg salad. There was a delicious but overpowering garlic and herb dressing - so good, but I was a little nervous directing comments to anyone who hadn't partaken in the dish themselves. From there, I decided to fly against the common choice of coley and puy lentils (so jealous when I saw it being served up, massive fillets anda solid helping of lentils... what more can you ask for? Unless you went for the short ribs and were given the bone of a teenage cow) and went instead for the thai rice cakes in coconut milk. The cocnut milk was a thai curry style, with massive pieces of lemongrass and lime leaves floating through it. Definitely a good winter warmer! However, I felt the rice cakes themselves were rather bland - strange (not unappealing) consistency of breadcrumbed chewy rice and herb patties - and definitely didn't contribute anything to the otherwise colourful dish. \n\nThe restaurant itself is casual, and heaving.

And just as well. That bad boy of a Coley fillet was EPIC. Have a look at my uploaded photo. I wish I'd used a coin to show the scale. The Godfather of Coley fillets. In fact I think 5 of us ordered it and there was a quick guessing game of whose was the biggest (Kerrin said mine, I said Emily's.) All of them were huge, and I have to say mine was deliciously cooked. Grilled with a lovely lemony flavour,but still melt in the mouth and so filling. The lentils were quite a simple accompaniment but anything more would have out-done the star of the plate.\n\nThe baked apple pudding was again simple and rustic but tasted like Christmas.

People definitely make a point of coming here.\n\nStarving, I opted for a starter and a main.  That, and I saw the option for black pudding, chorizo and bean stew and thought it sounded fantastic.  \nUnfortunately, I was disappointed.  It was served up very plainly without even a garnish, and while the taste was fine, it wasn't any more than fine.  The black pudding wasn't whole as I'd pictured it but was fully incorporated into the stew so they could well have missed it out and, with so many other rich flavours, you wouldn't even know.  I normally love a chorizo and bean stew, but this particular combo was just a bit too salty and far too rich for my taste in a starter.  \n\nI chose the coley and lentils as my main (which, by the way came some 40 minutes after we finished our starters, which came out like a flash... very strange and inconsistant).  The coley was very generous and was cooked and seasoned well.  By \"generous\" I mean that the portion was massive.

On my second trip, the same issue I had taken from my first, was repeated once more. Service remains good, even when the restaurant is busy, but other parts of the business disappoint. \n\nThis time, we returned for the Scottish Menu, in celebration of St Andrews Day. The starter was a collection of treats including marag gheal (white pudding), venison (or vegetarian) haggis, cullen skink and grilled mussels with (scottish) cheddar. All in all, I thought the starter was a hit, with the highlight being the cullen skink. Everything was well flavoured and delicious. \n\nFor our mains, the boy had the beef and oyster pie. Turns out it was a singular oyster. For me, I had the kale and crowdie bridie - in effect, a cheese and kale pasty, delivered on a mustard sauce - the sauce was seriously mustardy and unpleasant - and given the bridie sat on said sauce, not much escaping it. \n\nOn the side, clapshot (swede and potato mash), burnt onions and stovies (lamb and potato). Obviously no lamb and potato for the dining vegetarian, and no replacement either, which I felt a little cheated over - after all, I still paid for my uneaten portion of stovies. \n\nIt's a small gripe, but extends a little further - the menu was printed without really paying attention to the vegetarians amongst us - the starter section didn't indicate it was a collection of starters (the boy only wanted soup... but did enjoy the overall selection) and didn't indicate any vegetarian alternatives. The mains, well to be honest, a pasty is a pasty, and I could have bought very similar out of a bakery for a fraction of the cost. The sides - well, I had clapshot and the onions, which was more of a garnish than anything else. The boy's pie looked very lonely, and his skirlie untouched (oats with added bacon in this case). Lamb stovies went down a little better. \n\nAnother gripe I have is timing. While I appreciate starters and mains appear to be freshly prepared, it takes a long time, especially on a busy night. The wait between starter and main reached painful proportions - I don't believe it shold take that long - but it felt that perhaps preparation didn't start til after we had finished our first course. \n\nThe medley of desserts - I didn't really feel there was much to say - echlefechan tart crust was rock hard, with flavours not to my taste; cranachan was pleasant enough. Clootie dumpling and sherry trifle - I just don't like either, and First Coast's version didn't convince me to change my mind. \n\nSo overall, I think First Coast has less promise than I hoped, downgraded as a result.

Usually dodging around the persistent small gathering of tourists gathered around the Greyfriar's Bobby statue. I imagine this bar often gets a lot of passing trade from said tourists, and locals alike.\n\nThe bar has recently been renovated inside, and the result is a very homely, traditional Scottish pub feel inside. It reminded me immediately of the local village Smiddy pub that my family took me to every Sunday for lunch or dinner (the type that did pate,  steak sandwiches, death-by-chocolate cake. That was my order for a good 12 years). Anyway, I digress. What I mean is, it's homely, it's inviting and not only is it homely, it feels like home. A magic wee trick, where it will both appeal to tourists looking for something very Scottish-y but isn't OTT or a faux-Scottish feel, and instead recreates the cosy Scottish pubs of old.\n\nThere is a very large dining area, for a bar. The bar area itself is quite small and I can imagine would get crowded if many people tried to stay here all at once. So I can imagine they'll be looking more for families for dinner, and larger groups, than a large group of mates all meeting for a pint. But that's just fine. \n\nThe food menu itself is extensive, and I was immediately intrigued by a Crabbie's Ginger Ale glaze on the chicken.

We found parking easily, but I can see how the parking lot could fill up fast. There is no hostess station, it's more of a seat yourself establishment.

Our waitress was quick to stop by for drink orders. When she brought us waters, we were ready to order food. The Scottsdale location has some new appetizers that the Tempe location doesn't, so we decided to try something new the Parliament Wings. My husband ordered the lamb and mint pasty and I ordered a bowl of soup - my favorite being the cream of leak with potato and Stilton. Our wings were quick to arrive and were tasty. Not the best wings I've ever had, but still good. The soup and pasty arrived as we were just finishing up the wings. They were delicious and tasted just how we expected. (I would highly recommend the soup - especially if you like Stilton or any blue cheese. It is tangy and smooth. It also comes with some house made bread which is scrumptious.) It was a very good meal and definitely lived up to the high expectations we had. \n\nOur second visit was for lunch. We decided to try the Cornish Meatballs (another new appetizer) and ordered a pasty to split. The meatballs were different but good. The meatballs are wrapped in bacon and come in a small cauldron like pot which has croutons, saut\u00e9ed onions, and a tangy mustard-like sauce. Again, our pasty was delicious.

Usually, enjoyment of pasties is highly selective to the individual: however, Cornish Pasty Co. offers a massive selection of options friendly to anyone. The difficulty is: finding the right one for your taste. Here is a rundown of the ones I've tried: \n\nBangers and Mash: Pros-hearty, heavy, gravy-filled meaty goodness. Cons- overloaded with \"mash\" (mashed potatoes). \n\nChicken Tikka Masala: Pros- a great one to try for those tired of the meat-overload. Great spicy/mild flavor profile. Cons- sauce is a bit sweet, chunks fall out while eating.\n\nThe Royale with Cheese: Pros- my personal favorite pasty of all time. Meaty, cheesy, buttery, sweet, savory, EVERYTHING IN ONE. Make sure to get medium with bbq sauce. Cons- too much potato. Kept me asking, \"where's the beef?\"\n\nCajun Chicken: Pros- if you want meat, this one's the way to go. Overload of nothing but spice-rubbed ham, chicken, and bacon. Cons- not a ton of taste, a bit too much meat for my tastes (and that's hard to do). A bit of red/green pepper, broccoli, or other lighter veggie really would've helped.\n\nFor dessert, we went with sticky toffee pudding and B-something pie. Both tasty, nothing amazing. Good way to top off the meaty, buttery meal. The staff was terrific, portions were MASSIVE (), great ambience. Seemed to be aiming for a British pub/eatery style, making it really enjoyable for a hungry party!

And my friends, it is indeed Monstrous.\n\nChosen as \"their pick\" in my Lonely Planet Europe on a Shoestring guide book, Monster Mash is a no-nonsense diner with basic decor and simple but hearty food.  I have been here 4 times since arriving in Edinburgh and I plan on many more visits in the coming months. \"Happy days are here again\" is advertised on their front window with a black and white photo of a 1950s couple about to indulge in bangers and mash. And boy do they offer bangers and mash! You can pick from three types of mashed potatoes, gravy and sausage from the menu, but they also offer daily specials which always include vegetarian options. The first time I visited I had the chicken and ham pie with chips. The saucy chicken and ham was hidden beneath a hot air balloon of puffy pastry and was just what I needed on my first day in Edinburgh. A few days later I went back to try the bangers and mash. I decided to try one of the daily specials and had the beef, tomato & basil sausage, accompanied by their classic Monster mash but with green spring onions and a nob of butter topped off with the onion gravy - caramelised onions mixed with a beef and red wine stock. It came to me as a pillow of potatoes (the best I've ever had after homemade) with my sausage (you can choose 1 or 2) resting on top, with my own boat of gravy on the side. Oh how I could not wait to dive into this!! It's easy to resist dessert on a full stomach (and believe me, it's going to happen) but MM has so many amazing desserts to choose from you've just GOT to try one of them! I've tried the Apple Crumble, which was terrific with the warm custard, but the sticky toffee pudding was the winner at the table. My mum liked it so much she was tempted to ask for the recipe! I've also shared the chocolate fudge brownie sundae, which came with a ton of whipped cream on top (my favourite part) and what I can only describe as crunchy brownie pieces- like a soft cookie, buried underneath the whip and perfect vanilla ice cream.\n\nIt's fun to mix and match (weird terminology) the sausages, mash and gravy but the menu offers so many delicious options that it's sometimes hard to choose! I'm determined to try every item on the menu by the time I leave, and guess what? I've already had the haggis, neeps and tatties checked off!

It has the joys of hearty pub food that you know isn't overpriced and cooked up in a microwave with comfortable, diner like surroundings and friendly service. \n\nThe food on offer is not going to help your waistline but it is well worth the treat.  The menu boasts a vast array of sausages, burgers, pies and haggis, proper comfort food that you know is going to fill you up and leave you feeling more than satisfied. Also make sure to look out for the special sausage of the day, there is often an interesting flavour or two there. Combine that with the different choices of mash (nothing like a good Champ mash!) and whatever gravy takes your pick. Now gravy lovers take note! Your gravy comes in your own special gravy boat, to my boyfriend who would quite happily bath in gravy this is a great treat. \n\nI have tried and loved the haggis, sausages, fish and chips and steak pie (jeez, have I really eaten there that many times?). The mash is always delicious as is the gravy, and the portions are huge. Don't go in and say \"only two sausages? What kind of place is this?\" (as most of the males I have visited with have commented) as I guarantee you will be fit to burst afterwards. If your still hungry and can manage dessert, I recommend the Apple Crumble or go for an old school Chocolate Milkshake.

With a crackling radio humming in the background,much of the kitchen in plain view and a cosy gathering of intimate, chipped formica tables that give you the sensation you're leaning, cafe's like Monster Mash have become charming since there aren't enough of them these days.\n\nThere is an element of nostalgia as you are lovingly served up a massive pile of steaming mash and taters, and the attentive waiters are always on hand to make sure you are suitably well fed. It's very down to earth and the menu is kept short and very sweet, so you won't be bamboozled by fancy options. \n\nIt's the kind of place you can turn up in jeans to unabashedly stuff your face. In fact, the caring bunch at Monster Mash encourage you to leave your finest attire on the coat hanger, your feigned etiquette at the door, and just to come as you are.

My personal favourite would have to be the smoked pork and bacon one, but if it that doesn't appeal to you there were about 30 different types to choose from.

(They do have some other mains, the haggis seemed a popular choice our particular day, but the sausages and mash are the primary stars.) \n\nThe good news is in the staggering amount of choice for said stars... I had a hard time trying to decide what to get, eventually going with the Mexican Hot (yum!) and a Pork, Garlic, and Thyme Sausage atop of a Mushroom and Garlic Mash with Caramelised Onion Gravy.  The Mexican Hot was excellent, definitely on my list to order again if it happens to be available... the Pork, Garlic, and Thyme Sausage was actually quite good, but probably the most like sausages I've had elsewhere... if you've ever gotten a Tesco Finest Pork & XYZ sausage, it was along those lines... no fault to them however, I really should have realised this from the name to be honest.  A friend of mine got the Beef and Guinness Sausage which was excellent and left me a smidge jealous. (Food envy is definitely a real thing!)  The mash was as described and quite good as well... I personally will work my way through another type next time, but out of curiosity as much as anything else. \n\nThe service was friendly, but just a tad slower than I would have liked... not slow enough to be called bad however, and when you were being attended to it was very personal and friendly which I adore. \n\nThe place itself works for what it is and eerily reminded me of somewhere you would find in Little Five Points, Atlanta... that's certainly not a bad thing, but it had made me wished I had dressed a bit cooler that particular day as each of the other customers pretty much looked like they could have been in a band and shamefully I was sans waistcoat this particular day. \n\nThey only have a few beers on tap, but the two choices we partook in that day were winners for us... one being the Thistly Cross Whisky Cider, which really caught the three of us off guard in how good it was, with the other being a Tempest Red Rye beer which was also extremely good, both complimenting the meals nicely. \n\nWe didn't have desserts, but what went by did look extremely good and despite not being able to have them (blasted lactose!), I really liked that they had milkshakes on the menu. \n\nOne of the best bits about this place to me is that the prices match the food... you're not going to pay an arm and a leg to eat here despite the \"cool\" factor. \n\nAs a last note for those that this applies to... they actually had several veggie sausages on offer as well, some of which seeming as adventurous in composure as their meaty counterparts, so don't be scared to stop in here with your meat hungry friends.

I knew it was a few minutes after 10pm and the place was \"closed\" but I pleaded with the hostess to let us in for a quick pizza to no avail.  So, after walking a few steps, we found ourselves at The Rose and Crown which to our surprise was still serving food.

It was a real random mix of people there but they were all friendly.\n\nAnyway, we ordered up a few pints and a bunch of artery clogging bar food.  We were also lucky enough to score a nice table in one of the rooms.  And in regard to one of the Yelp posts on here, no, they still have not found the remote to the giant fan in that room.  It was so friggin hot and that fan would have been amazing.\n\nWe ordered some fries, chicken wings, and potato skins and everything was 'eh.  I didn't think it was very good bar food.

As any beer advocate can attest, you don't want a hot glass for your beer (or an ice cold one for that matter, unless of course you are drinking a lager, but I digress.) My wife ordered the french onion soup, and I the Fish and Chips, since no Pub is Worth its weight in ale if it can't produce adequate Fish and Chips; for it is a Brit Pub staple and I judge all Pubs by their Fish and Chips. \nAfter what seemed like an eternity, our food arrived, and it was definitely not worth the wait. My wife took once sip of her soup and said \"this is Lipton's instant soup mix.\" She called the waitress and asked if it was \"Lipton's french soup mix\" and the waitress replied with \"I don't know.\" My wife requested that she ask the chef, and the waitress returned and confirmed that it was indeed \"Lipton's French Soup Mix.\" We requested that it be taken off our bill. \nNow for the real dagger in my foodie heart. I looked at my \"Fish and Chips\" only to find a burned brown piece of batter, dripping of stale deep fryer oil, and potato wedges. Not English chips, potato wedges, like the frozen wedges one can buy at the store. I attempted to take a bite of the fish, and oil dripped down my hand and arm, and a pool of rancid oil filled my plate. The fish batter was burnt and tasteless, and somewhere inside it was a piece of fish (I didn't bother looking for it). I called the waitress back and expressed my grievances of its lack of authenticity as well as its burned and greasy state. Her response? \"Well, it is deep fried\" she said in a sarcastic tone. I explained that I understood that, but deep frying to the point that oil is dripping down my arms and pooling on my plate is not acceptable, not to mention by the smell that the oil was in dire need of changing. I then asked if the owner was British, because I could not fathom any Brit allowing such culinary atrocities.  Her response was again, in a dull sarcastic tone, \"No, but the owner's Mother-in-law is.\" She later returned to apologize and stated that the low quality was due to lack of business.

She was slow, rolled her eyes at bringing us water (sorry it's a freaking 100 degrees outside), and obviously just wanted to go home. \nTo add to this not so awesome experience we sit on the bench of the table and it breaks.

This pub is utilizing an old old house, so people who do not understand the layout may miss the point when entering it. Its supposed to be quaint and small, that's the small part of how great R&C is. I love the ambiance and the atmosphere is great. I have come at varying times throughout the day: From at night when they are having trivia to before/after ball games. Each time, we have been kindly greeted and quickly sat. The servers are all great, they treat you well and are very helpful. \n\n~Fud~\nI will start with complaints, because they are not big deals. The food is great, although a bit pricey. You expect that, with it being downtown.   Considering the portion sizes, some dishes (primarily fish and chips) are over-priced. That's understandable, its fish, but you get so little of something SO GOOD! I do want to point out that most prices are fair and fit well with the sizes of the meals assigned to them. Also, some beers are a bit warm, someone else pointed that out in a previous review. Its not too warm, I have had much much warmer beer, and it seems to be a non-issue, I do not have it happen to me a lot. Once again just a few times, so its nothing to really note of, especially when they have an excellent selection of beers. That being said, they have a great selection by the way, many euro-style brews to choose from with varying textures as well as a typical full-bar. But the food is excellent, and should not be missed at all! Although pricey, it tastes great and is worth it. I can trust only about 4-5 places out here with preparing and making me fish and chips, which here is done perfect for an English pub. They take seafood seriously, as their chowder soup is amazing as well... Overall great food experience despite some minor issues to nag over. No place is perfect.\n\n~Extras~\nThey are a stone's throw away from BOB (or Chase Field, for you Arizona Transplants). It is an awesome spot to go to prior to the game, and a bit cheaper considering prices inside. Heritage Square in general is awesome along with the Science Center, so keep in mind you can hang around that area for a while if you'd like. It is not exactly the best place for children, minus during the day time and a quick trip for a bite before the Science Center.

The Rose and Crown serves the egg elegantly sliced into eights (for sharing, perhaps). And it comes with a pickled relish which is hard to describe... but tasty. The other food item I'ved sampled here and that I can recommend are the Pub Wings. They are a decent pile of meaty buffalo style wings with a pretty good vinegar \"bite\". When this hot mound winds up in your face (and should you be so fortunate... but enough about your personal life), sniff carefully. All too many times I've made the rookie mistake of inhaling whilst sniffing and then lapsing into the inevitable \"wing cough\" from accidental aspiration of the vinegary wing sauce vapor . I once had an order of wings here that were tangy enough to evoke the wing cough from the table behind me.\n\nI consider the Rose and Crown a great downtown Phoenix landing pad from which to appreciate fine beer and pub culture.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I had the cheese fries last week and I can't stop thinking about them.

The menu is the same as Sheep's Heid however as Salisbury houses a larger kitchen, it has the advantage of including the Heid's more popular specials as part of their regular menu, also allowing them three times the daily specials the Heid can manage. Three times as many!\n\nThe building intself is a sturdy old townhouse built of bricks, muscle and brawn.

The night itself was wonderful, everyone brought so much Christmas spirit, and largely due to the lovely Yelpers who came I had a wonderful evening.\n\nI do have mixed feelings on The Salisbury Arms generally though. I really want to like it, and I'm going to come back to try it again when it's not a large table of 30 dining from a fixed Festive menu. But I fear that the large table and repetitive menu didn't show them in their best light.\n\nThe venue itself is beautiful, the perfect setting for a warm, wintery dinner. A fire, big couches, tall ceilings, antlers on the wall. Very nice, couldn't fault it really.\n\nWe had one waitress who was very, very lovely and trying her darndest to make sure we were happy. The table wasn't read when we arrived as she thought it was 7.30pm, not 7pm. No biggie. We're all happy to mill with drinks.\n\nHowever, my one real negative point is this. I pre-ordered 2 glasses of mulled wine for each Yelper as a Festive treat. It was on the pre-order menu, so I duly put down the quantity and all was ok'd when I handed in the pre-order sheet 2 weeks before and paid the deposit.\n\nAfter the Starters arrived I realised there was no mulled wine. When I enquired I was told that they had none. Oh. But isn't that the point of a preorder? I was then told by the Manager that they've never had Mulled Wine on the menu. Ever. THey've never served it, so why did I order it? Because it was on the pre-order sheet. Oh, that's odd. That's a mistake. THey have mulled cider instead. Oh great can we have that? No, because we've run out. Oh..... Awkward pause. Well it's they're mistake that they included an option on the pre-order sheet that they never had to serve in the first place, so they comp'd us a glass of champagne each. Fair dos.\n\nThey did resolve the issue on the night, yes, but only when i chased it up. What gets me is they didn't check the pre-order sheet before the meal (when they had it for 2 week before) and call me to say they had made a mistake. They didn't even tel me on the night when they knew they didn't have any, or take me aside to explain. They just didn't say anything that was fully their mistake. So it was resolved, yes, but I was made to feel foolish when really I had followed instructions exactly. As an events organiser, managing a table of 30 people with different food intolerances, allergies, requirements, and getting the order exactly right isn't the easiest (although I do love seeing everyone so happy!) So things like this really do get to me as it makes it so much harder for me, and I know it would have been easy to resolve with a check of the pre-order sheet and a phone call.\n\nAnyway, rant over. It really bugged me. But regardless, we still had a lovely meal. The food was 50/50 at points. The turkey came wrapped in bacon (YES!) but was a little dry (boo). The brie starter was epically big (YES!) but the desserts all tasted bought-in and the Yule log tasted dry, and was the tiniest slice I've ever seen. I would have cut myself a bigger slice from a Cadbury's shop-bought Yule log and enjoyed it more.\n\nI will go back to the Salisbury Arms to try their food when it's less busy, less hectic. However, I do hope they might improve their communication between staff and work out their large booking, pre-order system a little better. It's basic logic. Why take a pre-order if you don't then check it and ensure everything is in place?\n\nSo yey for the Yelp Christmas Dinner!

Teddywedgers is the last store on State Street before the Capitol, but we never stopped in those nights since it was usually closed.  It wasn't until my freshman year at UW that I was introduced to the best pasty I have ever had.  My friend had been doing landscaping at a bank on the Square and had gone for lunch.

On several occasions I've driven down and there are a few metered parking spots along West Mifflin, so if you're lucky you can park and be back to the car within a couple of minutes, avoiding the fees for the ramps.  The owner, Myles, usually leaves a bit before noon, and it is always a treat to talk to him when he's in.  I've also gotten whole pasties to go.

There are good bottled ciders and also Crabbies.  But the jewel in the crown is that as soon as they heard Sailor Jerry was taking the Vanilla out of its rum they bought up a load of the old style bottles so it's one of the only places in Edinburgh to get the good Sailor Jerry before it turned rubbish.

Definitely not Tex-Mex, but still tasty and better than I had expected.\n\nThe other reviewers were spot on with the music played here.

And this is for good reason. The food is excellent. This was the second lunch here for my wife and me. Our first time we had just walked in, and had to wait a bit for a table. This time we took the wisdom to phone ahead for a reservation. \n\nAs you'll read in many of the reviews, The Outsider is a modern restaurant with chic interior and great views of the castle and the Old Town. This contrast in decor and the historical surroundings gives you a feeling almost as if you have travelled from a medieval city into a cosmopolitan restaurant of the future. However, while many of the 'restaurants' within a stone's throw of the castle serve up steak pie, balmoral chicken and fish and chips (all of which I love at the appropriate time), The Outsider focuses more on a Renaissance of the taste buds rather than traditional Scottish fare. \n\nThe wife and I have been highly attracted to the lunch menu prices. A meal and a drink for two would only just push you over the \u00a320 mark. In fact, without drinks, you can eat for just under \u00a315, even with a starter. And when you compare that to other restaurants considered to be more affordable at lunch time, then I think I'll pay a 1 or 2 quid more and have a much better meal. \n\nEach time we have been here the restaurant has 3 specials served 12-7pm added onto the regular lunch menu served 12-5pm. My philosophy is that if one of the specials appears rather appealing, then I'll have that and try a regular menu choice later. I did that again this time and  the duck special with Parmesan mash potatoes, purple broccoli and black pudding, drizzled in a very tasty sort of creamy raspberry sauce. It was really good. If I was a better writer I would describe it in bigger words ;) \n\nWhile I would say that the food and decor were excellent, I was slightly less impressed with the service, and I do mean ever so slightly. The staff are very friendly, don't get me wrong. The two times I have been here we have had servers who spoke fluent english, but, however, they had problems explaining what things were on the menu. In fact our most recent server had to go ask what some of the items were on the regular menu. I feel like any staff at a restaurant should be able to describe and explain exactly what a dish is and what is in it. \n\nIf you're planning an afternoon in Edinburgh, then you should definitely stop here for lunch, especially instead of any of the other well spoken of restaurants even on the same street.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 4, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "What a lovely restaurant recommended by our B&B.

I had all but given up when I saw my friend run out of her car, so followed her into a pedestrian quadrant where the Birdcage sat. \n\nIt's a very modern bar and restaurant, serving pretty modern dishes that are really rather unheard of in this town. Balsamic roasted beetroot with goats cheese and rocket salad? How on earth does that fit in with the local chippy? I don't think it does, but really, honestly and truly not a bad thing. Sadly, said salad didn't have the flavour I was expecting, the beetroot and rocket both overpowered by the cheese, and the vinegar didn't carry over any flavour at all, so I was a little disappointed, although overall it was a pleasant salad. \n\nMy main was a gnocchi (home made by the looks of it) with wild mushroom, drizzled with truffle oil. A little greasy for my liking, but I find mushroom dishes to be generally more greasy, so you can take that comment with a pinch of salt. My friend's angus burger and chips looked fabulous, and meaty (both chips and burger). \n\nWe both went all out with dessert - chocolate fondant for her, and sticky toffee pudding for me. Not something I normally order, but damn, the flavours were outstanding, with toffee and cinammon screaming out. Sponge itself was a little dry. \n\nSo you can probably see why this is a 3.5 star. Although the food was good, it wasn't amazing or hit the level of sophistication that this place is striving for. However, I don't want Birdcage to fail - perhaps, as it hasn't been open too long, it just needs to stretch its wings out a little more and will improve in time. I think that now that I have the option of old mans pub or trendy bar in my hometown as well, that I will be definitely back to drink some more here too, beats a bus ride into Edinburgh on a dark wintery night.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Another hidden gem - you would not know it was there!

As it happens, Purslane is just around the corner from my work and has caught my eye all too often without action.  Time to pay a visit!\n\nLocated on St. Stephen Street, Purslane proudly sources around 80% of its produce from the surrounding Stockbridge area.  Not only does this bring a community feel to the restaurant but also allows the excellent produce from the likes of George Bower the butcher, George Armstrong the fishmonger and I.J Mellis to feature on its menu. \n\nThe restaurant is small, there's no beating around the bush about that, but it's small with a certain charm and romance to it and is tastefully decorated too.\n\nOur server was very relaxed and chatty and as we placed our order, it was obvious he really enjoyed his job.\n\nWe were presented with an amuse bouch\u00e9 of crispy chicken and Asian noodle salad.  The aroma of roast chicken invited you to dive straight in, where you were greeted by this excellent nugget of chicken and accompanying salad that was fresh and crunchy and had a pleasant hint of aniseed to it.\n\nFor starter, I went for sole and salmon roulade with sauce vierge.  The smell suggested the fish was as fresh as a daisy.  Expertly seasoned, the roulade was moist and tasted of the sea.  The sauce vierge was well-made and added to what was overall a great modern version of classic flavour combinations.\n\nSarah chose pigeon pithivier with wild mushrooms and Madeira jus. The pastry was properly cooked and satisfied my Paul Hollywood-esque inspection - no soggy bottoms here. \n\nShe found some of the pigeon a little chewy, although the piece I tasted was fine and the flavour was there.  The mushrooms were wonderful and woody and the jus, ahh that jus was simply sublime. \n\nThe intermediate course consisted of pan fried hake with a fricassee of vegetables, which being honest I wouldn't have expected to be included in a meal priced at \u00a325.95. Not that I was complaining, as this was a sheer joy to eat.\n\nThe fish skin was crisp and the meaty flesh was perfectly cooked. The attention to detail evident in the shelled peas and podded broad beans and a wonderfully light and creamy sauce made it as if the dish saying 'you didn't order me in the first instance and this is what you're missing'.\n\nFor main, I had roast breast of guinea fowl with confit potato, watercress and jus gras.  There's several different skills demonstrated in this dish; not just the cooking of the breast but a nifty ballotine and a neatly butchered leg were all top notch. The tasty jus gras sees the whole bird being used to its full potential; I only wish there was more of it on the plate.\n\nI have to say I thought the watercress made this dish.  The pepperiness just gave it a hint of spice and a bit of texture. The use of an ingredient bang in season tells you a lot about the ethos of the restaurant.\n\nSarah had grilled red mullet with herb crusted boulang\u00e8re potatoes and roasted red pepper salsa. Faultless execution and seasoning of the fish, which was complimented by the zingy salsa. However, Sarah felt the potatoes could have been crispier and more golden.\n\nThe raspberry sorbet was a welcome palette cleanser as I chose to finish with apple and butterscotch cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e while Sarah ordered the assiette of pear.\n\nThis was no standard br\u00fbl\u00e9e let me tell you.  Lifting the apple crisp to find the centre had been cut out to house the butterscotch sauce was rather quirky, while the outside offered the crisp exterior you would expect from a classic version of the dish.\n\nThe popcorn was a fun addition but it was sadly a little on the limp side.\n\nThe presentation of the pear dish was clean and modern and the tastes from the sorbet, cannelloni and poached pear were refreshing, light, and a thoroughly pleasant way to end any meal.\n\nPaul Gunning has honed his trade under chefs like Marco Pierre White, Jeff Bland and Jean Michel Gauffre and that shows.  His presentation of food is outstanding and no detail goes unmissed. This is a chef who has learned his craft and is now intent on putting his own stamp on the Edinburgh food landscape.\n\nAt \u00a325.95, I can't think of anywhere that offers better value for the standard of food on offer and it really is fine dining without any hint of pretention.  It's made me question how good places where I've paid considerably more actually are and I can't give a much bigger compliment than that.\n\n This gem of a restaurant and one really needs to be experienced first- hand.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 7, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Went there for their 7 course tasting menu on Friday.

Wine. \n\nI know I am in trouble when I can't focus on a topic such as wine. \n\nHe picked the Pinot Grigio Rose, Bella Modella, Italy, 2011 for our meal. \n\nOur servers hit the exact note of polite, friendly and chatty which was perfect for the small, rustic but cosy restaurant decked in charming earthy tones. \n\nThe amuse bouch\u00e9 was a Butternut Squash veloute which was sweet and creamy and the perfect accompaniment for the slice of freshly bakes cumin bread I had picked.\n\nWe then had the Sole and Salmon Roulade with Sauce Vierge which was a thing of beauty. Delicate with every little element complimenting the fresh fish. I could happily have eaten 10 of those and still want more. \n\nWe were then presented with an Crispy chicken and Asian noodle salad.  Chicken that is moist and tender on the inside with a crisp and moreish crumbed exterior served with a refreshing salad with crisp bean-sprouts and broccoli and an Asian dressing. \n\nWe then had the pan fried Hake with the Vegetable Fricasse. Crispy skin, flaky fish sitting on a bed of vegetables expertly prepared and a light creamy sauce. I was almost temped to ask for a bit of bread to mop the sauce up with. I didn't since we had 4 more courses to go.\n\nFor our main we were presented with a Roast Loin of Pork with Confit Potatoes, Stornaway Black Pudding, Pork Belly and an Apple Sauce. The Pork was deliciously tender, the plate so skilfully put together that I almost didn't want to dive in. My dinner companion pretty much inhaled his in 2 mouthfuls. \n\nWe then had a refreshing Raspberry sorbet pre-dessert and I can safely say that I would've happily had my tasting menu end there. I was comfortably full and didn't think I could manage another bite. \n\nWell that was before our Dark Chocolate Marquis with Ice Cream was placed on the table. The decadent chocolate dessert sat there and stared me in the eye. The dark gleaming square beckoned me to try it, just one spoonful it seemed to be saying. Try I did.

But with minimum competition; ok, perhaps a couple of places that might cater to similar style as this place nearby, I felt duty bound to find out if they were the best in the area, my luck was in early June.\n\nThe party I was invited to had actually won the entire wedding through a local Haddington newspaper. Well almost, they still have to iron out some creases, but hey when weddings cost as they certainly do, then it really pays to get this on. So thanks to the Courier as the organiser!\n\nThe decor inside the Quayside is dark wood, deep pile red-ish carpets, in and around the small bar downstairs, but past reception is their restaurant. Another bar upstairs on first floor and another on level 2.

Red and White wine with the dinner, roast chicken and haggis tower was a treat, as was choco pudding and cream (in the shape of a heart). With all that booze flowing some of our party later on just wanted a cup of tea, so when I requested this, the staff couldn't have been more accommodating, so top marks for producing a pot or two when they didn't really have to!\n\nFood booking drinks ambience were great, but you need three rules. 1. some ill placed seating meant my back was to the bridal table during speeches. To any future brides out there, save guests having a crick in the neck, check the table layout. 2. To make your perfect wedding even better, please get a band. 3. With reception closed well before 1am also make sure you prebook a taxi or this may incur a lengthy wait at the nearest taxi rank or bus stop.\n\nSpeaking of food, Quayside renamed their restaurant as the \"World Buffet\",(does exactly as is says). The name conjures up horrors of many a fast food joint. But with many foods available (and I did ask what they didn't produce) to which the answer was - no to fruit.

Huh? That's what you get for booking a table in a restaurant reviewed well in The Observer only days before. I knew there was a reason why I used to get so grumpy about the trendy restaurant scene.\n\n\n My mood improved as we approached the venue, not least because it was a sunny Friday, we all had the day off and we were about to eat a slap-up lunch.\n\n\n The interior, on the first floor is stripped-back dark wood, whitewash and black & white feature wallpaper. The dogs theme is subtle with a few logos, plaster models and pictures scattered here and there. Even at 12.30pm (we compromised) the place was already buzzing, providing the atmosphere. That Observer review again.\n\n\n The first thing to strike you about the menu is the prices. They are so low! Fish, chips & mushy peas for \u00a34.95. Puddings for \u00a33.50. But then you start to notice the economies: the menu on a scrap of paper, mismatched tables, chairs, crockery, glasses. Small portions, fast turnover of customers (we had to ask our waiter to go away 3 times). The menu options were good; cullen skink, goats cheese & walnut salad, black pudding & fried duck egg, jelly & ice cream, rice pudding. I can't comment on the wine list as my host chose, but his selection, a French regional white implied it was more than just the usual New world suspects.\n\n\n I still felt grumpy though. The quality of the food was good, but the presentation dull & portions bordering on mean. The service was sound, professional and entertaining but just a wee bit too smug and pretentious. I think that's my problem with The Dogs; it is a contrived concept. None of our well-heeled fellow diners needed to be on a budget. I wouldn't have minded paying \u00a36.95 for my fish & chips if it meant a decent portion of mushy peas & a bigger piece of fish. And while I like eclectic, it doesn't mean random charity shop.\n\n\n Bottom line? If they hadn't made a thing of needing the table back when I booked, if they hadn't made us feel rushed and if they'd bumped up the portions and prices just a tad it would be a great place to eat lunch.

Note:  when you first take a bite, you may not get a bit of the capers, but do not salt until you have had some of the capers.

As with many places we came across on our travels in Europe, it was a bit hard to figure out where to go and who to talk to, we just sort of stumbled up some stairs and waited around until someone popped their head out to greet us (signage and/or a hostess stand by the door would help tremendously, not just here but in most other Euro restaurants IMO). Like another Yelper mentioned, were told we could have the table until 7:45 which wasn't a problem (I'm glad we knew to expect this, because this isn't something we Yanks are used to- thanks Yelp!). \n\nWine was the way to go for drinks (beer selection wasn't that good and was pricey), and we had a lovely Montepulciano and ordered some artisanal bread and butter to start; butter was fresh, bread was too tough for my liking and not as flavorful as it could have been (seemed burned on the bottom to boot).\n\nI got the pan fried hake fillet with smoked fish potato cake and mustard sauce, and it was really flavorful and well cooked... I'd never really had hake before but this dish made me want to seek it out elsewhere (such a lovely flavor), and the mustard sauce had me thinking about licking the plate (the potato cake was of course delicious as well, as was the spinach hidden atop of it). The boy got chicken and ham pie which he also found delicious. The main & bread was enough to stuff me, but the boy had some room for a post-meal coffee (which was actually real coffee, a nice surprise after running into tons of instant coffee while in the UK).\n\nOur waitress was polite and cute (we felt so bad when fellow Americans came in shortly after us and were grilling her about every little thing on the menu that she clearly didn't know the answer to and was super nervous...

I was actually going to try Amore Dogs, but I just thought I'd take a cheeky peek at The Dogs' menu.  It was a cheeky peek alright...  PIG'S CHEEKS!  I know.  I know.  Many of you out there are thinking, \"Disgusting\" or if you're American, \"Gross\", however, I have been wanting to try pig's cheeks and it doesn't help that Simon cooked them on 'Something for the Weekend' and continued my fascination with these little parcels of heaven.  That being said, there were about a dozen more items on The Dogs' menu that spoke to me more than on the Amore Dogs' menu.\n\nI was the only one there, so I got to choose my seat... a lovely table next to the window so I could watch the world go by.  The waitress was lovely, but I got the feeling that the guy that was occasionally bring things out to me was either judging me for eating solo and/or annoyed that I had not made a reservation.  Anyway I chose the Williams Red Ale to go with my Pig's Cheeks in a Cider Stew with Wholegrain Mustard Mash... although for a hot second I considered the Pork Belly cooked in cola. \n\nI decided to start with the Spiced Carrot and Lentil Soup.  The flavour was wonderful, but I was partially expecting the carrots to be pureed, however there were chunks of carrot in the broth.  I also did not find any lentils, however the crusty bread I had soaked up the soup nicely.  Shortly after, the main I have been waiting for all my life appeared in front of me.  The portion was just right for me, but a hungry man might find it a bit small, so make sure you have a starter!\n\nThere were three cheeks with a few carrots and celery on top of a nicely sized scoop of the wholegrain mustard mash, sitting in some of the cider broth.  The cheeks were so tender!  They were literally little pillows of meaty goodness.  I don't know if it was the mustard in the mashed potatoes, but I didn't get much of the cider from the broth, but every now and then I could taste a bit of apple, I think I would have liked a little more of that flavour.  I ate all of it and even used some of the leftover bread to sop up the rest of the broth.  And the red ale really went well with the whole thing.\n\nThe waitress came back and asked if I wanted dessert or coffee, I must have looked a bit distressed on whether I should or shouldn't and she said, \"I can bring a menu, but you don't have to order, you can just look.\"  That was all I needed, then again, looking at a dessert menu usually leads to me ordering a dessert.  And this did.  I chose the Toffee Rice Pudding with the Apple Compote.  It came out in a small bowl... a caramelly colour with a few bits of apple on top.  To be honest, I wished they had left the apple off... the Toffee Rice Pudding was spot on!  It was creamy, it was sticky, it was full of toffee flavour, it was just the right kind of dessert for a cold, winter evening.  And the small portion was just right because it was so rich and it is rice, so it was more than enough.\n\nIt was a perfect winter dinner from start to end and while I could have gotten away with paying under \u00a320 because the guy left my ale off of the bill, but I was honest about it, I still think what I paid for three courses and a drink was totally worth it.

I first ate at one of Ramsden's restaurants in the late 90s at 'Rogue' and it was clear that he was a man ahead of his time.  Stylish by today's standards it was simply too cosmopolitan, smart and forward thinking for Edinburgh in those days.  It would have worked and thrived in London. The Dogs is another well conceived idea, but crucially this time, with immaculate timing.\n\nPopping in for a Saturday lunch, it was busy and humming with chatter.  The restaurant is a slightly idiosyncratic shape, with 2 separate dining rooms and almost everything within, from cushions to paintings, adorned by pictures of cute, four-legged friends.  Quickly seated by  Mr Ramsden himself who looks like a slightly intimidating Richard O'Brien, we were given excellent service throughout. Every table has a large jug of iced water awaiting the customer, top marks for value, a theme that would run through the meal all the way to the happy ending that was the very reasonable bill.\n\nWith 'nose to tail' cuts a speciality, I plumped for the 'devilled ox liver, onions, bacon and mushrooms on toast' (6.45).  It was simply superb.  Big chunks of perfectly cooked liver were complimented by the salty bacon and tangy, spicy sauce. The toast mopped up all the flavour as well as giving the dish a bit of much-needed body.  You could taste the quality of every ingredient and it really stood out as a perfect marriage of textures and taste. My partner had 'roasted squash, goat cheese and spring onion barley risotto' (6.45) which was a much more subtle taste combination  and very light. The dish was well-balanced, with the squash every bit as prominent as the potentially overpowering Goat's Cheese.\n\nFor dessert we shared an 'apple, shortbread and vanilla rice pudding' (4.75).  The light, vanilla infused rice pudding was covered in a shortbread crumble with some stewed and very flavoursome apples in the centre. The creaminess of the pudding was expertly offset by the sweetness of the apples. Another perfectly balanced dish, I wolfed through it with some gusto.\n\nThe standard of cooking is impressive.  Simple ideas done so well that it's only in analysing their excellence that the true culinary intelligence shines through.  At the end of the meal I told David Ramseden that my Liver was possibly the best dish I have had in 6 months.  He replied 'I'm glad you enjoyed it. Tell all your friends!'.

My rabbit was okay, with the accompanying dauphinoise cake a particular highlight.\n\nAnd then to puddings! Mum is a massive fan of the lemon posset, and it once again lived up to its reputation. Glorious. But the berry and apple tart dad and I ordered was more of a disappointment. The flavours were fine, and the aniseed custard was subtle. But it was so cold it was verging on frozen.

Slap some trendy prints and a few dog photos on the walls of an old house and, presto, trendy restaurant.  Eclectic \"found furniture\" sort of seating, mostly wooden chairs and benches.

We had to go find someone, who then waived us toward a table.  Our waiter was doing a constant (unintentional?) impersonation of James Carlin (who also would have sucked as a waiter).  He was full of snide comments for any questions about the menu.  Most things delivered to the table were practically dropped on it as he rushed past on his way to point snark at other tables.

We arrived to be shown promptly to our table by the friendly staff who immediately made us feel welcome and offered any help with questions while we perused the menu. \n\nWe were seated in the back area which reminded me of a friends living room that has impeccable taste in interior d\u00e9cor. It was relaxed yet with the perfect balance of formal and informal that makes you feel like you're somewhere special but not that you can't relax and enjoy yourself.\n\nIt didn't take long for us to make our dining decisions, we chose the Chateau Ka wine from Lebanon after a recommendation from my DPIC and we were not disappointed at all. I went for the Orkney Scallops with lentils, apple, caramel and crackling as I was intrigued by the combination of flavours for a starter and being a fan of a classic steak chose that for mains.\n\nThe scallops were tender and fresh, and the lentils added a wonderful texture perfectly balancing the sweetness of the apple and caramel, the crackling added a lovely 'bite' and it was beautifully presented. The steak was perfectly done to order, however the pesto tomato was a little over loaded with pesto but a small complaint given when you order steak it's the meat that's the star.\n\nMy DPIC ordered the beef tartare, and after stealing a fork full I can confirm it tasted wonderful with a wonderful crisp fresh crunch from the onions. For her main she ordered the lamb which was again perfectly cooked but she felt there was a little too much 'going on' with the sweetbread, anchovy and almond garnish. We're both of the opinion when it comes to a meat dish, less is more but this is personal opinion after all.\n\nWe decided to finish off the evening with a shared cheese board and some port, the staff again demonstrated their knowledge by walking us through the cheeses on the board and informing us they were displayed from mild to strong across the board. We ordered the Fonseca 97 Port as my DPIC informed me she still dreamt about the port from when she'd been in 2010. And it was everything it was built up to be, so we had a second glass just to be able to savour it a little longer. \n\nThe cheese was a good mix of hard and soft, and whilst we're both cheese fiends we didn't find the strongest one over powering and we easily polished them all off as the portion sizes were just right.\n\nOverall we had a lovely evening there, I'd recommend this venue for special occasions with friends, romantic dinners or if you have friends from out of town staying. Make sure your guests spot the Angel with Bagpipes statue which the restaurant is named after, her whistful expression makes me think she also might be thinking of the glass of port and cheese she's going to have at the end of her shift.\n\nOh, and in case you're wondering.

Hence, the question about my husband's intestinal health soon afterwards (he's fine but felt like he dodged a bullet). The uninspired mashed potatoes came with a generic gravy and frozen peas.\n\nThe fried fish was overbreaded, greasy and soggy on the bottom from either the moisture of the fish or the oil pool on the plate. The accompanying tartar sauce was too heavy on the mayo and lacked acidity to cut through the richness of the sauce.

The slices themselves were fairly meaty with some fat for flavor. Gravy did an excellent job complementing the meat. Peas and carrots were your average canned sweet peas, the carrots were boiled down to the point where they were soft but mostly lost all their sweet carrotie goodness. The potato was interesting. Seemed they boiled it first then deep fried it to give it flavor and a crispy shell, potatoes are good... Yorkshore pudding wasnt exactly my favorite but who cares? We're here for lamb and we had some lamb.\n\nOverall 10.95 is a bit pricey for the plate hence the three star instead of a four.

So when a good friend came to visit and needed some afternoon snackage, I was keen to try it out.\n\nShe ordered haddock goujons and chips, whilst I just had a tea. It made my day that the tea came with a small square of tiffin type traybake. Such a nice touch. The haddock goujons were presented quite elaborately in a small metal pot, spilling over the top. Very fresh, light batter. The chips were a bit forgettable but the haddock was lovely (yes I did try).\n\nThe interior is fresh, modern, quite simple but also with style. Open brick work, greens and browns, and the absolutely stunning view from the top of the mound. My only concern is that this place will become very popular very soon.\n\nBut they do have an exciting looking Brunch menu that I will be back to try on a Sunday. I haven't been able to find somewhere with the right mix of restaurant, bar and cafe that does a good all-day Sunday brunch in the near vicinity.

And so when WHISKI Rooms opened up on the Mound, and I passed it day on day with all that liquid sunshine beaming out at me, I knew it wouldn't be long before I stopped in here to sample what was on offer.\n\nThe boy and I came here for a Friday evening meal. It was a lovely sunny evening and around 7.30 the place was almost full but had a really nice relaxed ambience about it, rather than rushed.\n\nI had a craving for seafood, but didn't fancy the salmon in the mains section so asked if it was possible to have the scallops starter as a main. All they did was double up the portion size, and price, equally but this suited me fine. The boy had the soup and then the burger.\n\nThe scallops, served on black pudding, were really quite delicious. The scallops were beautifully cooked and the contrast of the crispy black pudding was just mmm. It looked like a fairly small portion (despite being doubled) - it was 6 scallops in total. But I had it with a side of the seasonal veg and struggled to finish it all. The seasonal veg was also really nicely cooked - shredded cabbage and carrots, neither covered in butter or dried out - just right.\n\nThe boy's soup was, I have to say, a little bland. But hey, you win some you lose some. Despite being a creamy soup it just lacked much flavour. His burger was epic, a giant hand-made beast with bacon and a delicious WHISKI sauce and onion relish. As far as burgers go, it was good. The chips, I am told, were a little meh. (The burger + chip combo is an important one.)\n\nNow, the drinks. The cocktail list has a whole page (or more) dedicated to whisky cocktails. Oh yes. My favourite cocktail is a margarita. And what did they have? A whisky-rita. That's right, a margarita made with whisky. It even came in a margarita glass, salt-rimmed. I have to say a margarita with tequila is still better for this combination BUT I really enjoyed it and loved the ingenuinty and cheeky take on it. The whisky sour I had after was one of the better ones I've had in the city too.\n\nYou need to ask for the whisky menu itself, as this isn't provided as standard on the table. But when you do be prepared to get those reading glasses out. It's very long, in very small print. I'd guess at least over 100 whiskies. The boy was happy. And the one he ordered, a new Islay one we hadn't tried yet (Aird Bheag) hit the spot nicely.\n\nThe staff were really friendly, and the waitress and I had a wee laugh when she came to ask about my order just as I was taking a sample bite of the boys burger, which as I said was epic. Friendly, familiar and down-to-earth but still very attentive.\n\nOH! I forgot to mention the chocolate mousse. A really generous serving, really quite dense and rich which was looovellly although we were both really full from our mains.\n\nI had a really nice evening here for a relaxed post-work dinner. You could definitely rock up here straight after work and enjoy a nice meal without feeling under-dressed but it's also got some class.

Having read many glowing reviews of the restaurant, I came in with high expectations, and somehow, my dining experience exceeded these expectations. Chef Dominic Jack and his staff treated me to a fantastic meal, and I came away thoroughly impressed with the food, service, and overall experience offered by Castle Terrace.\n\nArriving for the 12 pm lunch seating on a rainy Saturday afternoon, I opted for the three course, \u00a320 lunch prix fixe menu. Shortly after being seated, I was served an array of canap\u00e9s which included crisp bread sticks, assorted cheese crackers, squid ink and basil pastas, and a tomato/olive cracker. The savory flavors permeating most of these small bites was a nice welcoming gesture. After placing my orders, I received an amuse bouche of tomato and basil salad with crumbled olives. Light and refreshing, this dish was aesthetically appealing as well, as the black olive crumbles, resembling finely crushed Oreo cookies, gave the appearance of fresh soil on the ground. Also, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the fantastic breads served with the meal. Given five choices - white, granary, three seed, onion, and spelt - the breads were all delicious, particularly the onion, which I had at least three pieces of.\n\nFor my first course, I opted for the Pork dish. Described as \"Braised and seared Ayrshire pork belly, served with black pudding and apple,\" this dish was just as delicious as it was visually appealing. The pork belly had a nice char to it and was complemented nicely by the apple and jus on the plate. \n\nMy second course was the Rabbit option, and it consisted of a \"Pithivier of braised rabbit from Roxburghshire, served with peas and carrots.\" With the pastry containing only rabbit meat and with the carrot and pea sauces smeared on the plate, the dish was sort of like a partly deconstructed pot pie. The pastry was nice and flaky, and the rabbit was nicely seasoned, albeit a bit too heavily with the salt. \n\nI ended the meal with the Chocolate course, which was described as \"Chocolate panna cotta and rice pudding, served with apricot sorbet.\" The pairing of chocolate with the apricot sorbet was a bit unusual, but the creamy panna cotta and rice puddings were both thoroughly enjoyable. A nice finish to the meal.\n\nService at Castle Terrace was impeccable, as I was treated well throughout the meal and was never made to feel rushed. In summary, the food, service, and atmosphere of Castle Terrace are first-class, and the lunch prix fixe is definitely a bargain. I actually had a more enjoyable meal here than at more well-known restaurants with more awards, and I fully expect Castle Terrace to land a Michelin star or two in the not-so-distant future.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Recently awarded its first Michelin star, Castle Terrace is one of the hottest restaurant tickets in town, at the moment.

This was a proper romantic evening.  Oh sure, the girlfriend and I had enjoyed dinners before, but not like this, all dressed up the tens (way better than nines).  We took our seats in a secluded area able to be detached via curtains to the rest of the restaurant...which offered the illusion we were either special or pariahs not meant for the eyes to Edinburgh's elite.  I had already made the declaration that we would be tackling the tasting menu, an option I wished more restaurants would offer despite the intimidating price.  Flipping to the end of this tale, the meal cost me nearly $300 cdn for two, which included two glasses of wine and the additional extravagance of adding shaved truffles to my risotto...because apparently I liked the idea of eating something worth its weight in palladium.\n\nSo let me get all snobbish, pretentious, and a little patronizing, Castle Terrace didn't start the meal with an amuse bouche, rather we each received a small plate of canap\u00e9s --a caper and cumin burger, a salt cod barbajuan, and a Caesar salad--all miniature bite-sized.  The latter was the most impressive, literally exploding in your mouth.  The bread which followed was served in its own toque-like bowl.  Yup, the bread came with its own adorable little hat.  The appetizer was a bizarre take on baked potato with cheese served in a ramekin.  This was shortly followed by the tartare of Loch Duart salmon served sushi-style with wasabi ice cream.  This was a favorite of both of ours--a true avant garde art piece.  The wasabi ice cream was a particular surprise.  The fourth dish was seared hand-dived Orkney scallops served with a light curry 'Castle Terrace' style.  \nCastle Terrace seems to revel in naming the origin of its ingredients, an attribute often seen in many high-end restaurants.  Personally I don't require it; they only exist to make the titles longer.  I don't know the importance of an Orkney scallop picked by hand over one pulled off the coast of Vancouver.  Is Orkney really that much better?  \n\nThen came the risotto made with organic spelt from Doves Farm--REALLY?  Is it that important where the grain came from?  While my girlfriend's risotto was topped by ox tongue and chirozo, mine was layered in wafer-thin truffle shavings.  It might have been more expensive, but mine wasn't as good as the one opposite of me, proof that price does not reflect value.  At this point, you would think we were done, but not, we still had three more courses to go.  The fish dish was my personal favorite--roasted fillet of North Sea (sigh) hake served with an Asian style broth poured at the plate.  The pork dish after was an immensely attractive fillet of Ayrsh--just pork, it was pork...served with braised fennel, smoked aubergine puree and basil gnocchi.  Finally the dessert was a bavarois of 'conference' pears served with a yogurt sorbet and rosemary caramel.\n\nThere were many details about the dishes I'm leaving out, like the way the pork sat in a sauce kept in place by the puree or that the broth for the hake was poured over it, sending its toppings cascading down the sides to form the ingredients of a soup.  Or how about that each dish had its own arrangement of cutlery; the fish dish was served with a large blunt knife and a trident.  \n\nCastle Terrace mixes the molecular gastronomic talents seen with Teatro but doesn't go as far in the realms of the bizarre, making each dish slightly more accessible.  The flavors were divine, marking Castle Terrace as a real jewel in the city.  Would I recommend it?  It depends if you have such money to set aside that you don't require for procuring shelter.  You have to really want such an evening, which we did.  With that out of the way, I'm not saying that you need to spend that kind of money to have a great experience in Edinburgh.  My review for Witchery was glowing and they cost barely half as much, the same goes for Shezan, which cost half THAN THAT.  Upon an inevitable return to Edinburgh, I can't see going to Castle Terrace again given so many options which would certainly cost a lot less.  But once in a life, I think everyone needs to take in a place like Teatro, Claridges, or Castle Terrace.  Pick whichever one is closer and go.  And take the girlfriend or wife, not the kids or your poker buddy.  I would also permit sister or mother because well...guilty as charged.

All good, but slightly more interesting and small than actually truly tasty. I'm also a bit surprised that they seem to have been serving the same canapes since at least the end of 2013. \n\nFollowing the canapes, we were treated with a \"cheesy baked potato\" amuse bouche, which was absolutely brilliant.

The taste was great, though.\n\nOur mains were the highlight.

The Man fell in love with his squid cannelloni and thought the spelt risotto was the best he'd ever had.\n\nFollowing the bites, the amuse bouche, the gorgeous warm sourdough (which I forgot to mention), starters and mains, we were pretty stuffed.

Our server was nice and explained their menu, which is separated into parts as most are.  They have their seafood appetizers, their carney--assorted meats sold in 1/2 pound or 1 pound orders with bread and your choice of sauce--sammies, and sides.  Their wine menu is very extensive and quite impressive for a pub, so make sure to check it out while you're there.  \n\nWe ordered a 1/2 pound of lamb for an appetizer with pita and black truffle mayo, mini corn dogs with fries, their grilled cheese and a fried bologna sandwich.  I know what you're thinking--this food sounds too simple and not worth the money.  WRONG!  Their portions are huge and definitely not the type of grilled cheese or bologna I could make at home.  Here's the breakdown of the meal:\n\n1/2lb lamb with black truffle mayo and pita: As suggested by our waiter, we went with the bread and sauce he recommended, although there are several choices.  The lamb is so tender, juicy, and seasoned just right.  I cannot believe how good that lamb is, and is one of the reasons I'll go there on a regular basis.  I wanted to order the other meats to try, but a 1/2lb can serve three people in all honesty.  Great starter.  It's a meal as well, if you prefer, but you can request it to come out as an appetizer if you choose.\n\nCorn dogs: cute miniature corn dogs that are great!  They make their own corn batter and fries, all truly good and better than those frozen ones I buy at the market for sure.  They do not have any condiments on the table--that's because they make their ketchup and mustard!  I dipped my dogs in their ketchup, which is slightly sweeter than the store bought, but I liked it.\n\nGrilled Cheese: it's named something weird on the menu, but you'll recognize it from the description.  They use several cheeses and throw in sliced heirloom tomatoes and applewood smoked bacon, too. It's panini pressed into their fresh bread and served with your choice of fries.  I went for sweet potato fries and I ate it all up!  the grilled cheese is definitely for cheese lovers only.  They use a stronger cheese mix, so beware.  However, it's lovely, gooey, and huge!  I had to share it with my niece's boyfriend because I couldn't finish the sandwich alone.  i did, however, eat the entire bucket of sweet potato fries with their house ketchup.  I love how sweet they are but with that salty outside.  It's also a great alternative to the regular potato fry.\n\nFried bologna sammie with fatty fries: My niece loved it!  i tried a piece of the deli sliced bologna and I'll never eat store-bought again!  It was salty and had that nice pork flavor to it, and when it's fried in butter, it tastes even better!  Again, huge portions--enough for 2--and the fatty fries were well seasoned with simple salt.  Great hangover food choice, I think.\n\nWe didn't try any of their desserts and I am not sure if they have a dessert menu because I didn't ask.  However, I doubt anyone would eat anything after a regular order of food!\n\nYou have to ask your server what they recommend for the day because they know what's best.  Let them know your tastes, and they'll guarantee a great meal!\n\nOverall, I'm thrilled with this pub and will be a regular here for lunch and dinner.

It should be named \"ground chicken sliders with acidic tomato sauce\".  And you only get three, and I believe it's an \"entree\" dish!  Not an appetizer.  Booooo.\n\nMy fish n' chips were good, but nothing that other pubs should be worried about.  Two pieces of fried Cod, and the batter was good.  Crispy, although a bit too thick.  The fish itself was a tad overcooked and rubbery, but shake some malt vinegar on it and you're good to go.  It comes with thick/steak cut fries.  The dipping sauces are tartar and a creamy malt vinegar.  I prefer regular malt vinegar, which you have to ask for..    odd for an English pub.  Usually they have cruets or the Heinz version of it on the table.  $18?  That's not right.

Despite being over-sized, the bun was awesome. To top it all off, the seasoned skinny fries were fantastic. \n\nOnce the beer, burger, and fries were gone, it was time. Bring on the PBR.

I ordered the brisket carvery with a side of fries (fries are ordered separately) and I probably could have shared it with somebody.   There was so much food I left half the sandwich on the plate.  The brisket was extremely tasty, and the condiments I chose (truffle mayo, horseradish sour cream) were both fantastic.  The ambience was also great, as it was like an upscale more sophisticated sports bar in a \"publike\" atmosphere.  \n\nOverall, I give this place five stars, especially when viewed in light of all the other options in Vegas (all the extremely high priced ones that is).  My sole complaint is that the hostess said we would have to wait to sit outside and the server outside said there was no wait to sit outside.

We sat inside and the first thing we noticed were the humorous placemats that have lots of intersting beer quotes on them. \n\nOur service was okay, one of the 2 things that knocked this down from 5 stars. The waitress took a LONG time to bring us our beers; my girlfriend ordered a 2nd beer during her meal that didn't arrive until she was completely done with it, thus negating the point of a beer. The waitress made no attempt to comp things like bringing out the other kind of tea because they didn't have the one we wanted, or bringing things out late. Although she did apologize. \n\nThe food itself was amazing, and that's where all 4 stars come in and then some. We started with the mussel cocktail which comes out with delicious sauces and about 12 pieces for only 5 bucks. I ordered from the carvery - lamb, and went with the waitresses' recommendation of sauces - horseradish sour cream and pineapple sauce on pita. It was amazing, paired with sweet potato fries (ask for ranch to dip). My girlfriend got the burger which was really good, my brother went with the grichebachtom which was an interesting twist on a grilled cheese sandwitch that turned out very well. \n\nThe beer selection was awesome, and so were the cocktails. I forget the name of my cocktail but it was gin, cucumber, st. germain, and a couple of other things. It really hit the spot, and the beers my party ordered did too, however some of them were extremely overpriced in my opinion. Another thing which was priced high was the raw bar with seafood options - 4.50$ per shrimp for a shrimp cocktail. The oysters were delicious but everything else was pretty damn expensive. \n\nOverall a great place to go for lunch; expect to drop around 20$ on the entree, 10-15$ a drink, at the least.

OMG it's wonderful on ANYTHING. You've made a mistake if you don't choose it ! So the brisket was just OK, definitely not best BBQ in vegas material or anything. The duck was FANTASTIC. Only pet peeve here was they just shoved 1/2 a duck on our plate. So much for their \"carvery\". If I'm paying you $30 for half a duck can you cut it up for me damnit?! Other than having to carve our own duck at the bar, I absolutely adored that dish. Would get it again and again. Does duck go with black truffle mayo? Oh hell YES it does!

The malt vinegar aioli was unpleasant as well. Sour mayonaise? I'd like to stick to malt vinegar, thank you very much.\n\nThe chicken pot pie fared (around $20) better but still had some issues.

If you can drink a pint of beer in 7 seconds or less, it's free.  \n\nNow, let me be clear.  I do not have that skill with any sort of liquid.  But some of my friends do so it was fun to go with them and watch.  The promotion used to be unlimited.  But, as these things go, the rumor from the staff is that someone ruined it by chugging 11 Guinesses in a short amount of time, bringing up questions of potential alcohol poisoning and lawsuits.  So they limited to 8 beers.  Fine.  That's reasonable.\n\nBut then they limited to 4 beers for no apparent reason. Now the promotion, which part of their logo and permanent decor, is limited to 2 beers.  \n\nTheir other promotion, 5 cent PBR night, has also gotten lame.  At first, when they started it in April, it was so laid back.  We'd sit at the bar and order the 5 cent PBRs (served in 8 oz plastic cups) during the requisite hours (Tues after 9pm).  Now, even if you spend $50+ at the bar beforehand, they make you get up and go outside to get a wristband.  I get that the promotion has become popular but, cmon.  If we've been sitting at the bar already, you hopefully know we are of age.  Just give us the damn wristband instead of making us go out in the cold to get it!\n\nOh, here's an interesting incident.  During 5 cent PBR night, the staff made a group a girls get up and give up their seats at the bar to a guy who wanted to order food.  The guy was extremely uncomfortable with this but the staff was insistent... they wanted the sale.  The guy made up for it by being nice to the girls, buying them drinks (besides 5 cent PBR) etc.  But WTF?\n\nFinally, the food has gone way downhill.  The dirty chips used to be extremely craveable.  Last time I got them, the portion size was smaller and they were nasty and soggy.  \n\nThe staff here has been really good to me.  They'd make recommendations and let me try drinks beforehand that they thought were questionable.  I even got some free refills on cocktails and beer.  It was a fun place to go and chat with the nice bartenders.  I like the staff and really want to like this place, but I think management has cut corners for some reason and screwed it all up.

Never one to eat processed snack foods this was a rare experience for me with potato chips (or popcorn) and although the others ate more than myself, I loved the way the crisp chips held up to the ample toppings and despite the sheer gluttons of the dish the flavor profile was nicely balanced, albeit quite heavy.\n\n\"Grichebactom.\"  Described as the \"workman's\" grilled cheese I'm not so sure many \"workmen\" find this in their lunchbox, but the combination of grilled sourdough, creamy brie cheese, double smoked bacon, and fresh tomatoes with a side of skinny fries was certainly delicious.  Using the fries largely as a delivery mechanism for Chef English's signature ketchup and BBQ sauce the chunky ketchup was outstanding, loaded with smoke and garlic while the BBQ was a tad sweeter than I'd prefer.  \n\nBLT Sliders with Nueskes bacon, roma tomato, maple aioli, and skinny fries. Served as three buttery rolls loaded with supple bacon, sweet tomatoes, and crisp lettuce the aioli was actually quite mild and more hickory than maple.  Another large portion considering the price and ingredients a whole sandwich ended up packed to go home along with most of the fries.\n\nDuck buns - a rather Asian inspired dish placing confit leg in an aromatic and sweet hoisin sauce on steamed buns, my first bite was good - the confit excellent.  Next adding the cucumber slaw and cool yogurt sauce, this is where the buns truly shined - as good as any steamed bun I've had, whether Dim Sum or David Chang.\n\nLobster Poppie with yorkshire pudding, creamy corn, and brown butter lobster.  Essentially a pot pie with a significant portion of buttery fresh lobster baked atop flaky pastry and dressed In chipotle sauce and house made sweet cream corn the flavors were excellent, though the chipotle was a tad overwhelming in bites where too much had soaked into the pastry.  Listed as a sharable appetizer I'm not sure how well this would divide as it was rather small, but as a main course it would satisfy most.\n\nMona's bread pudding with English toffee sauce, salted caramel ice cream, cap'n crunch.  A large brick of lovely custardized bread with a bruleed top, the bread pudding itself was loaded with cinnamon, sugar, and rum.  Resting in a boozy toffee sauce that tasted largely butterscotch and topped with whipped cream and salty caramel ice cream the dish was finished with a playful handful of children's cereal.  Intensely sweet but subtle in the way all the ingredients contributed to the overall flavor the dish was simple and wonderful\n\n\"Ninja Snacks,\" a plate of eight crispy wontons filled with nutella and banana served with \"ninja sauce\" that tasted quite similar to my English toffee.  Naming issues aside, the wontons themselves were excellent and absolutely stuffed with filling.  Using sliced banana instead of a puree lent texture beyond the crispy wrappers and while the sauce wasn't necessary it certainly didn't hurt.\n\n\"The Elvis,\" a dish described as pound cake, peanut butter, br\u00fbl\u00e9ed bananas, maple bacon and served with a shirley temple.  Delivered as two \"sandwiches\" utilizing pound cake as the bread it really isn't that the dish was poorly designed as it was that the cake was simply too dry.  Tasty otherwise, especially the bacon/maple/banana/peanut butter combination, the Shirley Temple was very sweet and obviously added more for kitsch than flavor.  The chocolate covered peanut was also quite tasty.\n\nChocolate Rendezvous, would essentially represent a chocolate cr\u00e8me brulee topped with peanut butter mousse, topped with marshmallow, and then finished in the oven.  A parfait of sorts with different textures as the spoon proceeded downward the dish was actually too large for something so rich...like the bread pudding and ninja snacks it was a dessert that could have easily been shared, and so it was.\n\nIn a city where the rich and the poor are quite well represented (The amenities, the shopping, the restaurants, and the patrons) it is nice to see there are some places still targeting the \"middle\" and doing a good job with a \"something for everyone\" approach.

The beef wasn't really seasoned (though I guess that's standard in many places) so didn't really taste great.  The slider buns were pretty good - nice flavor and texture.  It let you eat your slider without things spilling everywhere.  But overall it just didn't taste that great.  Even the onions they serve it with get lost in the strength of the slider's sauce as well as the pickles served with it.  \nMini corn dogs with skinny fries - Corn dogs were, again, bland.  The batter had a nice texture but don't think it offered much flavor beyond just kind of a normal sweetness.  The dogs were made of decent meat (I think) but just not seasoned.  Fries were ok - but they did get soggy towards the bottom of the cup.  Not so bad since they would get cold served on a plate (there were lots of them).\n\nI'm willing to try again as it looked like a really cool place and the Aria poker room is my new favorite.

Starting out though, the decor was interesting with a mix of high celining and tile floor brasserie and modern english pub styles.\n\nWhen we arrived we were promptily seated despite not having everyone in our group there.  We ordered a few drinks to keep us occupied as we perused the interesting menu.  Unfortunately our waiter wasn't quite as attentive as I would've liked, but I may blame that on some of our group showing up late and maybe he was thinking we'd wait for them. Over the night, we did also wait a little longer than usual for drink orders. I had a nice little find in Newcastle's Werewolf though.\n\nFoodwise, I was severely disappointed no one at our table wanted the dirty chips. I knew I stood no chance against them alone, so I directed my efforts elsewhere. Oh well... the wife decided to get the ahi poke on wonton chips, which the tuna was nice and fresh but it lacked in seasoning and the wontons were kind of greasy and stale.  I also had a taste of someone's pretzel and wit whiz (I would imagine that means it is supposed to have some witbeer in it). The pretzel had a nice chew, but the whiz was pretty bland.  \n\nFortunately I ordered the pastrami along with the truffle mayo and blue cheese fondue.  The pastrami alone would've given this place at least a 4.  It is super juicy and tender, not too salty, and just a hint of smoke and spice.  The truffle mayo isn't mind blowingly good, but its pretty tasty.  The blue cheese fondue was easily forgotten in favor of the mayo.  The two slices of thick cut rye were just about right for making 2 open face sandwiches with just enough extra pastrami to nibble on its own.  Despite the make it yourself method, at $16 this is a pretty good deal considering the quantity and quality.

Eventually both hostess come back together and I am not joking both ignore me as I am standing 2 feet away, with a line behind me. Thankfully the (executive?) chef comes by and all of the sudden the hostess see I'm standing. We are then seated. \n\nUpon examining the beer list on the menu/chalkboards we still have a few questions so when our waitress comes by we ask her about the \"trappists\" beers they carry. The menu just says Rochefort, and I ask her which of the Rochefort's she carries but she has no idea. After checking she comes back and tells us it's the Rochefort \"8\" (which by the way is the worst of the three that the brewery makes, why would you carry that one). So we decide on Dechutes The Abyss instead. For some reason she only rudely asks for my ID, even though my friends and I are all the same age, watch out ABC. 5 Minutes later she comes back and informs us that they are all out of the Abyss...of course...  Since the rest of their beer list is very boring and unoriginal I'm forced to order an Arrogant Bastard. My friends order their beers and she runs away as I am trying to order Appetizers. I flag her down and order some sliders and pretzels. Our beers come out and I immediately know that beer I ordered is wrong. Its much much darker than it is supposed to be and tastes nothing like the Arrogant Bastard. I try to find my waitress but to no avail. So i set my beer on the edge of the table, fully untouched, but she ignores it. A food runner drops off our \"toasted\"pretzels and they are stone cold. Worse than any pretzel I have ever had in my life. I place our untouched pretzels with the beer at the edge of the table praying to God someone will take them away from us.

It very much had a gastropub feel and it was quite loud.

It was also quite spicy.\n\nI also had the bangers and mash.  The mashed potatoes were good.  They were very light for mashed potatoes and had a good flavor.  They kind of reminded me of the mashed potatoes at Nick & Stef's in Downtown LA.  The bangers were quite bland though.  They were moist enough, but they had very little flavor.  They sat on a creamy mustard sauce, which was also bland.\n\nI tried some of my friend's fries, which were just okay (a little soft).  My friend mentioned that the fish and chips were bland.\n\nService was decent.  The staff was friendly, but it was hard to flag down our waiter at times (which is a common problem when you eat outside and the outside dining area is not that connected to the inside dining area).\n\nPrices were not too bad for Las Vegas.

For years I have wanted to go to a Todd English place in Vegas ( he has three of them) and so this vacation my wife, Simone and i did.  The first problem I had was actually finding the entrance. You can see the place from the inside of Aria but the only entrance that i could find was from the outside walkway. At any rate, when we got to the P.U.B, the place was rather large and it was packed full of people. our waitress was able to squeeze us in at a table once again right beside the restrooms (this always happens to me). While I took advantage of being so close to the crapper Simone took a look at the menus. The P.U.B features an open kitchen so you can watch the chefs making the food. This is always a good thing as it helps pass the time while you wait for your meal and also gives you a good indication of the quality of the place. The menu is extensive with a complete carvery menu for those meat lovers that includes turkey, beef, duck, chicken and more. Also a raw bar and many grill choices. Simone and I started with an appetizer called Duck Buns.  These were extra large Hoison shredded Duck filled steamed dumplings. They were topped with scallions and served with Ailoi for dipping. They were pillowey and soft on the outside and the duck overflowing from them was steaming hot and tender. They were a very good start to our meal.  Next up were the entrees. Simones choice was, of course, a salad. The chopped Salad to be exact, and that is what it looked like when it arrived.  A bunch of vegetables and lettuce, chopped with dressing. Simone liked it. I didn't bother to even take a picture, that's how excited it made me, but i suppose its hard to make a bunch of rabbit food all that special. Perhaps stupidly so, I went a bit more adventurous with my meal. I went for the Brown Bag Lunch. Artisan Bologna Sandwich on simple white bread with melted cheese and Mayo and a side of chips.  I have not had Bologna in years and about 8 hours later ,I would remember why, but i digress. The Bologna was sliced thin and grilled until the edges were crispy then served on white bread with melted Swiss.  When it arrived at the table it looked kinda pornographic but I dug in anyway. It was definitely artisan and homemade, not your lunch meat variety Bologna. It was kicking with lots of spice and garlic. Good, but perhaps to spicy for my already pickled stomach after a week long battle with gluttony in the City of Vegas.  Being the trooper that I am, I pushed through and finished the entire sandwich and then of course had to move on to the dessert menu.  We went with the Mona-Resee dessert option, basically it was a tasting plate that included homemade Twinkies, a cupcake, red velvet cake, a cookie and even some cookie dough. Simone and I both enjoyed this and Simone took some with her for the rest of her late night chocolate fixes. But this is not where this review ends...as mentioned earlier,  I feel the need to share with you the aftermath of my meal choice .  The Bologna bit me back  at around midnight. The word Fire comes to mind, Not just your average heartburn situation- this burned EVERYWHERE. And it hung on. Three Zantacs, and a night of getting to know my hotel throne and Todd English and his meat were still with me. It took me almost the next twenty four hours to feel well again and it made for a rather rough last day in Vegas ( sorry to the hotel janitorial staff). I wish I could honestly say that I will not hold it against the P.U.B, but I probably will. I can tell you for a fact my Bologna days are over.  Even doing this review today my stomach turns just a bit at the memory.  Maybe someday I will go back to the P.U.B , but who knows?

So, Friday morning, we got our bets in and headed to find a comfortable place to get something to eat and watch some games. Walking around, we ended up at Todd English P.U.B., which had everything we wanted; seats at the bar, breakfast options, and TVs showing the games. This was one spot, I was glad we stopped in, I had one of the best bloody mary's, ever, spicy, with the right mix of vodka (Hangar One) and tomato juice and the perfect garnish of pickled carrot and a block of cheddar cheese with some pickled string beans, all with a salt and peppered rim. Delightful. One of those babies and that's all I needed for the afternoon.  Breakfast was good but a little salty for my taste. There were a few brunch options, I got the bacon, egg, cheese sandwich (bacon on the side) and Gramercy Guy had the English breakfast, fried eggs, bacon, toast and beans. These beans were the show stealer. I traded my bacon for the beans and thinking about them now is making my mouth water. There was meat (I was told from the bar tender, it's what's ever left on the cutting board) with the right balance of smoky (probably from the meat) and sweet. Had I known how good the beans were, I would have swapped the fries I barely touched for more beans. And you know what they say about beans being for the heart. So really this was a perfectly balanced meal between the beans and the tomato juice.\n\nThe cool thing about Todd English P.U.B. is their drink challenge. Along the bar, there are many hour glasses that flip; they are timed for 7 seconds. The challenge: if you can drink a pint of beer before the time runs out, it's free. I knew I wasn't up for the challenge but watched many people around me do it, some more than once. Matt, the bartender, guessed that about 80% of the people who try actually succeed.\n\nTo see pictures and read more go to http://gramercygirl.blogspot.com/2012/03/todd-english-pub.html", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "We loved this place!

Prime beef, corned beef (my favorite), brisket, pastrami...you name it, they'll carve it fresh for you. Pick a choice of bread + sauces and you have yourself a meaty manwich. It's almost too good to be true.\n\nThey've also got a hefty collection of beers & beer cocktails. However, I stick to the girly stuff. I've had their bloody mary's, Bellinis, and their Grow A Pear cocktails...and I'm absolutely in love with the latter. Perfect hint of sweetness. Great as dessert actually.\n\nAs for the vibe, like I said earlier, it's never been busy when we've gone so I'm not sure how it is with crazy crowds...it is a pub, after all. I do love the layout though, it feels open and never congested; the bar is in the middle of the restaurant, like at Yardhouse. \n\nI've enjoyed this restaurant/pub each time we've gone.

I would not order them again for a meal, maybe a starter if you had 3 people. They were appetizer size in my opinion. They came w/ kettle chips which I let others at the table eat.

And almost stayed an extra day just to go again.  No joke.\n\nWhere do I start?\n7 Second Beer -- can you drink a pint in about 7 seconds?  If so, and if you pick one $10 or less it's free  Up to two per day.  Go with Boddington's or another nitrogen-charged beer.  It goes down more smoothly.  But don't break the glass when you slam it down on the bar.  The bartenders will hate you and you'll bleed everywhere.  Apparently this actually happens.\n\nPastrami -- best pastrami I've ever had.  Ever.  Best pastrami ever.  It is sinfully juicy yet not visibly or tactile-y {is that a word?} fatty.  Great peppery bark and just the best thing ever on rye with the horseradish and mustard trio.  The pickles that are served with it {cauliflower, cucumbers and such} are also incredible.  Not too tangy or salty.  OMFG  An 8 ounce portion is enough to share and share you should; you want to save room to try other stuff.\n\nPastrami burger -- one of the top three burgers I've ever had  It looked I seriously {seriously} thought my pescatarian fiance would break down and take a bite.  It was a perfect rare/mediurm rare and beautifully red in the middle  The flavor was outstanding and while it was topped with goodies, the meat really stood up on its own.  The fries with black truffle aioli were also great but were totally overshadowed by the burger\n\nMussels -- best mussels I've ever had.  Inappropriately good.  Like pornographic.  You get a huge pile of large, perfectly cooked, perfectly tasty oysters.  Not remotely chewy.  And the sauce - oh, the sauce!!!  Ask for extra bread to soak up the brothy, tomatoey goodness  Holy mother of all things delicious.\n\nPretzel stick thingies with cheese sauce -- came out piping hot and great for absorbing those ill-advised shots after making friends with every bartender in the house  \n\nFish and chips -- the best fish and chips we have ever had.  Again - not kidding  The fish {cod?] was huge.  Like over a foot long.  And probably three inches thick.  And beautiful and flaky and fresh and flavorful.  Served with fantastic cole slaw {different from the cole slaw with the lobster rolls???}.  And fat fries  de-freakin-licious.\n\nLobster rolls -- the \"worst\" food item we tried.  Meaning it wasn't the best or among the best of that item we had ever tasted.  Our only complaint was that it was too saucy.  Would have preferred to been able to taste more of the huge lobster pieces stuffed into the brioche style buns.  They came with great cole slaw.  Think KFC but way less mayonaissey and way fresher.\n\nBeer -- a freaking fantastic beer selection.  One of the top three I can think of in terms of scope, quality and size.  Don't know what you're doing?  Ask for a recommendation from the bartenders.  They know their trade  Maybe try a cask ale.  Nom nom nom.  Interested in Coors Light?  Go kill yourself.  Or you'll be the guy down the bar who was literally laughed at by the bartender.\n\nHappy hour -- whaaaaat?  They have two.  I think one is from 4-7 and the other is from 10 - ???  Half price drafts.  This means you can get outstanding beers are very reasonable prices  $1 wings, $2 oysters and $3 sliders.  The oysters are always $2, but whatever  The wings were fairly small but very tasty and served with a chunky blue cheese.  The oysters were also not huge, but of good quality and served with some of the hottest horseradish I have ever had.  And also with straight up seaweed, son.  Eat it.  The slider was a good size and high in quality.  Also not cooked to a crisp.  I dipped it in my leftover wing blue cheese.  Awww yeah.\n\nBartenders -- they are GREAT here.

No brine-y or sweet burst of flavor. The cocktail sauce was good, but I think a good oyster needs to be able to stand on its own.\n\nLobster Roll ($24) - Soft, toasty and buttery texas toast.

K was told that the tuna burger was life-changing, N got the lobster rolls, our friend got a salad and I went with the caprese salad. While lots of things sounded good it was kind of hot and I just wanted to have something cold and light. We ordered an order of sweet potato fries for the table and Lauren had some honey mustard mixed up for us (thanks!). \n\nWe were blown away by the fantastic beer menu. Like wow. From favorites to things we can't get in Michigan but have wanted to try to things we've never heard of there was a vast selection that was organized beautifully on the back of our menu. \n\nEveryone loved their food and all but our friend who was working and our exchange student enjoyed two beers. \n\nThe lobster rolls were voted best at the table and my caprese salad, while beautifully presented, came in last. The tomatoes just had no flavor. I'm not sure if it's not tomato season in Vegas or what but they were crazy bland. However, I can deal with such a little difference between best and worst when the best is so damn good (and had the toms been better my food would have been excellent). \n\nWe will definitely come back here the next time we're in Vegas.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "A good choice for happy hour on the Strip (half off drafts, $1 wings, $2 oysters, $3 sliders from 3-6pm and 10-midnight).\n\nThe whole menu looked pretty good, but since we had late dinner plans I limited myself to only things on the happy hour menu. The sliders and oysters were the most impressive: the oysters were fresh and served with several sauces and the sliders tasted much better than your average run of the mill hamburger. The wings were pretty disappointing, very little meat and a buffalo sauce that could have easily come out of a jar.

This place is a gimmick. But that's to be expected when visiting an \"English Pub\" in a casino. Let's get to the pro's and con's.\n\nPro's: the grilled brie and bacon sandwich was very good. My wife's grilled chicken with avocado sandwich also looked very good. Come to think of it, every meal I saw pass us looked very decent.\n\nCon's: No getting around it, the place is supremely over-priced. Typical pint is $11.00. While drinks are expensive in Vegas, this is at the upper-end in terms of cost. Most places in Vegas serve a pint of microbrew for $7.00 to $8.00 (and one place in Palazzo had happy hour pints for $3.00). But you are going to a pub with a large selection of beers, so arguably your premium beer price is going towards having that giant beer selection. \n\nThe service is also leaves a lot to be desired. Our waiter immediately gave us a bad case of the douche chills. I ordered a pint of the cask-conditioned black butte porter and my wife ordered a pint of Magic Hat No. 9. After ordering, he went into this long story about how much he loved Magic Hat No. 9 but wishes he could find it in bottles because in his opinion bottled beer was so much better than draft. According to our waiter, the draft just seemed to \"change the flavor of the beer.\" We thought this was a strange comment because nobody has ever tried to sell me on the idea that bottled beer is better than draft. We didn't think anything of it for the moment.\n\nThen after he brings our beers, my wife sips her beer and comments that this beer is way stronger than Magic Hat No. 9. Magic Hat No. 9 is probably a 5.5% ABV wheat beer. She then let me sip the beer to confirm. Instead of Magic Hat No. 9, the beer was a Belgian Trippel like Chimay White. Personally, I would prefer the Chimay White to a No. 9, but my wife didn't want to start her lunch with a 9% ABV beer and wanted something light like the No. 9. \n\nWhen we explained to the waiter that the beer he brought wasn't No. 9, he tried to convince us that we were wrong. If he had left it at that, we wouldn't have really had a problem because, at the end of the day, we are on vacation, and it's just a beer. We can always grab a beer somewhere else. He then tries to convince that it's the draft mechanism that has changed the flavor. He says that the previous beer on that same tap was a Cider and that the Cider \"residue\" combined with the Magic Hat No. 9 changed its flavor to a Belgian Trippel. Then he starts smiling and says, \"see, I told you that the bottles are better than the tap,\" as if he were bringing his whole bottle full-circle with this experience.\n\nBottom line: We left with the impression that this guy knew they were out of Magic Hat No. 9 but assumed we were too stupid to know the difference between No. 9 and a Belgian Trippel. \n\nBottom line: my lunch was good, but the service was kind of weird. And it's a little bit cheesy, but that is to be expected in Vegas. For the money, there are better offerings on the strip. I prefer the Public House in the Palazzo.

Nearly a century later I would share in this tradition on the famous Las Vegas Strip in Todd English Pubb.\n\n  From 3 to 6 PM and 10 to Midnight, Todd English P.U.B., holds a Happy Hour. Pints of beer and glasses of wine are half priced. Wings are $1. And oysters are $1. In my opinion, the appetizer Happy Hour specials are a bit misleading. A $1 for seven chicken wings will come up to $7. Not a bargain at all.\n\n  In this fast-paced world that I live in, I partake in Happy Hour to be happy. Todd English P.U.B., features a major selection of beers to choose from to be happy. The categories include craft beers, fruity beers, the big boys, and so on. I usually get one to three beers. When I entered this thriving restaurant and pub located between Crystals and the Aria all uptight and exhausted from work, I make a beeline to the center bar. By the time I drink the pint of Fruli strawberry for example, I am becoming happy. After the pint of Arrogant Bastard Ale I am happy. And once I cash in my Yelp free check-in offer for a free Bud Light and drink it, I am OFF THE CHARTS HAPPY.\n\n  The reality is that Todd English P.U.B., is an upbeat establishment that feeds off all the positive energy on the Las Vegas Strip. The majority of the patrons are tourists without a care in the world but to have a good time. After an Arrogant Bastard Ale and Bud Light, I kind of develop this tourist state of mind. I feel like I am part of a big party. Every so often in this party, the bar tender will ring a bell. This is to call attention to the fact that somebody is getting a complimentary drink for quaffing a beer down within seven seconds. Maybe one day after a stressed out shift I could write a review update on drinking a beer in less than seven seconds.\n\n  Being in City Center, Todd English P.U.B.,fills up fast. This will cause some delay in the partaking of Happy Hour when all the bar stools are taken and the bar tenders are busy. \n\n  At Todd English P.U.B., it is more than the names of some of the beers that are weird. What is kind of weird, or just so out of the ordinary in Vegas is that men and women share the same sinks. If you are going on a date and plan to freshen up, I would advise another restroom. \n\n   Happy Hour is a tradition that I am so going to continue to partake in. And I am happy to say that when I am in City Center with the urge for a cold one or two between 3 and 6 PM, that the odds are in my favor of partaking in another Todd English P.U.B., Happy Hour.\n\n***The Daniel.

I finally made up my mind and went with Chicken Tacos ($16), the description made them sound flavorful and delicious and didn't let me down.  The chicken tacos come 3 to an order with a crock or rice and beans.  The shells were good; soft shells and held up well against the moist chicken meat and salsa.  The chicken was so moist and well seasoned, I thoroughly enjoyed every bite of it and could have eaten even more.  The rice and beans were presented mixed in a crock and were good with a bit of spice as well.   After two glasses of cider and the tacos, my bill totaled $41.

I know there were a couple other times I had the intention of going, but decided on other restaurants in City Center or Aria. It was good, not amazing, and not enough to compete with new restaurants and bars popping up in the last three years with similar menus and/or themes.\n\nI know a lot of people say this and it's a tad clich\u00e9, but I really wanted to like this place again. My brother, Marcus L., fianc\u00e9, Teresa S., and I were leaving Zarkana and decided to stay in City Center to eat/avoid traffic. Since I was the only one in the group to have been to PUB, it seemed to be the perfect spot. We were seated right away and pleasantly surprised that we were there for the start of Happy Hour (their second Happy Hour is 10pm to closing daily)! It features $1 Chicken Wings, $2 Oysters, $3 Sliders, and 1/2 off pint draft beers and glasses by the wine. We decided on 10 sliders and an order of Waffle Fries ($8) for the group. My fianc\u00e9 and I both ordered a pint of Fr\u00fcli Strawberry beer ($6 during H/H) while I got a Caesar Salad ($12) and he got Bangers & Mash ($18). \n\nThe service was...interesting. We weren't entirely pleased, but fortunately, it wasn't horrible. It was just odd. Our server just assumed we knew what Happy Hour entailed (to our defense, the little 1/4 paper doesn't explain details) so we were forced to ask multiple questions and follow-up questions. Which would have been fine, but after answering one question, the server would immediately say, \"I can come back if you need more time,\" leaving us with, \"Um, um, well, uh\" and trying to quickly phrase our next question. It was so uncomfortable! But, other than our ordering experience, the service was good throughout the meal. The person who brought out the food was really nice and our server came to check on us three times.\n\nThe food was extremely prompt, so that was great. The Sliders were only shrug-worthy. They were flavorless with a sad amount of caramelized onions (some seeming almost non-existent) and barely enough Thousand Island dressing. Also, only some of our order were cooked Medium Rare, like we requested. The Waffle Fries were delicious, but I can't give a restaurant much credit for something that came out of a bag/box then fried, especially at $8. My Caesar Salad was decent (didn't love the dressing), but made me extremely sad having paid $12 for the small bowl. Not worth it AT ALL. The Bangers & Mash were just okay as well. The sausages were okay, but the mash was weird. It had large chucks of potatoes on the bottom that resembled a kind of hash, then a small amount of mashed potatoes on top of it, then the gravy and sausages. The description doesn't describe the potato chucks, so perhaps it was an odd part of the gravy? So, mysterious substandard potatoes that took away from the dish, got it. No one was really impressed.\n\nOur bill was just under $100 (tax and tip included), ouch. When you consider the type of eateries in the valley that serve superior tastes at much lower prices, it's hard to consider this worthwhile.\n\nAs for the Happy Hour deals, I'm not sure if the wings are truly cheaper than a regular order and the oysters are EXACTLY the same price you'd pay outside H/H (it doesn't even leave anything to the imagination because the menu literally says $2 each). And the sliders are basically the same price as the regular order, unless you don't want fries (the regular order, $16, comes with three sliders and skinny fries, $8 as a side order).

We were staying at the Aria and weren't yet ready to head to the airport and so decided on this place.  What was nice is that whenever I checked in here on Yelp I got a check-in offer for a free bud light.  While I am not in any way a bud light fan and often avoid it, I love anything free and so eagerly accepted my beer.  Since it was a nice day we decided to sit outside and so I cant really comment on any of the decor inside of the restaurant.\n\nFor lunch my fiance and I decided to start off our meal by splitting the fried pickles appetizer.  We were pleasantly surprised by the mound of pickle chips that came out and were also impressed by the choice of three dipping sauces: a BBQ, a Blue cheese and my favorite, a spicy sauce.   The pickles were fried nicely and had a good crisp to them and I enjoyed pairing them with the different sauces.  For my lunch entree I decided to go with the Caesar salad after a week of gluttonous eating while my fiance decided on the lobster Cobb salad.  She was nice enough to let me enjoy two of the claws and the lobster was good being sweet, tender and seasoned perfectly.  My Caesar salad was decent sized although I was a little confused whenever it came out topped with tomatoes.  Yes it helped dress up the presentation but I have never seen tomatoes on a Caesar salad before.  The salad was also loaded with dressing which I personally love but know that many do not.  It tasted decent enough but wasn't anything terribly exciting, not that I was expecting it to be.\n\nThe bottom line from me is that I would head back here again in the future.

There's a convenient over pass, but let me tell you, the restaurant is situated in a little nook in the mall, so make sure you keep your eyes open!  Once you get in the place, you'll notice the round circular lamp chandeliers.  The lighting is a bit dim and offers a romantic/intimate setting.  One of the immediate focal points is the seafood bar.  When I went there, not much of the seafood was displayed, rather a bunch of crushed ice.  We were sat in the back where you say a cool exposed brick wall.  You got to see the expediter station and where the food was being cooked!  I love exposed kitchens.  It contributes to the intimate type setting, like you have a personal chef! Our servers name was Corey.  He was a cool guy, really nice and accommodating.  He checked on our table once in a while and didn't breathe down our neck which was very much appreciated.\n\nSome restaurants provide a basket of bread before the meal.

Heads up, if you check in to Yelp, you get a free 12oz glass of light beer!  I got that too :) LOL. For dinner, I got the New Amsterdam burger for $18.  This burger is a 10oz beef patty, shaved pastrami, kraut, Swiss cheese, picklelilly and fatty fries.  I got the patty medium rare which was perfectly cooked, the shaved pastrami was nice and salty.  I asked for the kraut on the side, but should had it on the burger like it came.  Offered a tangy element and a light crunchy texture to the burger.  The fatty fries were little wedges, nothing groundbreaking but they did give a lot!\n\nAt the end of the day, the place was better than OK.

The lobster they use doesn't have a genuine sweetness to it and they load it with lobster claws, which in my opinion, lacks flavor and texturally is off-putting.  For what it was it was decent, but being that it was DROWNING in mayo turned me off.  Lobster is rich as is, so let the lobster speak for itself.  For certain they do not use maine lobster (a more traditional lobster roll approach) because as I mentioned, the sweetness was greatly lacking.\n\nSliders - Definitely get these with the truffle mayo.

We were obviously not a priority to him by any means. This was very clear when I watched him pick up my drinks from the bar for a moment, place them back down, pick up another party's, and walk out onto the dining floor. This was also very clear when he served us our appetizer before finally retrieving our drinks. Wtf? Is he new? No restaurant I've ever been to has thought that was the acceptable order service. I highly doubt that one founded by Todd English would feel differently.\n\nMy appetizer of fried pickles was also ridiculously soggy. So much so that even though I was very hungry, I ate two bites and couldn't bring myself to take another. Sitting under the heating lamps too long while my server socialized with other, more familiar, patrons? That's my best guess.\n\nFinally, when I decided I'd had enough of P.U.B. for one lifetime, I ended up having to tell the bartender I wanted my check - minus the nasty pickles - because the server had put my table on ignore. It was like he thought, \"Hey, they got their drinks and pickles. What else could they want?\" He actually walked past once without a glance since setting down the drinks, but that was all I had seen of him for 10-15 minutes. Again, no restaurant I've ever been to has thought it acceptable for a server to not ask how everything is shortly after serving it. But perhaps I've been living on a different planet, or in the Twilight Zone or something...who knows...\n\nTo summarize: This place sucks. With all the places to get a drink and bite to eat just in Aria alone, I don't understand why anyone would ever go here unless by mistake; like me. Don't be fooled about this restaurant, people.

Inside, there is an enormous bar surrounding a huge wall of alcohol, with drinks, food and other specials listed on blackboards. They also have an hour glass rotator spaced evenly throughout the bar seating, but more on that later. \n\nThe place has 70 different types of beer on hand from various regions, including Belgium and the United States, along with Trappist beer made by monks. \n\nWhile there are other locations in Vegas that offer 100, any beer aficionado will find something they like. However, the star of the show in my opinion is the TE Bloody Mary. It's probably the best BM I've had in a long time, with a generous amount of spice and kick to really get the senses going. It comes with a variety of accouterments, including pickled carrots, green beans, olives and cheddar cheese. This drink is a nice beverage and meal rolled into one. I would recommend this to anyone stopping by here, it's that good!\n\nThe food on the other hand is hit or miss. While they claim to have a raw bar, I felt it really missed the mark, with the oysters improperly shucked and not very fresh. It was the biggest disappointment as I am a huge fan and was hoping to have something close to satisfy that craving. \n\nI also ordered their hot dog, which was okay. Look wise, it's a beast, at a whopping  foot long (possibly bigger) and more than enough for two people. The dog was split a third of the way down to fill it with cheddar cheese which was a nice touch. The brioche bun also took this American staple to a higher level but that's where it really ends. While the bun was nice and soft, the meat to bread ratio was grossly off, opting for big and large presentations over taste. The sausage also didn't have the kind of snap I was looking for. It may have been different with the chili and onion option but I don't think another $5 addition to an already expensive meal ($20) was worth it. \n\nNot bad by any means but definitely not great. \n\nThe hour glass at the bar however, is super interesting, especially if you are coming with friends. The 7 second hour glass challenge allows daredevils to down a beer before the sand runs out. Those that are successful get their beer for free and you can do this twice a day.

After seeing the menu on the outside of the door, we were anxious to see if the food was as good as it sounded. \n\nOn first approach, the hostess was extremely pleasant and very kind. She sat us immediately at a booth along the wall. Our waitress, I think her name was Hayleigh, came to our table to take our drink order and my fiance and I both ordered drinks from the bar. I ordered the white sangria and he ordered a Manhattan. Our drinks took approximately 20 minutes to come to the table and when the server brought them out to the table, she made an excuse about the bartender being new and walked away. This did not bother us much except for the fact that we probably would have ordered 2nd drinks if they had not taken so long! \nBefore she brought the drinks, the server asked if we were ready to order and seemed inconvenienced when I mentioned that we would like to order an appetizer. However, we ordered the mussels and they were really delicious. Our food came out before we were finished with the appetizer. I ordered the Lobster Rolls and my fiance ordered the RIbeye. My Lobster Rolls were delicious. i cannot express how much I loved them. Definitely a must try if you happen to want to try this place out. My fiance's ribeye was cooked well, however the potato wedges that came with it were cold and soggy. By this time, both of our waters have been empty for a good 15 minutes. Once we finally got our servers attention, she was annoyed when we explained to here that the wedges were cold.\nDuring this time, the table in front of us was complaining to the manager about their food taking a long time, and the manager was a complete jerk about it to them. Both my fiance and I are servers and we have never witnessed worse customer service. The manager was rude and condescending and told the table that they were lying about their food taking a long time, and said \"What do you want me to do about it?\" \nFor this reason, we chose not to speak with the manager because of how rude we saw him being. We then asked our server, who we have seen only 3 times all night to box up our food, because we just wanted to leave. \n\nWorst service I have ever experienced. I will never go back. I cannot believe a place with this reputation allows their management to treat customers so badly. My fiance and I have friends who live in Las Vegas and we travel here at least once a year.

I ordered the avocado on the side since I'm allergic. OMG. This was sooooooooo good. Although they spread the wasabi aioli on a bit unevenly and I teared up on some bites into my burger, it didn't distract me from the amazing taste and texture of this unique burger. There is a layer of black bean puree that brought everything together. The buns were lightly toasted and the arugula marinated to complement everything else.\n\nBrown butter lobster rolls - came with kettle chips and coleslaw. We split our entrees so I got a whole lobster roll to myself (it comes with three). My goodness, this was one buttery and rich lobster roll. The browned butter is such a genius idea. The lobster pieces were generous and not heavily saturated in mayo. I love how they kept the chunks of lobster big instead of dicing them smaller to make a filler out of mayo. It really kept things fresh and gave me nice chewing action. I tasted the coleslaw and it was pretty good. My mom is not fond of coleslaw, but she polished it off. The chips were just kettle chips, nice crunch, not overly salted.\n\nSERVICE\n\nService was okay. It's what I expected for a bar/pub type restaurant. Nothing great, nothing bad.

The idea of making their own black pudding, for example, is tremendous, but it's just not very tasty, which is a huge shame.\n\nThe restaurant is quite stylish (we only briefly looked in to the bar, which looked fairly similar) and the waiters and waitresses are lovely, but it has some way to go before it's producing dishes that are really going to impress.\n\nSo overall, we said: \"Blackfriars has some work to do to improve how the various elements of their dishes come together. There's no reason why they can't do that, though, given the quality of ingredients they're sourcing, so I look forward to seeing how things progress. For now, the place is smart and the service very good, but the food is very likely to divide opinion.\"", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I really only have come here for drinks.

Overall it was lovely! Not one of us had a food option that didn't go down well.\n\nMy starter of pumpkin gnocchi, wild mushrooms and a sage and Parmesan butter was scrummy! Forks from the other members of the table immediately pointed in my direction (ironic considering they all poo-pooed the vegetarian starter option initially!). The gin cured sea trout, buttermilk pancakes and caviar also got a thumbs up from my boyfriend however as an avid fish and seafood hater there was no way I could sample. 3 of the party were tempted by the baked eggs, ham hough & sauteed greens - soft & tasty. The winner however was definitely the gnocchi! \n\nFor the main, I was really disappointed to hear that the partridge was off as the supplier had ran out. However it had been replaced with pheasant. Having salivated over the menu for weeks, I'd really gotten my hopes up on sampling partridge which I hadn't eaten before... grrr...however, I was assured the pheasant was equally as nice. Hmmmm...not sure..... the meat itself was slightly tough for my liking and had quite a lot of blood vessels through it which turned my stomach a bit. The actual foot (yes foot, claws and all!!) hanging off the end of the pheasant leg put me off a bit too... however I'm a wimpy, squeamish person, not used to eating game meat. It genuinely didn't bother my Mum who had the same dish. \n\nI was delighted to find my main accompanied by the obligatory Christmas sprouts - cooked perfectly, with some additional raw sprout shells sprinkled on top!. There was a gorgeously textured, creamy chestnut puree and perfectly balanced ju, with some unidentifiable crunchy nutty flakes on top which actually turned out to be shaved raw chestnut - drooooolllll..... The baked Jerusalem artichokes replaced the usual side of potato and it worked! The texture was amazing....sooo good in fact my brother went out and bought some artichokes to cook with our Xmas dinner. For the sides alone, this dish got a huge thumbs up from me.\n\nThe rest of my party chose the poached ling (some kind of meaty white fish similar to the texture of monkfish) with cockles, brown butter & sea herbs and the rib eye steak with chips (slightly oversalted) and b\u00e9arnaise sauce. Cleared plates across the table!\n\nFor dessert I opted for the apple and almond tart with mulled wine sorbet  - lovely tart but I'm not a fan of sorbet in general and this was no exception. The blue murder blue cheese and ale cake went down well although we had a split opinion at the table on the bread which was spiced and dense and resembled too much like a cake. Some liked it with the cheese, some didn't. I actually had a similar view with the 'treacle soda' bread offered at the beginning - tasted too much like a treacle scone. I'm in the camp that wants savoury bread with my meal! Stop experimenting with the bread Mr Chef! :)\n\nThe service was excellent and the Australian (?) waitress was very attentive and friendly. It wasn't busy, which on the last sat before Xmas I was actually surprised at, however it must be the location. Like Michael Neave (another one of my rated places) it wont get much passing traffic.

But it was perfect nonetheless, so no marks lost.

In good weather, you can even sit outside but we've never been here when it's been cool (or non-windy) enough to do so. \n\nThe owner used to be the general manager of Fado Irish Pub on Eastern before it (sadly) closed and has brought much of the quality food preparation and wide beer and spirits selection along with him to this now British-predominant place. One of the best aspects in the bar area is one of those personal tap-tables with riser seats that allows you and 4-5 of your friends to pour your own Guinness or Harp while it keeps track of the pints drawn (and very accurately, too, down to the 100th decimal point!) Service has been good each time we've gone, too- not hovering but close by if you need something. \n\nThe food is definitely of good quality, the presentation is great and not that expensive for the portion size and quality. The fish and chips portion is large and very good, the Shepherd's Pie is well-made and presented, bangers and mash are traditionally served and the corned beef sandwich is not made from sliced, round corned beef logs like at some other places, but from a true, uneven brisket piece. And did I mention the traditional British breakfast with all the right sausages and baked beans? They also have great hamburgers and salads, ideal for those who want British/Irish alcohol but not the cuisine that goes along with it (their loss, in my opinion...we've never had a bad meal of traditional British food here.)  \n\nThe ambience could be better, which is why it only gets four stars. Shakespeare's was not the first tenant of this space and they seem to have inherited a large portion of the old tables/chairs and room design, not all of which makes it look much like a British pub except for some posters and Guinness/Harp advertisements on the walls. But the casual tables-and-chairs set-up has its advantages if you have a group of friends who want to watch sports on any of their many TV's, for example, and the brickwork on some of the pillars gives it a bit of an Old World feel.\n\nAll in all, if you miss the old Fado (either on Eastern or when it was in Green Valley Ranch years ago), this is not a bad replacement.

It WILL take you two hours to get three rounds of drinks on a good night.  Err, while I'm at it, I may as well mention parking as well.  I have only lucked out twice with parking at this place, and that was only because I pulled up as someone was pulling out.

My friends and I love this place for every reason you could love a pub.  Crown is super cozy and completely raucous at the same time!

If you're feeling adventurous, the bartender and *some* of the wait staff are very knowledgeable and will happily recommend something to quench what you're thirstin' fer.  \n\nIf sitting around outside with a smoke, a beer, and a group of friends at a great pub isn't enough excitement for you, inside they have darts, video poker, and several televisions for your pubbing pleasure.

I guess I find it too English at times, especially when there's a big boxing fight in town, it's full of Brits singing shite songs and being obnoxious, something I don't miss about living in England!\n\nAll in all, a decent place probably mostly because of the atmosphere and beer selection (the Guinness isn't that great there by the way), but in my mind somewhat over-rated.\n\nOh, and to Susan R.  it's NOT the same thing as the 'Rose and Crown' you mentioned... that's kind of like saying a Geo Metro is the same as a Cadillac because they're both American cars!", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I made my first, but hopefully not last, stop into the C&A Wednesday week whilst on business in LV.\n\nIt can be difficult at times in a big city to find local hangouts, however I fortunately have a UK mate living here who had already sussed the place out and found it up to his British pub standards.

And let's be honest here, whoever came up with their uniforms, you deserve a medal.\n\nBut it is the food we are interested in.\n\nThe wife went for the Sunday Dinner with roast beef, I had the Sunday dinner with lamb and beef, both dishes are served with Yorkshire pudding, veg and A roast potato (more on those in a minute), along with this my wife ordered a small house salad.\n\nAfter a while we had pretty much given up on the salad, no big deal, these things do happen. however, when are meals came out, they each had a house salad on the plate, along with the meat, potatoes, veg, Yorkshire pudding and gravy.....\n\nA pet peeve of mine is when waitstaff know that something isn't right, how a house salad, with gravy even makes it out of the kitchen is beyond me (unless this is the way the owners want it, in which case....WOW).\n\nAnyways, a quick recovery by the lady serving us, my salad which I did not order is gone and my wife has a nice house salad on the side, which would have been better served before the meal came out, but ok, on to the meal itself.\n\nIs it a \"traditional British Sunday dinner\", well yeah it is, in the same way that as a McDonald's 1/4 pounder is a gourmet burger, all the pieces are correct, it looks right, but there is just something missing.\n\nSo let us dissect the meal :\n\nThe meats were good, maybe a little thinly sliced, but that happens to be the way I like them, so I was happy, however, putting beef gravy on to lamb just destroys any taste to the meat, if you are going to offer both meats, it's actually better to serve the gravy on the side and let the customer mess it up.\n\nThe Yorkshire pudding was good, this is something that normally causes all kinds of issues to those not raised with the darn things, but they were good.\n\nVeg is veg, enough said and ignored.\n\nNow for the real crime on this dish, the roast potato.....This is going to be long, it is a story and a rant.\n\nThe Great British Roast Potato, a food that when done right makes a Brit smile and a non Brit wish they had been born a Brit, sounds like exaggeration huh ? \n\nA couple of years ago we were lucky enough to host the family Christmas dinner here, it seemed like half of California showed up, the women folk worked their wonders on the veg, the father in law worked on turkey and prime rib.\n\nOver in a corner of the kitchen the Brit who married into the family was hiding in a cloud of steam, gently giggling to himself, these poor Americans had no idea what was about to hit them. A bag of potatoes had been boiled, cut in half and were now being gently rocked back and forth in a colander.\n\nThe women were looking at the wife wondering, WTF did you go and marry this guy for ? And why won't he answer any questions about what he is cooking ?\n\n45 minutes before we are due to eat, the potatoes are placed in the oven, set at 325, basting in a bath of melted lard and drippings. After 15 minutes the oven door is quickly opened, the potatoes are quickly covered with the oil, 15 minutes later the door is again opened and the potatoes are turned over.\n\nSo 45 minutes pass, what comes out is a potato that is golden brown on the outside with a crispness to it while inside the potato is light and fluffy.... And totally ignored by everyone ! Heretics !\n\nThat is until the father in law becomes brave and decides to try one of these strange things his new son in law has produced.... Or it could of been his daughter kicking him under the table while not so subtly nodding at the bowl of potatoes, but he tries one, then ever so slowly reaches over and grabs the bowl and shovels a bunch of them on to his plate, the family is shocked, the strange new food is a hit with the old man, the Brit sits back with a little smile on his face.\n\nNow the reason for that long story is...... If you are going to serve roast potatoes serve roast potatoes, not two little bits of potato that if I had to guess came out of a bag frozen, were quickly thrown through some oil and then put on a plate and served.\n\nYes doing it right is time consuming, yes it can be a bit of a pain, but if a chain in the UK can do it day in and day out serving thousands of meals a day,there is no reason why a little restaurant cannot get such an important part of the meal right.\nFor this reason and this reason alone they get marked down, is that mean, well no it's not.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 5, "useful": 8, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Pretty good, but there's a reason the Brits aren't known for their food.

Now, it's like a revolving door of rude staff.  We sat at the bar while this big, buff, rude a-hole was more concerned with chatting up some girls and we waited 20 minutes for him to take our order as we just put $300 in the slot machine.  He looked right at us, so I KNOW he knew we were there.  He finally took our order and then tried to charge us for them.  I didn't want to be a brat about it and bring up the slot comps, so we just paid rather than deal with it.  Then he dissappeared somewhere in the back.  We had to leave and had just hit a jackpot and seriously waited another 15 or so minutes until he came back, and then he shut off the beeping from the machine and walked right over to the girls and ignored us for another 10 minutes while he put a couple hundred dollars in the machines and gambled himself!!!  I had to actually walk to the other side of the bar to ask him if we could please cash out and he finally helped us, but what a douche.

It's always high on a lot my friend's lists of dive bars along with Frankie's Tiki Room, the Double Down, etc, but those recommendations are typically more for drinks and overall ambiance than food. This is why I was particularly skeptical about this one, even with a few friends swearing by it. Needless to say, I ate it and was more than surprised.\n\nThe pub is located on the east side of Tropicana in an iffy area of town, but you're not coming here for the class. The interior is decked out with British-inspired street signs, posters of boats and the like, with the waitresses wearing skimpy kilt outfits. There's also an outdoor patio which I've heard is dog friendly. I was fully expecting an overly loud, smoky bar scene that would have made eating a bit unsavory, but it was surprisingly quiet on the Saturday night we were there. The menu features all sorts of traditional British dishes that I've heard are hard to find at other locations around town. This is all good, but I only really care about burgers for the sake of this review so I'll have to try some of that other wacky stuff on my next visit.\n\nThe British Burger on their menu comes with a  1/2 pound patty, bacon, lettuce and tomato and choice of a few cheeses. My burger had great char flavor upon first bite, which carried all the way through. It was cooked a bit more than medium-rare but I was ok with it due to the overall great flavor. It was greasy for the first half, dried up a bit in the second half but was still ok because of the flavor. My bacon wasn't quite as cooked as I would have liked, but it still had decent flavor. The thin onions were good but I still pulled them off as to not overpower the great flavor I was experiencing. The lettuce and tomato were fresh, although the tomato was a little sparse, and the swiss cheese was melted and good as well. The bun was soft, gooey and delicious, and was very well proportioned to meat. Overall this was an excellent burger that I wasn't expecting at all.\n\nWhile I typically don't care for them, my steak fries were actually really good; they were cooked well for the most part but there were a few soggy ones in there.  My side pickle slices were good too; they never made it onto my burger but I still ate them. At $9.25 with fries this is very reasonably priced; combine that with a beer or three and you're in for a good time.

All the happy hour apps were $2 a piece. Pretty sweet price. We got $3 glasses of Newcastle Werewolf beer. Never had that before and it was a very good brew. \n\nHappy hour apps: \n\nWe got the beef sliders which were different. The patties were battered and deep fried. It was certainly juicy but then again how could a deep fried hamburger patty be any other way? I prefer regular sliders though. Do Brits really do it this way? \n\nGot a mini chicken pot pie and steak pot pie. These were decent. My wife preferred beef pot pie with ground beef but I liked it with a whole piece of steak. Good flavor and something I would definitely get again. \n\nThe chips were the most disappointing. They came with a curry dip that was too mild and watery. The fries were served so rare that we actually sent them back!! I have NEVER sent back fries in my life. And in a place that's supposedly British???? Unreal. 2nd batch of fries were acceptable but still very meh. \n\nThis place has lots of promise though. The breakfast menu looked yummy and the weekday lunch deal could be a knockout. For lunch, you get an entree and then for $5 more you can get all you can drink British beer. That sounds like a heckuva fun midday! They have a $10 bottomless offer for mimosa, bloody mary's and bellinis for breakfast but its only for 9am-11am.  Still decent and a better drink deal than anywhere else nearby.  Their Sunday roast which starts in a couple of weeks could be great too. \n\nThe English afternoon tea time is something that should be targeted to moms with kids or maybe guys that drink with their pinky sticking out.

I asked her if I could get hot tea instead of soda for the deal, which included two sodas, and she told me that would be perfectly fine, so I asked for an Earl Gray. Being hungry, I was a little bummed that no bread or other snack was offered, and it was a long time until we saw her again with an (iced) tea and even longer until we saw the appetizer.\n\nThis was the biggest disappointment of all--the appetizer had none of the \"British cheese\" promised on the menu, and when our server asked the kitchen for us about it they apparently looked at her like she was speaking Greek.

I never had it before so I was not prepared for the paste of horrible livery meat-ness that came sliced an inch thick on a poor overburdened little crostini. My husband went at it bravely but there just wasn't enough bread to allow him to eat all (or most) of it. The shrimp cocktail were a little bland and could have benefited from a little more of the paprika they'd used to season/decorate it, although the salmon crostini was deliciously salty and creamy.

It was pretty good. Everything was seasoned on it's own, and everything went together well when it was eaten together.\n\nAfternoon tea was alright. They have a decent selection of tea, including traditional teas such as Earl Grey & Jasmine - as well as offering some flavored teas, as well as higher end straight teas such as a Darjeeling Estate & Dragonwell. While I liked the selection of tea, I wasn't a big fan of the way it was brewed. It is loose leaf tea, and they put the leaves straight into the pot. As they give it to you, they offer a timer to help you know when your tea is done. The only problem is - there is no way of taking the leaves out when the tea is done brewing. Yes, your first cup of tea might be perfect. But the next two or three you can get out of the pot - are bound to be bitter and burnt, since the tea leaves just sit in the hot water, constantly brewing. Other than that - tea service was good. Scones were a bit too sweet for me to eat more than half of it - bu it was nice that they give you two. Finger sandwiches include a salmon/cream cheese, egg salad, & a cucumber/butter sandwich. I was a bit weird-ed out by the cucumber sandwich, but  maybe that's just me. \n\nWent for lunch this last Sunday. I got the Toad in the Hole. It was pretty good, but worth the price? Maybe not.

Spending an hour in a restaurant purely waiting isn't something I look forward to when going to eat. \n\nLastly, happy hour. Pretty good prices. They offer $10 pitchers of their English's beer. The beer wasn't anything fancy. The bartender compared it to Bud Light, but it tasted nothing like it. We ordered he fish n chip sliders, burger sliders, & cheese plate. The cheese plate was a big hit, fish was alright, and the burger patties were deep fried. None of us were expecting that surprise and none of us were too fond of it either. But hey, $5 sliders - good deal. \n\nAll in all, it's a place I've obviously liked, since I've been back 4 times in the course of a week in a half.

They didn't have hot tea on the menu, but Don asked them if they had any and the waiter/bartender just brought out the whole selection because he didn't have it memorized. They had: Earl Grey, Mint Melange, Dragonwell, Chamomile Citrus, Darjeeling Estate, Wild Blossoms & Berries, Orange Dulce, Wild Blackberries, and Spring Jasmine. It was a pretty awesome selection and Don went with the Spring Jasmine ($4.59 for a pot). I really wanted a cocktail so I ordered Hard Tea off their specialty cocktail menu, which really just tasted like iced tea, until the ice melted and I really tasted the vodka. . \n\nWhen the waiter came back with our drinks, I ordered one the Fish and Chip Sliders AND the Beef Burger Sliders. Don followed in suit. Yes, I was starving. I was excited to come home and all I ate that day was the peanuts on the flight. The thing that bothered me was that the waiter made us feel like total fatasses that didn't understand what we were ordering. Originally, I said \"I want two fish and chip sliders and two beef burger sliders.\" The waiter informed me that each order comes with two, so I told him I want one order of each then (again, 4 sliders). He explained twice that that would be four sliders. I knew what I ordered and I didn't need it repeated to me...He then proceeded to stop by with a plate of four sliders and showed it to me saying, \"See, this is what you would be getting in your order. It would be all of this.\" WTF! Yes, I KNOW what I ordered. I originally said I WANTED 2 fish and chip sliders and 2 beef burger sliders, but he seemed to think I couldn't count correctly for some reason. I understand that may have seemed like too much food, but seriously, I DO eat a lot and I even said, \"Yeah I know, I'm really hungry.\" It just bothered me that he felt the need to explain what I was ordering 2 times then bring a plate of sliders out just to SHOW me what I ordered. That was unnecessary, and frankly, it made me feel like he was insulting my intelligence. \n\nWhile our food was being prepared, I noticed Don trying to fish out the tea leaves from his tea. I told him it comes with a strainer so he could strain the tea while pouring it into the cup, but I realized he was trying to fish it out because there was no strainer in the actual tea pot, so his tea was getting very bitter by the minute. The waiter passed by and said, \"You know, it comes with the strainer so you don't have to try to strain the tea in the pot.\" We told him why we doing that and he said he understood, but I don't think he did because he didn't try to do anything to help that. Don's tea got so bitter that he couldn't even drink it anymore. The only good tea was what he poured into his cup right away. All the tea in the pot got spoiled with bitterness because the pile of leaves was just sitting in it. \n\nThe Fish and Chip Sliders were probably my favorite of everything we had. They were pretty unique and pretty damn good. The fish was very juicy on the inside and nice and crisp on the outside. They put the perfect amount of tartar sauce in it so that it wasn't overpowering, but complimented the fish very well. The beef sliders on the other hand, were very dry and plain. I had a hard time getting those to go down.\n\nOverall, if it wasn't for the service, I'd probably give this place 3 stars.

It took about 15 minutes for them to bring out the 3 tier tea stand with the goodies, so we just drank our tea during that time. I knew from my previous two visits I had to drink it fast because all the tea leaves (and there's a lot of them) are just floating in the pot and it doesn't get strained until you pour it into your cup, so it gets very bitter. After eating the sandwiches, which were a little dry, I was already feeling a little full, but I couldn't resist their delicious scones, cream, and jam. Their cream is homemade and so light and fluffy. My favorite mini dessert was probably the chocolate one with a hazelnut crunch.

My husband is something of a Bloody Mary connoisseur, so when I saw the blissful happiness spread across his face, I knew we had a winner. After we told Samuel, the best server ever, that the Bloody was phenomenal, he asked, \"Have you ever had one with gin?\" Why not? HOLY CRAP FANTASTICNESS. The mimosas? Nice color, not overly OJ'd and not too much champagne. Perfect...every time.\n\nNow the food! Bobby's Full English lasted almost 20 minutes on his plate. Normally he inhales his food, but because it was so perfectly done and delicious, he savored every bit. Eggs, bacon, Heinz beans, sausage, toast and mushrooms that made my mouth water. He added a side of hash browns just to make sure he was full. Loved every bite. The sirloin and eggs? FANTASTIC. For $5, I wondered what was going to come out on the plate. The sirloin? Slender, not fatty, not greasy, tender, moist, perfectly cooked medium rare, just delicious. The eggs, over easy (you can choose), when broken over the steak? Heaven! And oh those hash browns. Both of us loved those hash browns. They weren't the out of the bag hash browns or the diner hash browns (which are still good). These were freshly grated and YUM-O.

They gave me lots of tomato, maybe too much. The bun was just ok as well; it looked way better than it tasted with its grill marks and all, but was not well-proportioned to the meat as I had a lot left over.

It begins with their delicious, housemade chips, sliced and crisped bangers (sausages), onion gravy, and chunks of Devon hot chili cheddar.

Light and really great.\nBANGERS & MASH: These Cumberland sausages are just so yummy. Great crunch from the casing, nice spice, and just the perfect salty flavor. Their housemade mashed potatoes is wonderful - buttery and smooth.\nLONDON TAG: Tagliatelle pasta with creamy, cheddar sauce, topped with Cumberland sausage slices and English peas. I recommend the smaller portion since the sauce can be a little on the \"heavier\" side, but still delicious.\nCOTTAGE PIE: Well-seasoned ground beef in a traditional pie with Lincolnshire cheddar mash baked on top.

The patio seating area itself is run down, and everything needs a fresh face. Fabric staples go a long way! No matter, I was there for the food. In the way of drinks, my companion ordered a beer and I got a Pimms cup. What arrived was some sort of bastardized version of the cocktail I love so dearly. There were giant fruit chunks in it which were so out of place, and a sparse 3 or so tiny pieces of ice on top that were quickly melting away. The drink wasn't even cold. It took about 15 minutes for our server to reappear at which point I asked if I could get something else instead because I really wasn't digging it. He left the drink which I hadn't touched on the table (which means I'm still paying for it) and brought me their house brew which he described as \"like Budweiser.\" He wasn't wrong- it was exactly like Budweiser but with that sort of rusty taste that I associate with English beers. Not a fan of that either.\n\nSo the drinks? Total bust. But the food was even worse. We ordered two appetizers which took 45min to come out. These appetizers were a cheese dip, and smoked salmon crostinis. How could it have taken that long?!\n\nThe cheese dip hit the table with a thick layer of skin over the top- already unappetizing. The grilled bread that came with it was tasty, but the cheese itself was gross. Bitter from the ale and bell peppers with no real cheesiness.. You could tell this was mostly a cornstarch concoction.\n\nThe smoked salmon was inedible to me. The \"crostinis\" were just sliced bread, not toasted or baked. The salmon was described on the menu as creamy, so I figured it was Atlantic, but it was ridiculously orange with no fat content at all, and was rather stiff. There was a thin slice of rolled cucumber on top which was supposed to up the presentation, but was just awkward as there was so way to functionally eat that. \n\nOur server didn't check on us again for a long time, and by the time he did we were ready for the check.

The food was brilliant, they had a great selection of beers, grand cider on draught and the atmosphere seemed very low key.  It could either be a fun little pub or a fine dining establishment.\nIn the beginning the service seemed brilliant, we were taken care of and the food was grand.

One, two , three, and when the fourth set of guests departed sans assistance, we got worried.  The two servers were taking care of a party inside and seemed rather stressed.

We still left a sizeable tip for our party, and left a bit disappointed.  This place should thrive.\nWe had guests in town over the weekend, we offered to take them to the airport Saturday night.

We were hungry and didn't want to wait for our food.  Despite us saying that we'd not return to EQ, we knew it would dead.  We were right.  We entered the pub, weren't greeted and found it difficult to sit at the bar due to one of the waitresses chatting someone up in the aisle.  We sat down and the bartender told us that we couldn't order food because he didn't feel like remembering our order.  There was something off about him. He was seriously flung the menus and other items down.  He would be a good fit at Dick's last resort, I could call taco for him if he'd like.  \nHe took our order 14 minutes after, he asked for our order several times, got it wrong. We finally got our food and there was still something omitted. Once that was righted, he yelled down to me to see if my beer was okay.  We got the spinach dip, a cheese platter, salmon pasta, chips and curry, and a curry plate.  The dip was like water, we asked him if this was normal and he said no its usually less watery. The flavor was horrid, like milk with a splash of beer in it and the consistency of skim.  He said he'd get us a new one, we declined it, insisting that we have to go.  We waited to pay, he eventually returned again with another dip, that same dip we declined.  We paid and left.\nI see no reason why this place has such bad service.

I am more than willing to tolerate the inevitable chaos of small children, but I would like to enjoy a somewhat tidy and clean place to do it in. \n\nThe menu also caters to small things and this is also much appreciated. But the choices for beverages for little ones seemed to be exclusively ribena and sugar supplemented 'juice drinks.' Maybe I just caught them at the end of a busy week, but in looking for a wee snack there appeared to be more than a few items on offer that were pre-packaged sweets - not something I would expect in a cafe. \n\nSo, I am torn here.

Although the more traditional Shepard's pie with red wine gravy is my favorite flavor, there is now a Royal with Cheese, a Chicken Tikka Masala, and many more fun-filled pasties to try!  For those of you that have had a Pasty in England, this will not be what you are expecting because the Pasty here is much larger.  There are no side items served with it and you should expect it to be a just little smaller than a calzone.  Go without the expectation for traditional English fare and the Pasty will not disappoint!  Aside from the yummy pasties, the setting of The Cornish Pasty is cozy and fun.  The Jukebox there is awesome....playing everything, classic rock, psychedelic, new wave, etc.  At night, the lights grow dim and each table is candle lit.  They have a large patio that is currently being remodeled and a long indoor bar that overlooks the cooks prepping delicious pasties.  The staff is a charming and scenic tattooed hipster crowd that make the place seem young and alluring and there are nearly always bikes parked outside and pints being poured.

If you go you may want to check out the menu online beforehand or be prepared to browse the menu for awhile.  Our choice was the steak & cheese and one filled with sausage.  Both were incredible.  On the side, we had a choice of red wine gravy or mustard cream.  I asked our server which one she recommended and she said she would bring both.

If you're from northern Michigan, the pasty is nothing new to you. However, the pasties we grew up with are not the pasties they serve here. Dean has taken the idea of the traditional pasty and put a totally high end, almost gourmet twist into the mix. Look for southwestern and Greek flavors as well as traditional English and Italian pasties. The Oggie or O.G. is awesome.

I had never even heard of them until recently, when I read a review of this place.  Always the adventurous type when it comes to food, I figured I'd give it a shot.  How bad could it be?\n\nIt's fantastic.  At it's simplest, a pasty is a beautifully filled pastry with meat, potatoes, veggies and some sort of sauce.  Like a chicken pot pie without the tin.  But better.  Oh so much better.  And if chicken isn't your thing, fear not - they have pasties of pretty much anything you could imagine!  \n\nWe went this past Saturday to try it out.  I like the decor, cool black wall, love the church pews to sit at the communal tables - also a long bar or some small tables to sit at if communal seating isn't your bag, baby.  \n\nThe menu is quite extensive, a few pages worth of different pasties - a full page dedicated to vegetarian options (certainly not for me, but good to know!).  They have a nice drink menu as well, I suppose depending on what you're looking for.  They nod their head to the winos with a pretty limited selection (think there were 4 different types, nothing too spectacular).  The beer list is extensive, and perfect for the setting and menu.  Lots of american and english brews, quite the variety actually.  And with the draft beers you get a choice of 14oz, 20oz or 32oz.  All of them decently priced.  (For the record, I had a Boddingtons and it was delicious).\n\n$3 Irish car bombs, all the time.  (plus a couple other shot/drink specials) but that one jumped out at me.  \n\nTo the food.  I had the Oggie, which is described as the traditional pasty.  Steak, potatoes, onions and rutabaga with a red wine gravy.  It was brought to me with ketchup or more red wine gravy for additional moist-maker if you so choose.  It was great.  Steak was tasty, not too tough (i'm sure it's not filet mignon, but it was certainly good quality for a filler).  I'm still not sure what a rutabaga is, but I know I like it, at least in this dish!  Couldn't decide what I liked better the ketchup or gravy, so I went back and forth with each subsequent bite.  \n\nThe wife had the spicy Asiago Chicken.  Perfectly cooked chunks of chicken breast with a slab of asiago cheese (melted and oh-so-gooey delicious), hatch chiles, black beans.  She was quite happy with this one.  \n\nWe also ordered a side of the garlic \"chips\" which are pretty much oven baked french fries - just like an order of fish and chips.  \n\nWe ended on the Chocolate bread and butter pudding served with creme anglaise and vanilla ice cream.  So decadent and quite tasty.  Perfect ending.\n\nI can't wait to go back and try new varieties of the pasty.  The options seemed limitless.  Not to mention go back and drink all their beers and partake of the $3 car bombs.  \n\nService was good, although the pasties take a few minutes to cook.  So don't expect it to be \"fast food.\"  Good food takes a bit of time to cook properly!

I had read great reviews, so was happy to finally visit for myself.\n\nThe food was great- worth a four or even a five star review. There were a few things that really hurt the quality of the experience for me.\n\nThe seating at CPC is four sets of church pew seats around tables fashioned from large doors. What was frustrating is that each set of seats were occupied with really small groups of 2-4 people. The waitstaff could have easily asked people to move to one end of the pews or the other, and the length could easily hold two separate sets of diners without encroaching on either party's personal space. Instead, we stood and waited for 15 minutes.\n\nSecond, the temperature of the place was hot and muggy. Running some fans or turning up the AC a teeny bit would have made things more comfortable.\n\nThe music was really loud, and we had to shout over it to talk across the table. It seemed a little like they were trying to be more of a bar/hipster hangout than a restaurant. \n\nThe service left a bit to be desired, but I don't fault our sweet waitress. She was nice and as attentive as she could be, but admitted she was frazzled as there were only two on shift for the entire restaurant. Since I've only been once I don't know if that's the norm, but I hope not.\n\nOne important note- if you are a picky eater, take a look at their menu online and call ahead a few hours early for special orders. You can't make any substitutions as everything is made in advance and half-cooked, then finished cooking when ordered. A bit of a bummer though, because you have to order 2 for special orders.\n\nSomething that stood out in a great way was their entire page of vegetarian pasty selections. So awesome! I hadn't had a good shepherd's pie since ditching meat many years ago, so it was great to have a well made veggie version. If and when I return, I'll definitely try some of the other meatless pockets of deliciousness.\n\nAlso, the mushy peas were out of this world.

Oh no, no, no, this is much more and infinetly better than an item you find in the frozen food section of your local grocer.  A pasty is fresh, not frozen, and the filling choices are infinetly better than the stardard ham and cheese or pepperoni pizza hot pocket.  \n\nThis location is bigger than the Tempe location.

I was hoping for the best to drive that far and take a longer lunch.\n\nThe menu was very diverse and suited many types of cravings.  They had everything in the pasty from chicken pot pie to chicken tikka massala.  I would like to try one of those one day, but I opted for the portobello vinagrette.  It came with a piping hot side of marinara sauce that had some fresh garlic cut into the sauce.  When I took that first bite, I felt like I was in heaven.

The location in Mesa is definitely bigger with more tables available, but we go to the one in Tempe too because it's closer to work.

Everything was extremely tasty. We took a trip to the UK last year and that was the first time I had encountered pasties which were viewed there more as street food to eat on the run, like hot dogs are in NY. But I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the menu here since there are so many options! They have every kind of pasty you could want, even tex-mex and Italian style options. I went for the traditional British shepherd's pie and it was amazingly good. My husband got the rosemary steak which I had a bite of and I thought it was also very good, although neither of us liked the sauce it came with. Since it was a chilly night, we started with the soup; he had the potato-leek and I had the mushroom. Both were very good although I could feel my arteries clogging up as I drank mine (think major butter/cream). We also ordered garlic chips (wedge fries with chopped roasted garlic on top) and they were d-lish! As it turned out the pasties were so large we really should not have ordered sides but I forced myself to box up half of mine so that I could save room for desert. I had the Shirley Temple pudding which was this amazing British-style pudding with caramel sauce that made the top and edges a little crispy. It came with the sweet cream to drizzle on top. It was like bread candy. I know that sounds weird but it was seriously good. \n\nI agree with the other reviewers that the service is extremely slow. We were there for over 2 1/2 hours! But I got the impression it was due to them being short-staffed and the fact that the nature of the food means it takes a while to cook... rather than the servers being rude or snobby. The excellent variety of beers on tap (including Strongbow cider, yay!) means that you can keep yourself entertained in the interim and the food is definitely worth the wait.

I remember being a busboy at a family owned restaurant in Mesa and the staff would always have bathroom duties every hour or so, checking on the bathroom and do general whip-downs and toilet cleaning. It's really a managerial duty to assign tasks like these to the staff.\n\nMoving on to the pasty... well, it was pretty darn good! My friend had the Oogie and I ordered the Greek Chicken. I like the Oogie more... the sauce that accompanied it was delicious, it seemed like it was roux-based; but the second time we went there they gave us a totally different sauce with our Oogie. They had some other sauce with it that tasted like berries. We asked out server if they had another sauce similar to our first visit. We tried explaining what the sauce was like, in terms or color, texture, and goodness, but she came out with a comparable - H.D. (?) sauce. It was ok - not the same though.

Everything was perfect.  I love the outdoor seating, I love the indoor seating, I love the decor and the food doesn't fuck around.  The taste doesn't tip-toe and pussyfoot around while you chew on it, it loads the flavor into a shotgun shells and fires it into you mouth and laughs at you when you're taken back by how delicious everything is.\n\nI love taking friends to places like this because you get to see their over-the-top reaction to it as well.  It's like when you watch one of your favorite movies with a friend who's never seen it and you get to keep saying, \"Oh, this is the best part.\"  With the Cornish Pasty, it's the same thing, so many elements are the best part.\n\nI want to be baked into a pasty and I want to eat my way out of one, but I don't want to drown in gravy or something.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Abridged:\nMeat.

The decor also has a nice relaxing but slightly sophisticated feel. And there aren't a million ASU students prancing about and hardly ever a wait in line when we head there for lunch. \n\nVegetarian or not, there's always a pasty for everyone. Every time I've gone to either location, I've never gotten the same one twice, and I still have over 3/4 of the menu to clear off my list with most of them being ones I would love to enjoy. They're big enough that half the time I end up taking half home with me... though that's probably because I after trying the Banoffee Pie, I haven't been able to not order it since. So usually it's take half my pasty home and split Banoffee, which is the most heavenly dessert on the planet. \n\nAll the items are made there, and if you sit at the bar/kitchen area you can watch them making them right there in the restaurant. It's kinda fun really. Sometimes I watch a little too closely if I know they're making a favorite, trying to figure out how I can mimic this masterpiece at home. Alas, I've always ended up failing. \n\nOne thing to note is that while they make them there, they prep them in advance so you cannot substitute. However, I've been toying with the idea of calling a week in advance to have a special one made and paying up front so I can enjoy it a few days later.\n\nSo, back to this Banoffee Pie deal... I think I need to inform you in advance to save you from desperately trying to resist its allure when you visit due to this amazingly good review. So, it's a pretty awesome dessert. First, you start with a thick graham cracker crust. I am personally not a huge fan of graham cracker, but this isn't your typical crust like on a pie or a lemon bar. This looks like texas toast. For serious. Then add some homemade caramel, homemade whipped cream and bananas.

I usually go to the one in Tempe (where I've never had as many issues) but chose this one because it's a larger building and closer to dad's place. \nAs soon as I walked in, there was a weird smell. It wasn't a food smell but a people smell (an intimate people smell.... ugh). I assume that was because of the cooling issue, which I'll talk about further on...\n\nI opted for sitting at the bar because it was pretty full and a little too warm to sit outside (though there were plenty of people far braver than I). Also, when I've sat at the bar in the Tempe location, the employees have always been jovial and friendly and up for a good chat. I wasn't so lucky this time.\n\nFor starters, we got the creamy tomato soup. It came with croutons and a few slices of home-made soda bread and butter. I've never ordered their soups before and it was awesome! I'll definitely get this next time I eat at the Tempe one. \nMain course: dad got the Philly cheese steak pasty (he's not one for tradition, I guess) and I went for my favourite - meat (2 types of pork sausage) and cheese. I also got a side of the home-made baked beans. The pasty, as usual, was really good but the baked beans were gross - dry and just all the wrong flavours. I much prefer canned, I guess. They were either in the oven too long or had been sitting out... just not fresh.\nWhile the food (minus the beans) was good, the building was super hot. It was pretty crowded and we were sitting by the bar where all the ovens and things are, but they need to definitely invest in a better cooling system with more vents or something because it was almost unbearable - and it wasn't even in the triple digits outside yet. I can't imagine eating there in the middle of the summer! \nAlso, service was really spotty. What I presume was the owner (or at least a manager) came by a few times and we had our plates cleared but we were sitting on the end of the bar right in front of a girl making fillings and she didn't say a single word to us the whole time. I wanted some HP sauce and I couldn't get her attention since she didn't bother to look up once. I get that you're busy but you're still an employee and it's still part of your job to handle some customer service. Even a smile would have been nice, but was perhaps too much to expect from a restaurant that hires only 20-something hipsters and hippies (and I don't mean that insultingly, it's just facts). Perhaps I'm getting old in my young age.\nAlso, that HP sauce I wanted? They were out of because of \"supplier problems\". You know they sell it at every Fresh & Easy, Trader Joe's, and World Market, right? You don't need to import it yourself and if you're out of an English staple in an English restaurant, at least go out and buy a few bottles till your \"supplier problems\" are handled.

Wonderful companion to the chicken and provided a \"cool\" contrast to the spiciness of the Tikka.  Kept in theme with the Indian spices with a modern salad dressing twist.  Excellent.  I'd love the have this salad often!  I was rather disappointed in the pasty.  The chicken was rather dry and I found it heavy on the thyme.  Veggies in it were tender and well cooked.  The crust was lovely:   light, flaky and flavorful.  I'd give this pasty a 3.  \n\nService was good (a bit slow bringing the check at the end), ambiance had a British Isles pub feel.  Good experience over all and I'll be back for the Chicken Tikka Salad and to give a different pasty a try.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "How have I not reviewed this place yet?!  \n\nThe Cornish Pasty Co. is incredible.  \n\nI am from So Cal and it has become my tradition that I visit it twice every time I am in Phoenix - when I first arrive and then again when I am on my way to the airport.\n\nThe pastys are so good the boyfriend and I have devised a way for me to transport the partially cooked pasties by plane to Southern California so I will have extra stock when I get home :-)\n\nThe is hands down my favorite place I have ever eaten at.

In Mesa? Doing successfully in one of the most cursed plaza's in Mesa history? Yes, yes and yes, apparently...\n\nI've always wanted to try a pasty...glad I was finally able to. On walking in, you realize the place is so British, that there's actually a bit of culture shock. The big long tables and benches may have you questioning whether or not you should sit down at one of these tables with an already seated party, and the answer is YES, you should! Thats how its done on the other side of the pond, and thats how its done at the Cornish Pasty Co.\n\nThey have a pretty good beer selection. My party of 3 split a large greek salad, and we could have used another one or two mouths to help us out. The dressing it comes with is a lemon pesto salad dressing, which was delicious. A word of caution, however: A little goes a long way. Its pretty thick, potent stuff. But it really does go well with the red onion, olives and feta in the salad.\n\nI ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala pasty, and later I was also able to try the Chicken Pesto pasty. Both were very very good, but I liked the Tikka Masala a little better. It seemed like it was a very popular choice there as well. I would say on both pasties, the side dressings left a little to be desired. The tikka masala comes with their version of raita, a traditional indian yogurt dressing, but their flavor (while not tasting bad) did seem kinda off for some reason. The pesto chicken came with marinara, and again it seemed a little off.\n\nThe clientele here is a pretty mixed bag. The servers are the tatt'd up, facial piercings type, which Im not sure exactly why that is, but I dont mind it. Im not judging anyone, but there seemed to be a lot of lesbians in the place too. I have not a clue why either would be the case, but It didnt bother me--just struck me as odd. The place at 5:30 was PACKED. You come any later and you WILL NOT get a seat.\n\nOne last thing that I would like to mention is that for the vegetarians out there, this place is extremely veg-friendly. Practically an entire page of their menu is dedicated to pasties with quorn fake meat products, which although I didnt try, Im sure would be fantastic.\n\nI will definitely be back soon, though maybe next time Ill try lunch and see if its maybe a little less crowded.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 2, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "Think Hot pockets on steroids*.

While they take no reservations, they treated us courteously, and seated us after a short wait.\n\nThis is not the quietest place to eat at, as a lot of it has to do with the bar, which is very conducive to friendly chit chat, but overlooking that, it's quite a charming place. There is seating outside, as well as in church pews inside, which makes for a cozy atmosphere as well as the possibility of having new conversations with people you have never met - something that Americans are not used to, but is very common in the rest of the world.\n\nEveryone ordered soft drinks except for myself. I ordered a Strongbow to see if it was what I remembered from the U.K., and it was no different at all. A true hard cider with good flavor of apples.\n\nFor my main course, I ordered the Oggie, a mixture of steak, potato, onion and rutabaga, served in a pastry crust with a small cruet of red wine gravy. ($8.00) . I was instantly transported back to the U.K. with my first bite. It had great depth of flavor, and the red wine sauce was absolute dynamite. An excellent dish! I also ordered a side of Mushy Peas ($2.75) and a side of Baked Beans ($2.50). The peas had nice flavor and were exactly as served in England, but I didn't care for the Baked Beans. There seemed to be an odd flavor associated with them that was off putting and which everyone agreed was not very tasty. \n\nOther members of our party ordered the Italian, the Porky (pronounced as orgasmic), the Shepherds Pie, the Reuben (good corned beef), the Chicken Greek (said to be very tasty), and the Lamb Vindaloo (usually very spicy, but apparently toned down here for American palates). Two of our party ordered the Pilgrim, which is roasted turkey, sweet potatoes, grilled onions, stuffing and red wine gravy. One pronounced it terrific, while the other didn't care for it.\n\nThe menu also includes a nice assortment of vegetarian dishes as well.\n\nMost people didn't have room for dessert, but a few did, with almost everyone sharing. One of the desserts was Banoffee Pie - a graham cracker crust, homemade caramel, whipped cream and fresh bananas. It was interesting to note that the whipped cream was unsweetened. When mixed with the other ingredients, it picked up it's sweetness from them and tended to tone down the overall sweetness of the dish - a wonderful idea of what would otherwise have been an overly sweet dessert.\n\n\nThe other dessert that was ordered was the Apple Caramel Pasty - a kind of apple turnover pie crammed full of apples and cinnamon and covered with a homemade caramel sauce and served with a large scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream. Nothing could have been better, especially since the caramel wasn't too sweet.\n\nConsidering how crowded the place was, service was not too bad, and certainly could have been a lot worse.\n\nPerhaps the only fault I could find was with the ladies room. The paper bin was full to the top, and the rolls of paper were scattered around instead of being in holders.

The food has always been delicious, so I was thrilled when they opened a location closer to home.  The food is still good, but there are two issues with this location that really need to be addressed.  First, as other reviewers have noted, there is a really bad odor inside the restaurant.  It almost smells like bad feet.  I don't know if its a particular food that is making that bad smell or what, but because of it, we always opt to eat outside.  When you enter a restaurant you should be greeted with a cornucopia of deliciousness -not a weird stench that makes you want to run.\n\nSecondly, the customer service.  This is consistently - inconsistent.  Sometimes its ok, and then other times its just plain terrible.  The other night we had to wait 1 1/2 hours for our food and we didn't see our waitress for over an hour--that's right-AN HOUR--no drink refills, nada.  In fact we almost just left.  I don't care how busy you are, that is unacceptable.  If the customer service was excellent, I could overlook the 5 earrings in the nose-20 tats-freak show waiters they have serving the customers. (ok, so they ARE friendly for the most part)  But bad service, coupled with hippie freaky waiters is starting to wear thin.  I really want to give this place 5 stars because their food is wonderful, but until they get their customer service up to par and get rid of that smell. this place is never going to be in my top 5.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "If you are reading these reviews and have never indulged in the tasty delights served by Cornish Pasty Company, you must get your ass over there as soon as possible!\n\nThe variety of options is astounding for a place with a menu largely dominated by a single item: the humble pasty.  Nearly every major cuisine is represented, and for the vegetarians, this place is mecca, because there are just as many options on that side of the menu as the omnivorous one.  They also have a few sides (Cauliflower and Broccoli Cheese Bake is f*cking INCREDIBLE), salads, soups, and desserts.  Strangely enough, I've never tried any of the desserts, but they all look amazing.\n\nMe and the boyfriend's favorite flavors include Rosemary Steak, Lovely Bit of Salmon, Bangers and Mash, Peppered Steak, and The Royale with Cheese (yes, they have a cheeseburger option, perfect for a picky kid, just don't let them eat the whole thing!)  And speaking of portion size, don't think when you first behold your precious pasty that it is nothing to write home about in terms of size.  That little football will fill you to the brim, (this is probably the reason I've never had their desserts!)  They are great to split with a friend along with a salad or other side, if you are looking to lighten it up a bit.\n\nI can't really comment on the service.  Since the Mesa location is a quarter mile from our house, we always order out.  From what I can tell, they are packed every night.

Food took a bit long but we also were expecting 'custom-baked' pasty.  Plus our server was quick enough to bring us drinks and my soup order, etc to hold us over;  Our server guy was outstanding - friendly in a genuine way, prompt, kept checking on us, and had very good customer service skills (I'll get to that later).\n-dirty place: Yes, as I mentioned, it needs a good cleaning (those pew cushions were nasty and the wax should be scraped off and menus cleaned up)\n-smells: Yes, but we deduced it was the cabbage.\n-dingy servers/food preppers: It's an 'alternative' type of staff.. I myself am not that alternative, but I have no issues if my servers look like Cheba Hut or Pita Jungle employees :) As long as they are clean with handling my food (at least, that I notice).  I did note, however one of the food preppers talking on his cell phone while he was handling food.. I thought that was gross (god knows where cell phones hang out and all the dingy dialing we do).\n\nOK, so now to the food:\nI had the Chicken Tikka Masala and my friend had the Chicken Pot Pie - both were delicious!  I was super impressed with the breadth of the pasty 'stuffings' and got very excited to see they had over 40 options!  I want to go back and try them all.  The yogurt served with my tikka was perfect.. the chicken was plentiful and well seasoned.  Essentially, their fillings are both inventive, somewhat unique and really entice me to come back.  Plus, I appreciated that their pastys are a good size and that it is not a dough-overwhelmed dish (meaning the crust is perfectly thinly sized and not like a calzone).\n\nBottome line:\nYes, there is a distinctly strong smell when you walk in ...yes, the pews had dirty cushions on them.. the candle wax was all over the table/menus, the menus had other grime on there.. honestly this place REALLY needs to quit the slacking and clean this place up... BUT, their pastys were yummy and their service was excellent - 2 major players in making me want to come back.\n\nOkay, so now to the note about customer service:\nI found a piece of red thick rubber-band (~1\" long) in my soup .. we could only assume, due to it's color and size, it was the ones used to bunch up produce (It was a leek-potato, stilton soup).  Yeah, not excited about that find, but I did appreciate that when I mentioned it to our server, he swiftly took it away (offered me a new one) and immediately apologized and said it was 'on the house'.  THAT is fixing a problem immediately and correctly - kudos for him for a great response and showing good customer service.

So I was excited to try this place out.  Right off the bat though, I love that they have so many vegetarian and vegan options.  That's really nice.\n\nI tried the balsamic portobello mushroom pasty, the chips, and the chocolate bread and butter pudding.  Overall, it was good.  I would say that, aside from the chips, it's not as authentic as I would have hoped for.  The pasty itself was a bit more \"posh\" than what you'd normally find.  To be fair, I didn't do a direct comparison.  In Cornwall, I had previously eaten the more traditional pasties like cheese and onion, pork and apple, etc.  But I'm not looking a gift horse in the mouth, as I said, I was very happy to have so many veggie options.  But the pasty did seem more posh in term of the pastry being more refined than what you'd normally see.  I mean, basically, the pasties they serve are actually probably better made and prepared than real pasties... the pastry is crisper but also a little tougher.  Overall, I like my pasty though.\n\nThe chocolate bread and butter pudding though, I'm afraid, was really not what I was expecting.  Real bread and butter pudding is made with chunks of bread and, you guessed it, soaked in butter (among other things).  What I was served was something more like a sponge cake soaked with brandy and comes with a little pot of creme anglaise (which I don't think I was ever served at any time in the UK, but hey ho!).  The sponge cake has more of a consistency of treacle tart/pudding.  Minus the treacle, of course.  And again, it tasted really nice and was a lovely dessert in it's own right, it was just not bread and butter pudding.  It looked like a striped cube, by the way.\n\nSo I guess for the food that's my review, that the food was very good in it's own right, and possibly is a posh version of those foods, but I didn't get that authentic homey feel from it like I hoped because it wasn't the real thing.\n\nI would definitely go there again though.

It was about 100 that day, and we were sitting outside. \n-The server said they don't split checks. Weird. They've done it other times I've been there. Plus, we were perfectly split into our groups, so why is this difficult? \n-The general attitude of our server was very poor, like we were a bad interruption in his day.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I've had this twice - once my friend, the penguin, brought some over - and then Saturday night we actually dined there.

The pub atmosphere is great with a lot of bar and counter seating and church pew type benches for seating, but made comfortable with cushions.\n\nI had the Oggie and really enjoyed the tender, flavorful steak and potatoes.  The crust for the pasties was nice too.  Very flaky and buttery.  My husband had the Meat & Cheese and we both liked the spice blend in that one.

Crisp on the outside, but like floaty mashed potatoes on the inside.  3/3.  \n\nI was impressed with the beer selection.  They have everything from local brews to Oregon and CA brews to Chimay and a couple of other European ones.  I started with the Hoegaarden white, which I had never had and enjoyed immensely.  My husband ordered the Rogue Hazelnut Brown and that's not what he got.  It was a very good IPA, I suspect it was the Four Peaks IPA that was on the menu, but it definitely wasn't the Rogue which we have had many times.  He mentioned it to our server (who was great by the way, even though it was fairly busy in there), and she said he wasn't the only one to say that, but that's the beer that came out of the Rogue tap.  I think they got their kegs crossed or something.  She offered to get him something else and I forget what he ordered but it was the correct beer that time.  She didn't charge us for the first beer, which was a nice surprise when we got the check, even though we drank every last drop of it.  We didn't know what it was, but it was not going to go to waste.  \n\nI ended with the Firestone Walker Double DBA.  I think.  By that time all the blood was in my very happy belly.

Whenever I've had a long, crappy day (or week, or month, or...), I usually find myself craving my go-to comfort food. This, my friends, is Cornish Pasty.\n\nI wasn't always a believer. When I first heard about CP last year, I thought it sounded kinda weird. \"I don't think I'll like it,\" I told my Cult of Pasty friends. You can't accurately describe the glory that is a pasty to someone who has never experienced it. (As another reviewer noted, \"glorified hot pocket\" doesn't sound too appealing.) But if you haven't tried it yet, at least do it once, just so you don't have to wonder anymore. Seriously, just go.\n\nI have never tried a pasty I didn't like. Ever. Thing is, I'm an extremely picky eater, and I dislike a lot of veggies (taste, texture, whatever, they weird me out). Yet this place can make me eat spinach, artichokes, tomatoes, onions, and potatoes like they're my favorite foods. Somehow, they magically combine a bunch of ingredients that sound like they may or may not go well together into one amazingly delicious, harmonious pocket of baked goodness. It's always perfect. I was especially hesitant to try the salmon pasty, but you know what? It's one of my favorites. Magic, I tell you.\n\nBut great food comes with a price. There's a good chance there will be a little wait here. There's also a good chance the service will be spotty, which is why I knocked off one star. On several occasions, our server has been extremely scarce, or food has come out at different times (as in, one pasty comes out and 15 minutes later, the other is out... doesn't make for a great dining experience with your partner). Mostly, we just have to wait to get anything we ask for, so bring your patience with you just in case.\n\nMy least favorite thing, though, is the door leading to the patio. That freaking door! On my last visit, it drove me CRAZY because every 15 seconds, someone would come in or out, and it would SLAM so audibly that I couldn't ignore it. I think it's just the door itself, but couldn't they like... make an effort to close it quietly, if they can't get it fixed? It was so distracting that I was having a hard time hearing conversations or enjoying my meal. There's no way I'm the only one bothered by this. Management, please fix ASAP.\n\nBut here's a great thing: when you're not in the mood to deal with being squished into a little bench with some strangers or searching for your waiter to get the water refill you needed 10 minutes ago, you can always call in your order, pick it up, and bake it at home - then sit down with your favorite beer or wine and enjoy your meal in privacy.

Frankly, I expected it to be \"good, but not my style,\" as I prefer lighter, healthier food for the most part, NOT a \"meat & potatoes person.\"\n\nWent there alone since my family wasn't with me. I was a very \"un-hipster\" 40-ish yr old female alone. As I walked up I noted the loud patio, people having fun/drinking, hmm. Inside: dark but not in a seedy way, real wax dripped down the wine bottles holding the candles. Church pew seating as mentioned. Pretty cool, but the tables looked huge & daunting for this SWF diner. The outside looked too \"party\". \n\nNo one really approached me right away, a few people said hi, but they all looked so casual sans uniform, I couldn't quite tell if they worked there or just walking by?  Didn't know if I should wait to be seated, but there was really no obvious place to wait for such guidance, as the front door leads right into the dining room. After a few awkward seconds I identified that guy as definitely an employee & threw myself at his mercy, \"Hi. I'm new. How does this work?\"  He was great, sit anywhere. Grabbed a seat at the end of the raised bar. As someone else said, a good place to bolt from if things didn't go well. Also had a good view of the dining room, the kitchen prep area & the servers work area. \n\nFriendly Serena stopped by, I warned her too that I was new. She was great! Since they clearly have a great, well-chosen list of ales & beers & that seems an obvious British accompaniment to pastys, I told her some of the beers I normally liked, such as IPAs, Kiltlifter, Dogfish Head 60 & 90. She lit up & said she's bring a sample of one she thinks I'd like. Love the service already!! I love love love when they bring samples of something so you can truly decide before committing. She NAILED IT - On-tap Green Flash Hop Head Red. Never heard of it, LOVE IT.\n\nOrdered the Chicken Tika Masala pasty since I was in the international mood & Yelpers said it was good. Waited the 15 mins or so. Noticed that the servers have fun, the kitchen is friendly like everyone says, the crowd is diverse.  The music is great, stuff I like, upbeat, some good swing-dancing music, Stray Cats, etc. Only thru Yelp reviews did I learn it's now \"hipster\" music, ha ha. Then arrived the pasty...\n\nSOOOO much better than a typical calzone crust! I love how thin but sort of crisp the crust is! Nothing even close to doughy, it's lightly holding the divine insides. The Chicken was moist and chunky, the tikka masala sauce was spiced but not \"hot,\" really savory flavor.  The side sauce was perfect with it, nice touch that they all have various perfect accompaniment sauces! I asked Serena for a box right away to take the other half home to family. Good thing I did, or I would have stuffed myself with it because it was sooo tasty & been in pain later.\n\nI'm also not really much of a dinner-out dessert person, as they are usually too over the top gooey sweet for me. But the Banoffee Pie with bananas caught my eye. Home-made caramel? In home-made graham crust? What??  Argh, okay....  I can have a few bites & take the rest home.\n\nSerena was again brilliant, telling the kitchen to \"build it\" in the to-go container. Once it arrived, I could see why, truly awesome suggestion, as moving it would have messed it all up. The guy behind the counter asked,  \"Just bananas or also strawberries?\" I deferred to Serena the Expert... \"Plus strawberries.\"   He told me when busy, he doesn't have time to create this masterful work of art that he made, but tonight he was able to do so. It was beautiful, and tasted 10 times better. I couldn't stop. I didn't know why. Finally, another server stopped by and we chatted about it. The secret is: the caramel is sweet, the graham crust is both sweet & salty, & the whipped cream isn't sweetened at all. The balance is WONDERFUL!

But then I thought of all of the amazing reviews about this place on Yelp, and how we thought it might become a regular haunt for us.\n\nSo we hopped in the car with our two kids and headed out.\n\nAfter parking, we walked up to the restaurant, where 3 people were sitting below the entry door and patio.  We went up to the door and looked around, not quite sure where to go.  There was no staff, and no obvious stand with a hostess, but I saw two empty big booths outside on the patio.  So I left my husband and two kids standing around by the door outside while I went inside.  I was greeted by the side of a bar.  Still no staff or obvious hostessing area.  I walked across the restaurant and saw a couple of empty tables, another empty table outside, and a lot of space up at the bar.  The only staff were standing at the kitchen bar area, and one girl was loading up with plates.  Still no obvious hostess.  I told the girl that we were new and had never been there before, and asked if we just seat ourselves.  She said \"Yeah\".  I said \"Great, we'll sit outside then.

I thought God was playing a sick trick on me. I shuffled through radio stations faster than old people shuffle board. But it was true. Thee \"Coyote\" sold out.\n\nAll hope had been lost. My spirit was shattered, and the little moisture I had left was now a soggy puddle in the passenger's seat. I was in a dire situation. In desperation, I checked between the seat cushions hoping to find some crumbs to eat but instead found a few petrified McDonald french fries. I looked at them and thought to myself: \"I'd rather eat pigeon crap.\" I flicked the measly fries out of my Pinto then used my finger to write a goodbye message on the dirty windshield and began my trek amid the arid desert. \n\nAs far as I could see, nothing but cacti and cheap Mexican food restaurants. The little vegetation was riddled with thorns and bore no fruit. The thought of a carne asada burrito tempted me like a mirage, but I knew the explosive diarrhea I'd get would dry me out quicker than a sponge in the sun. I had to stay strong and keep going. \n\nAfter four long minutes of walking, I gave up. The sun leached my energy and exhausted all remaining calories. The horizon held no signs of hope. Just signs for Filiberto's, Amado's, Los Favorito's, Armando's, Pedrito's, and Taco Bell. My pasty skin was turning pink and my balls looked like raisins, so I sat in the shade of a palo verde tree and prayed. I begged God not to let me die. I repented my sins. I promised that if he let me live I'd never do anything bad ever again. \n\nThen, out of the blue, I felt drops of wetness on my bald scalp. I turned my head up to the sky and saw that a pigeon was dropping deuces from the branch above. I knew Jesus turned water into wine, but I had no idea He could read minds. (I guess He wasn't too fond of me flicking french fries onto the desert ground.) God trickled the sign I was begging for right on my forehead, and now He was now putting me to the test. If I wanted to be saved, I'd have to eat this pigeon poo. So, I bowed my head, placed my palms together, and said grace. \n\nThere was a trembling rumble that echoed across the desert and it wasn't the sound of me regurgitating. As I stood up from the gravel to peer into abyss of newly formed clouds, a surge of water swept my legs out from under me. Before I knew it, I was being carried away in a flash flood. \n\nMy next memory was waking to the sound of chirping birds. I flinched and covered my face fearing that I may be lying under another pigeon-riddled palo verde. I opened my eyes and was blinded by colors. I didn't know what was going on. Vibrant reds, blues, yellows, and greens! I had no idea where I was. I suddenly got scared and pooped a Skittle. Then it hit me. You know when people say that it's impossible to reach the end of the rainbow? It's a lie. I was there. It's at the entrance of a mystical place called Cornish Pasty. \n\nI entered the land of the Cornish and it was like no place I'd ever been. I anticipated for there to be leprechauns. I encountered a species far more enchanting, with skins of the finest tapestries and earlobes so large and peculiar that they could double as tire swings. Apparently, I wasn't the first person to reach the End of the Rainbow, because this Cornish Pasty place was rather busy. I tracked down one of these Cornish creatures and told her my story, explaining how famished I was. She was unusually polite and let me sit in her earlobe until a seat opened up at a table. I swung around the restaurant as she went from table to table, filling mugs up with magically frothy beer. Then, I whispered in her ear: \"Are there pots of gold here?\" A spot at a table had opened up and she sat me down. She told me that she'd be right back. \n\nI sketched pictures of these Cornish creatures as I waited. The girl returned and placed a dish in front of me. She gave me a wink, then walked away. I grabbed the warm pocket of food that rested on the metal plate before me, stuffed it in my mouth, and died.\n\nIt was gold, my friends.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "This place is AMAZING!

Until eating here I had never actually tried \"authentic\" British food, but I'm sure glad I did!  Both the atmosphere and the taste made eating here amazing. \n\nPerhaps it's because I am a part of the younger generation, but I am frequently drawn to restaurants that have a simple, modern aesthetic. The softly lit and rustic feel of Cornish Pasty co. fulfilled this desire to the brim. Not only did the atmosphere make it enjoyable (a wonderfully mellow alternative rock playlist wavered overhead), but the kindness and charisma of the servers helped as well. They weren't afraid to chat you up as you ordered, but knew to not overstep their boundaries. \n\nFinally, there is the food (mmmm yes. The FOOD.) As I mentioned, I had not indulged in what might be called culturally British food before. Because of this I played it safe and ordered the chipotle chicken pasty, whose name rang familiar with my southern grown tastebuds. What followed was a tasty adventure. The portions are well suited for the type of food, and I finished just as I started feeling full. The pasty itself was delicious, a great combination of meat that reminded me of the lovechild of a calzone and a spanakopita. But what sealed the deal was the sauce. Each pasty comes with a flavor specific sauce to accompany it and it was not something I felt I could do without. \n\nSo here's a recap: Tasty, good atmosphere, friendly servers, delicious sauce. 5 Stars.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Love love love!\n\nHaven't had a pasty I didn't like from this place!\n\nPros:\n-Great/friendly staff\n-Lots of good options to explore on the menu (including vegetarian options)\n-Nice variety of beers and decent  happy hour specials\n-Fun/down-to-earth feel\n\nCons:\n-You essentially seat yourself, which can get tricky if you're going with a large group.

The ambiance is quite different and has a dark mysterious factor that I really enjoy.  There aren't really any lights other than the kitchen.

I always bring friends and family visiting here to try the unique cuisine. I like to explain it as 'gourmet hot pockets'. I haven't ordered a thing I didn't like. I know it can be hard for picky eaters since there are no substitutions but thankfully I don't have that problem. Their soups are amazing, all made in house. The peppered steak and chicken and rice soup are my two favorite dishes. The Mesa location recently added some new appetizers and I can't wait to try them all.

Last time I ate at the mesa location the service had improved a lot, unfortunately I went to Tempe a week later and had awful service. I could go into detail about the awful service, forgetting ordered items, being ignored and the general distasteful appearance of the staff. I don't mind tattoos and piercings, I have some! I was even a waitress for 7 years, but you should really brush your hair, shower, or wear socks to work.\n\nIf you like great food, drinks and atmosphere and can stand the idiots they hire to serve you. Then definitely eat here. I will continue to be a regular, I just wish their management would shape up those servers. I would recommend the Mesa location over the Tempe one.

Although I will say the jalapenos didn't quite make sense. I like jalapenos don't get me wrong but they were just chopped up on top. When you picked up a fry they fell off. If you managed to get a few to stick they would come off when you dipped it in the sauce. You can bypass the sauce and just eat one but they didn't really add anything.

They have an Italian one, cheesesteak one, Greek one, a few Mexican flavored ones and so on and so on. You name it it was in a pasty. I finally decided on the spicy chicken asagio one with some advice from my girlfriend who has been here before. Sure it takes awhile for the food to come out but they are making it when you order it. By the time you sip on your drinks and munch on those fantastic chips your food comes out so it works out. So good. Flavor was perfect. Everything all crammed in there but all working together.

Their pasty menu is really extensive!! We were having a hard time trying to make a selection from among the wide range of premium & signature pasties. We finally decided to settle on the Lamb Vindaloo Pasty(for the Indian flavour) and the Chicken Pot Pie Pasty. \n\nFor appetizers, we had the tandoori chicken wings - these were super oily, so much so that the waitress even gave us extra napkins to wipe off the excess oil.. eww! But I would give this appetizer a slight plus point for the spicy masalas coating the wings, that made it tasty. I just wish they had done a better job of marinating the chicken wings in the proper fashion before cooking them the right way(which's baking & grilling them and not deep frying!!)\n\nThe accompanying yoghurt mint sauce was what really caught our attention more than the chicken wings itself. Its super duper delicious!! The waitress who served us was very helpful in explaining the different sauces served here and she even brought us different samplers to try out during the main course.\n\nThe lamb vindaloo pasty was awesome, true to it's taste. If you are a lamb fan, you should definitely give this pasty a try. The chicken pot pie pasty was passable with a mixed blend of potatoes, vegetables and chopped chicken. It went well with the yoghurt-mint sauce and the tahini sauce.\n\nFinally, it was desert time and once again we were at a loss to pick one among the various tempting choices on the list. The waitress once again poured in with her help, describing the best and the okayish desserts. If you are a toffee fan, the Sticky Toffee Pudding is the most delicious on the list.  They had also run out of the Chocolate bread & butter pudding that day since everyone seemed to be ordering it. \n\nWe finally decided to give the Banoffie Pie a try. Beware!, the dessert is too much for just two people. We were full by the time we finished off half of the pie. The pie's crust was difficult to break and had a hidden layer of caramel cream within, which complimented well with the whipped cream. Aah, the whipped cream.. is well, not the lighter version, but a heavy thick cream that tastes almost like homemade butter. You can only have so much of that heavy cream. I wouldn't have it again.\n\nI would give this place 4 stars for the food, 3.5 stars for the service. 3 stars for the ambience(they had good candle lighting all over, but if you prefer someplace quiet, then you should skip this place).", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Tried this place for the 1st time my brother and best friend have been ranting about!\nAll in all the atmosphere was soothing low lighting, hip music, and good beers!

Tonight my sister and I had another great meal here. The service was only so so but the pasties are so good that I will give them a pass on service at least for now. We were originally seated in an area of the patio outside which we were told by the hostess, used to be a smoking area but they had recently turned it into a non smoking area. We really wanted to sit outside on this beautiful evening so we put up with the lingering smoky aroma and ash trays that were sitting on the table next to us. After we had ordered drinks, the table behind us proceeded to light up a cig. We were not to fond of this since we were told by the hostess that this was now a non smoking area. We decided to move tables since we observed that another nearby table, outside of the \"smoking\" area. We did inform our waitress of the move before we officially made it. I know that this is not necessarily the best thing to do in a restaurant setting because of the set up of waiter/ess per table or area but since we were mislead into believing that we were seated in a non smoking area, we felt it necessary to move.\n\nAnyhow, our waitress did not seem to fond of the fact that we had moved and she rudely made the comment to us that and I quote \"THAT IS THE SMOKING AREA\" well I am sorry miss lady! We were told it was non smoking!! I would rather not be around cigarette smoke during my delicious pasty meal. I ended up ordering some Cornish coleslaw to start which was fantastic. It does have a fair amount of raw red onions in it, so be aware if you are ordering it on a date or a lunch break. It is more of savory coleslaw rather than sweet with hints of horseradish. I ordered the bangers and mash pasty. It was absolutely delicious! They do make their own sage sausage in house and it is oh so good! Mashed potatoes and sausage with a sage sausage gravy, YUM!! My sister had the chicken pot pie pasty and was equally impressed.\n\nOverall the food is delicious.

Strolling up the Royal Mile, my attention was caught by some attractive looking flats down Fishmarket Close. I ventured down the way for a closer look and that's when I spotted it in all it's blink-and-you'll-miss-it, Secret Arcade-esque glory.\n\nSituated at the bottom of said flats, and halfway between the Royal Mile and the Cowgate, Michael Neave Kitchen and Whisky Bar looks to be one of those best kept secrets of Edinburgh. Hadn't heard so much as a mutter about this place, and not even on Yelp yet only strengthened the allure.\n\nAfter a quick glance at the online menu it was decided. I had to explore this beast.\n\nSpecialising in British-Fusion cuisine with a heavy fine-dining vibe, I imagine Michael Neave will be a name that'll be bouncing around Edinburgh fairly soon. They offer a plentiful array of menus to suit the time of day or even the week, examples being their Mon-Fri Express Lunch Menu which offers an easy selection of 3 starts, mains and desserts, all of reasonable size in order to deliver and devour quickly for those on the go.\n\nThe lunch menu on Saturdays however are bit meatier and it was this set-priced menu that we decided to partake in. \u00a312 for two courses or \u00a317 for three seemed too good to snub.\n\nFor my part I chose a starter and main, while Steph went for a main and dessert. Before all that we were given some of the best complimentary bread I've experienced. Lovely soft and just warm enough to melt the butter, the size was perfect.... well I say that but we did ask for another basket. It was awesome!\n\nThe restaurant is split into two, the dining area downstairs with a pre-dinner type bar on the ground floor. On arrival we were offered a drink and seat in the bar before eating, which we politely declined, but I was impressed by the manner of the staff and the general idea. I can see this working well on busier evenings when tables are running over.\n\nAt our table I did have an Amaretto Sour (sans egg white - yeuch!) to see what thei mixologist was capable of, and he didn't disappoint. Very nice. Their cocktail menu is a mix of safe favourites with a couple of tasty=sounding newbies thrown in to mix it up a bit.\n\nThe staff were friendly, chatty and polite, although I must say I'm not a fan of waiters coming over mid-meal and asking how things are; I'll complain if it's not good so they don't need to ask. Bit too formal a touch but I can forgive them this as  A) to look at the place I would expect this treatment, and B) the food was just too terrific for me to care about that.\n\nFor starter I chose the Sea Bass with Avocado and Tomato Salsa, a lovely blend of hot and cold, the skin was crisped nicely on top and the meat was succulent and tasty. Not something I'd always choose but ultimately I was glad I decided to go for something outwith my usual taste.\n\nMains saw Steph go for the Tomato and Green Pepper Gnocchi in Cream Sauce and I couldn't see past the Pigeon and Venison Casserole with Dumplings from the moment I logged into their website. The casserole was spot on, the pigeon fantastic and the venison plentiful, a touch dry in spots but they were outweighed by the better bits and there was so much of it that all was forgiven. The gnocchi also was pretty good and if there wasn't so much delectable meat on the menu I might have even chose this now knowing how good it is.\n\nOne thing of particular note was the vegetarian options Michael Neave had on offer. Not that I take note of that sort of thing but definitely the best menu I've seen recently for veggies fine dining.\n\nSteph's dessert was a cracker. Chocolate and Cranberry Brownie with Bourbon Marmalade Ice Cream, the latter of which just so happened to have been made up fresh a few minutes before by the creative chef, which our waiter asked if we would care to try. The brownie was ridiculously crumbly, just warm enough and oh so chocolatey. And the ice cream.... SOOO boozy, it was wicked. Although it did lose it's flavour after a couple of mouthfuls, those first couple of spoons were very memorable.\n\nLooking at their ala carte menu it's safe to say I'll be back. The chefs have spent a lot of time and effort creating some original gems here, it would be rude not to take them up on the delights they are offering here,\n\nRecommended.

The Butternut Squash Gnocci was BY and FAR the best vegetarian meal I have had in Edinburgh... This is not to lessen the impressiveness  the standards there is a FINE selection of meals that I love dearly here. But not ONE came EVEN CLOSE. Michael... if you are looking for a wife.

Blink and you'll miss it or ignore it for its annoyingly prime location with way too many tourist traps around. But this place is a GEM. \n\nYou walk in and the two adorable waiters/hosts, impeccably dressed I might add, are there to meet and greet. The bar is cool, definitely a place I would enjoy an overly expensive cocktail whilst a date and I wait for our table (if he's paying... if not, I'll have the beer). Then we go downstairs and on the table there are some of my favorite flowers on the table... (which I have only recently realized I don't know the name of).\n\nThe food. The one star loss is simply for the completely irrational idea that we needed BOTTLED STILL WATER. For real? We're in Scotland! That shit comes off frozen peaks of the Pentlands - I don't want bottled water, the tap is fine.  \n\nNow the good stuff. And I am a picky jerk when it comes to fancy restaurants because well, I don't really eat meat... and when you don't really eat meat at a nice restaurant (I'm talking to you MARK GREENAWAY AND STOCKBRIDGE (see my other reviews)) you get treated like a SECOND CLASS CITIZEN in this city. \n\nOh but not here. Michael the freakish savant loves vegetarians. He even loves us pescatarians more. And there were A GAZILLION THINGS on the menu I could eat! I was in fancy shit heaven. \n\nI opted for the tomato and green pepper gnocci which, let me tell you, my Italian grandma, dead or not, would agree that this dude knows how to cook him some potato pasta. I'm going to make a statement where the word LITERALLY (as Joe would be proud of) is used correctly. This gnocci was LITERALLY the most well made gnocci I have ever in my whole life tasted and I have been to Italy, my family is Italian-American and I have had a very handsome Italian man make me a bowl and then do romantic and slightly filthy things to me and STILL... STILL... Michael, your gnocci wins. Hands down. \n\nThen there was the cranberry brownie and that was OBVIOUSLY awesome cause it's a brownie and there's cranberries in it. \n\nBut the winner was the bread. As always, true to my American Ethnicity... the free bread made my life better. \n\nThank you Joe for showing me the way, both literally and figuratively.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 2, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "Three vistis in 6 days says it all really.

Only another 3 bucks for a yummy dessert! However.... In true 'Laura and Elaine' style we ended up choosing from the al a carte, the steak just too tempting an option for me to pass up. \n\nMy olive and mull cheddar tart was divine as were the tiny, warm homemade sun dried tomato bread rolls (I asked for more... Well I WAS hungover!!) which were served with your own individual serving of butter. Yum. Elaine's pigeon breast with smoky bacon also went down a storm. I had a taste and the thick lardons of bacon were delish and really made a difference. \n\nMy steak was tasty, I asked for medium well and although it was slightly done a little more well, i really didn't mind. It was seasoned beautifully but simply, the right mix of saltiness and spice. The fondant potato that came with it could have gone wrong (as they so often do) but it was perfect! Soft fluffy potato. It soaked up the nice bottle of French white wine we had nicely. \n\nDessert. Well. This was a slight let down but before I continue, they redeemed themselves more than I could have expected so I'm not marking them down. I chose sticky toffee pudding which I'd spied immediately upon first seeing the menu and it didn't matter what else I was eating I WAS HAVING THAT PUDDING!! So....It did look lovely but it had a funny taste which I couldn't place... Kind of doughy, like it wasn't cooked properly. Gutted.com! For once the waiter was nowhere to be seen so it sat uneaten for about 15 mins before he came back into the restaurant. I explained I didn't like the taste - was this a problem for them? No! He immediately apologised and I was offered something else. I chose the pistachio and elderflower parfait which was lovely, tart and creamy. \n\nAnother 2 glasses of wine and some coffee and we were ready to leave. Upon presenting the bill the waiter said BOTH desserts and BOTH glasses of wine were on the house with the apologies from the chef!! This goes to show, it's not about the mistake, it's how it's rectified! \n\nThe shame was the place was empty. On a sat afternoon! I know they are trying to build up custom slowly but they do deserve to be busy...

And whilst my meal was nice, it didn't knock my socks off or even make my toes tingle a little bit.\n\n\u00a37.95 for 3 courses is a fantastic deal, especially considering MN is going for fine dining. I had the venison terrine, beef and then we all had the brownie as dessert.\n\nThe terrine was lacking flavour. It was a nice portion size, and I did eat it all; but having just had venison and chilli the night before at a deli in Glasgow that I can still taste, this was quite bland. A few bit of chewy fat in there too.\n\nThe beef was a little dry and chewy in parts. Not a cut that would lend itself to being medium rare, and the sauce gave it flavour. An ample serving too. Again, however, the side of new potatoes with some butter needed a lot of pepper and seasoning.\n\nI rarely season, if ever, and never with salt unless it's a few crystals of Maldon sea salt. So to have to add pepper to my potatoes, and wish I'd done the same to the venison, just wasn't great.\n\nThe brownie, with cherries, was rich and stodgy and mainly tasting of cocoa. Nice, again, but not a touch on the Peter's Yard chocolate and cheesecake brownie; or the Peppers brownies; or, well, a lot of other brownies I've had.\n\nSo overall this was a perfectly fine meal, and I can't sniff at the good value.

But, it's very real and in a beautiful 16th century historic building. A very cool and other-worldly ambience. We sat in the Secret Garden area downstairs...loved it....no stars lost. \n\nService - Fair. Attentive when they were around. But, too slow for me. Big delay between apps and main course even though we were the 2nd table seated.

Judy had a Pimm's, wife had a glass of sauv blanc and I had a Hendrick's Martini with a cuke garnish. Plus, after-lunch cappuccino's were excellent...1 star awarded (they're back to 5 stars!).\n\nApps - Underwhelmed. A selection of bread and butter was served. Bread seemed day-old and cold but tasted OK. I prefer warm bread. Wife had oysters on the half shell and they were reported to be good. I had a seafood bisque and it was presented nicely in an iron pot with crostini (croutons) and parmesan and rouille on the side. But, it was a vey thin soup that didn't have a distinct flavor....I'm sure it was a lot of work but it just tasted like some basic fish stock. I usually think of a bisque as being thicker and richer but this may just be a cultural thing. It was neither good nor bad....1 star lost.\n\nMain Course - This one is tricky. Kids split the roasted chicken with fondant potato and green beans and chips on the side. My wife and Judy got the roasted, hot-smoked salmon with sweet potatoes and green beans. My mother-in-law Mary and I both got Guy Grieve's scallops w/ pancetta and whipped potatoes. Here's the rundown...kids' chicken had good flavor but was very dry....seemed like it may have sat for a while. Their chips were very good, though. The salmon was reported from wife and Judy as being simple but very good. Seems like it had a lemon/butter-based sauce with it and served with green beans. They really liked the dish. Everything about the scallop dish was mediocre. Whipped potatoes were cold (ok, luke warm), scallops were over cooked or had been sitting under a salamander for too long. Pancetta was hard and chewy. Salad was not memorable....1 star lost.\n\nSo, it was an OK experience in the end. My wife and Judy enjoyed their meals. Mary and I didn't. All agreed the service was not the best.

I'm not spoiling anything.  This is not a predictable plot with a Shyamalan-like fifth act twist.  By saying this early, I can make you wet your imaginative appetites (see what I did there) as you contemplate how this place could possibly look better that Inamo or Claridge's. \nThe Witchery matches Claridge's in their dedication to offering a fine dining experience over just good food.  I've been thinking about that, about how I prefer to have a dining experience.  I would never go out \"to get food.\"  \"Let's get something to eat\" would be replaced with \"Let's go out tonight.\"  This is why I haven't eaten fast food in five years.  I go out for the treatment and the experience as much as the food eaten.  As I sat down and took my first glance at the menu, I knew I was in good hands.  Our third water had come down with water after the second had brought the menus.  As the rain fell outside, we enjoyed the warmth of the Witchery.\nAnd then we ordered haggis.\nI know what you were thinking with that statement.  \"...and this was when it went downhill.\"  Haggis has a rather tepid reputation amongst westerners, squarely because of various negative images and connotations.  For me it, it was Highlander, where a French actor playing a Scotsman explains what haggis is to a Scottish actor playing an Egyptian.  When hearing that haggis was sheep's stomach stuffed with meat and barley, the Egyptian played by the Scotsman retorts, \"How revolting!\"\nBut let's analyze what haggis really is.  To do that, you must come face to face with the realization that you've been eating its brother for most of your life. Sausage, it's the same stuff in a different package.  Where haggis employs a stomach, sausage uses intestines.  This process continues today, though most industrial manufacturers have cheapened out and switched to synthetic cases.  So haggis can be looked upon as just a sausage ball.  How much harm could come from that?\nYou're probably thinking the other shoe is going to drop, but no.  The haggis was the first ordered, the first arrived, and was so overwhelming delicious that it sullied all dishes to follow.  The skin gave way the moment you scared it with the fork.  I'm so hooked on haggis now; I could eat it for breakfast, second breakfast, elevensies, luncheon, afternoon tea, dinner, and supper.  It was so good; I'd forgotten to take a photo.  I know; I'm naval lint.  The haggis was 9.50 and a bargain.  From there, we took in the d'Hote Menu, basically what we have been doing nearly everywhere else.  Between meals were offers of bread, the same as Claridge's.  My mother ordered wine to my water, the same as Claridge's.  Three courses were 30 quid.  Does that sound good?  It's less than half than Claridge's, so this place just got an A+ in value.  The actual starter after the haggis was offered as three options.  My mother elected for the grilled Irish oysters, pancetta, spinach, and hollandaise while I had the Tamworth ham hock en gel\u00e9e, piccalilli, with grain mustard mayonnaise.  And you couldn't have a more complicated and more delicious way of saying \"spreadable meat and mayo on bread.\"\nWe both decided the main should be the grilled gigot of new season lamb, rosemary potato cake, with aubergine caviar and tomato jus.  Alas, this is where the Witchery falters.  We must have been missing a point to this because the lamb was almost entirely fat.  It was a nearly inedible minefield of grizzle forcing us both to spit portions back onto plate like we were Gordon Ramsey in a kitchen nightmare.  The sides were good but this meal was ultimately a disappointment... what a shame.  In retrospect, I should have gone for my first choice, the butter-poached potato gnocchi with garden peas, broad beans, ricotta and mint.  The mean was redeemed with organic carrot cake topped with mascarpone ice cream blueberry syrup. \nThe Witchery was sizing up to be the greatest restaurant of the trip.  It did everything else to perfection, from service to d\u00e9cor, to every other dish.  It still gets extremely high praise from me because this one poor dish just wasn't enough to sour the entire experience.  I would definitely return.  I would also say that you won't regret going and should do so, just avoid the lamb.\nFood:  8/10\nService: 10/10\nPresentation:  10/10\nValue:  8/10\nRecommendation:  9.3/10", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I have a hard time giving high-rated restaurants five stars, but The Witchery definitely deserved it!

The greek salad is also pretty respectable, with a hefty amount of kalamata olives and feta cheese. \n\nWatching the cooks at work is part of the fun at this place, so have a seat at the bar. Just make sure to do so far enough away from the oven that you won't end up dried out like beef jerky at the end of your meal. When you get the bill, there's a cashier near the door that you can cash out at if you're in a hurry, since the servers are a little bit on the slow side. Slow, laid back, whatever. \n\nTheir happy hour is also an awesome option to opt for, and is offered every day from 3 to 5 pm. There's a dollar off beers, three dollar Irish car bombs and two dollar top shelf shots (Ketel One vodka, Jameson whiskey, etc.), so if you're looking to spend an afternoon getting stinko and munching on some awesome food, this is the place to be.\n\nUPDATE: I've tried just about every non-veggie pasty on the menu.

(4) The decor is sleek and modern, complete with classic rock playing at a quiet yet audible volume.\n\nWhat they could improve on:  There's very little room for parties of 4.  There's plenty of counter space, a handful of tables for 2, and a custom table for 3 that's kind of neat, but the small area at the back that used to be smaller tables is now one large table.  Parties of 4 now take up the whole area (that could seat up to 8), making it awkward for any other big parties coming in.

You have to scoot down the length of the table and then push everyone out again if you have to get up for any reason.

The recipes are so varied, from the Royal with Cheese to the Lamb Vindaloo and the Lovely Bit of Salmon, that I can't even pick a favorite. If I go there 10 different times, I'll eat ten different pasties. They're hand-made each day, including the dough.

E.g  every  British theme pub has one on the menu  and seem to share the  same supplier.\n\nThis was so much better than I had hoped.

There wasn't a lot of variety in the UK diet,  less so on the working class end. So   On to the food.   Everything about the decor,  waiting time and suitability for groups is true.  Staff are friendly and  frankly it's nice to be left alone   rather than constant hovering. \n\nOnto the food. Pastry  rocks,  they've nailed it.   It supports the  contents right to the last.   \n\nFillings I had the Lamb Vindaloo which was close, but, but missing a sharpness/ e.g  vinegar, that I usually look for but it was still really good.  Dipping sauce complements it nicely.  My wife had the banger's and mash  version with  a red wine sauce.  Again  pretty good. \n\nSo why  four stars?    Many comments here have mentioned a lack of sensitivity  with regards to the flavors/ herbs and the thyme was   way overused on the bangers/mash gravy and it's  a shame as you could taste what they were trying to get at.

I have learned to order one pasty for lunch, and get another to-go for later-- because knowing me, I will have a second craving during the day.\n\n  The first time I went I courageously tried their Chicken Tikka Masala pasty. My grandfather is from India, and I was raised on traditional Indian food, so I was a skeptic. However, their take on chicken masala (typically consisting of chicken, red curry, potatoes, vegetables and accompanied with rice) was impressive. There was just the right amount of curry to chicken to vegetable ratio, and I could not help but want to scarf it down. It was mild, so anyone could love it. Even their Vegetarian Tikka Masala pasty is delicious. As a former vegetarian and vegan, I am always skeptical when trying new meat substitutes, but the Quorn chicken substitute has a great consistency. \n \nAnother time I went, I tried their Shepherd's Pie Pasty, and declared that a victory. The pastry shell was crisp, the filling was flavorful, and the peas and carrots hadn't gone to mush. You can tell that they make the pasties (pastys?) fresh just by biting into them, but if you're not convinced, sit up at the bar and watch. \n\n  I will say, one of the best pasties they have is their Lovely Bit a Salmon. It took me a while to be able to order it because every time I tried, they were sold out (AND FOR GOOD REASONING!). I got lucky one unassuming Tuesday afternoon while ordering delivery for my mother, my roommate and myself. They were surprisingly prompt in their delivery and didn't seem to get lost with my crappy directions to my apartment. I ordered the Salmon, my mother the Pilgrim (SOOOO GOOD), and my roommate the Cheese Steak ( I didn't try his, but he said it was awesome). The Salmon pasty was heaven. I am not kidding- HEAVEN wrapped in a delicate pastry blanket and hand delivered from The Almighty Himself. The salmon was cooked to perfection, the dill sauce was mild, the asparagus still al dente, the potatoes were perfect, and the tomatoes and spinach were an added plus. \n\n My new favorite \"every-now-and-again\" pasty is The Peanut Butter and Jelly. HOLY GUACAMOLE! They have taken the traditional PB&J and slapped it in the face sent it home to it's momma. Then added some refinement, and some ooey-gooey, yummy in my tummy, goody-goody gumdrops to it. Holy Toledo. The banana is welcomed added bonus.  \n \nTo be honest, I have yet to try a pasty there that I do not like. This is a great thing, yet can be very unhelpful when trying to figure out what to have for lunch or dinner. \n\n Maybe someone can help me... I do not know what is in their salad dressing for their basic green salad... but it is AMAZING! \n Their garlic roasted potatoes and mushy peas are so yummy as well. \n\n They have my two drink requirements on tap: Guinness and Boddingtons. Also, they have Duvel which is one of my favorite Belgian beers for a moderate price. They have great Happy Hour drink specials including $3 car bombs. $3!

What really made this pasty delish was the cream sauce that accompanied it. I brought the heat down while complimenting the flavor. When all was said and done I was stuffed and had leftovers. We also go the garlic mashed potatoes which are equally as amazing but I would advise against getting them for take-out because they only taste good fresh.

This place is awesome. \n    The Cornish Pasty is located on the side of a very random and small strip mall, if you didn't know you were looking for it you would probably not even notice it. It is small on the inside, a narrow straight corridor with, I believe, nine table, most of them two seaters, and while it has no big budget decorations, it is completely inviting and welcoming. It just feels right inside, a combination of old mining photos and 1940's country, a bare floor and a huge bar with completely open kitchen area to chat with the cooks while imbibing. We have consistently had great service when eating here, the waiters and waitresses are always very friendly and talkative, it's a fun place to be. \nThe food is top notch and super cheap, you can leave totally full and pay less than ten bucks, incredible. We have probably been here a couple dozen times and I have tried a large majority of the menu and have not found a pasty I didn't enjoy yet. Kristen's favorites are the Italian, which is pepperoni, salami, ham, mozzarella, basil and tomatoes with a marinara dipping sauce and the Pilgrim, which is turkey, sweet potatoes, grilled onions, stuffing and a red wine gravy, and I can attest, they are both delicious. My favorites are the Mexican, which is spiced steak strips, potatoes, eggs, hatch chilies and cheddar with a side of sour cream and the Shepard's Pie, which is lamb, peas, carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes and cheddar with a side of gravy, these are both like heaven in your mouth. And if you enjoy the occasional beer, Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar is my favorite and they have it on tap, they actually have a pretty good selection of brews. \n    If you have not tried the Cornish Pasty Company yet, you are doing yourself a great disservice, you can stop by today and get a cold beer a warm pasty and a full stomach for well under twenty bucks.

I have become addicted to the cajun with it's spicy chicken, ham, and cheesy goodness. My girlfriend always seems to order the veggie tikka masala. I have tried much of the menu, and as long as you stay with the pasties, you are fine. The potato dishes are sort of hit and miss. The cheesy one is sort of bland  and the curried potato lacks the crunchiness that would otherwise put it on a great tapas menu. Finally, I would add that the beer selection is quite good and offers several sizes of great draft beers from the British Isles.\n\nSo yeah, food is great, and for dine in the prices are decent. My big frustration, and the reason I am writing this has to do with my experience tonight. I have taken to ordering pasties to go because the wait staff is often slow or inattentive. This is normally fine because I can stay at home and watch a movie while I eat. Indeed, I have been trying to save money by ordering half-baked pasties, and in the past they have knocked a dollar off of each of the pasties I've ordered regardless of type. Tonight I ordered two half-baked pasties to take home and the woman operating the cash register refused to give me the usual dollar off.

The half moon shaped baked pastry filled with meat and vegetables was designed as a lunch for soot-covered Cornish tin miners. To eat it, miners would hold the pasty at the crimped edge, and then discard that part after eating the rest of the pasty. This way the miners didn't eat the dirt they were covered in, missing out on ingesting stuff like arsenic that was common in the mines. While most tin mining is gone, we're fortunate to have the Cornish Pasty Co., which specializes in pasties.\n\nWith restaurants in Tempe and Mesa, each location has its own spirit. While both are laid back, the Tempe location has a more subdued feel with dim lighting and no windows. Mesa has a brighter interior with indie rock blaring over the sound system.\n\nIf you enjoy watching kitchen action, belly up to the bar at either locale for a first-hand look into the hard work that goes into making their delicious pasties.\n\nAs soon as I entered the Tempe location, the warm smell of wine gravy and fresh baked crust covered me like a blanket of mouth-watering comfort. The feeling was like going home for the holidays. I know it's a million degrees outside, but the feeling transcends the summer heat.\n\nThe first pasty I tried, The Pilgrim ($8), exemplified everything that tastes good at Thanksgiving, luscious turkey breast, sweet potatoes, stuffing and grilled onions all wrapped in a tender crust, then served with a side of cranberry sauce. After one bite, I felt like I needed to pay thanks to someone.\n\nThe Porky ($7) is filled with all that is good: pork, apples, potatoes, onions and sage and served with a side of red wine gravy. The problem with the gravy is that it's so tasty I'm not sure whether to dunk my pasty into it or drink it.\n\nNever able to resist a good burger, I decided to take a chance with the Royale with Cheese ($7.50). Ordered medium, this pasty was brimming with a juicy hamburger, French fries and cheese and served with a side of Thousand Island dressing. As the meat juices ran down my face, I couldn't help but think of the scene in Pulp Fiction where John Travolta explains to Samuel Jackson what the name of a Quarter Pounder with Cheese is in Amsterdam.\n\nThe Peanut Butter and Jelly ($5) was served piping hot. One bite of this was not going to be enough. Filled with creamy peanut butter, raspberry preserves and sliced banana, the sweet goodness oozed out after the first cut was made.

We ended up ordering a cheese steak pasty and a chicken tikka masala pasty. I was extremely skeptical and thought I was going to be in for a big disappointment. What business did this British pub even have THINKING about chicken tikka masala? To my surprise, I think I just tasted the BEST CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA IN PHOENIX. Hold up, Cornish Pasty Company, a BRITISH type PUB HAS THE BEST CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA in PHOENIX. I know, you must think I'm nuts, but I'm Indian and I thoroughly enjoyed this amazing interpretation of a stereotypical Indian dish. The tikka masala overshadowed the cheesesteak which I thought was rather bland. I think the issue here was that the chicken tikka was so overwhelmingly awesome. I can't wait to go back and have the tikka masala again and perhaps try something else.\n\nEverything here is super fresh, you can see them making the pasties and dough and everything. The pasties have a perfect texture and are golden brown on the outside. If you're unsure of what a pasty is, it is basically a chicken bake or calzone, but with different fillings. Really awesome.\n\nIt'd be awesome if the owner of this place decided to get a few TVs, then it'd be even more pub like.

First off, before eating here I didn't even know meat pies existed.  It was like an awesome burrito but with a flaky crust and WAY more choices.  When I lived in Tempe I was a terribly picky eater and every single time I came in I got the same thing, the meatball pasty.  It was awesome, everytime.  Everything on the menu looks delicious and it looks like the flavors blend together very well.  They are premade before you get there, so you cant really have them take ingredients out, although I am sure if you let them know ahead of time it can be arranged.\n\nSo there are 2 things I would like to talk about here.  First, the atmosphere.  Walking in you have a tiny restaurant that has a bar on one side and some small tables against the wall.  All the waiters are tatted up and lend an air of ruggedness to the joint.  As you sit at the bar, they are right in front of you rolling up the pasties and behind them are the stoves that they bake your pies in after you order them.  So basically you are sitting at a bar, drinking a cold beer and you can feel the heat from the ovens.  In some places this would be annoying, but again I feel like it lends greatness to the atmosphere.  The music is usually some good British rock and once again, yes, lends to the atmosphere.  So I enjoy feeling like I am in some tiny pub in Cornwall.\n\nSecond, THE DESSERT!  I will start with the Strawberry Pavlova which I could have done without.  The meringue shell is light and unless that is your cup of tea, keep on reading.  The PB&J pasty I only had one time and it was good, but second rate for me compared to the next two items.  Next up is the caramel apple pasty.  Delish!  Apple and caramel baked into the pie shell and topped with ice cream.  However nothing in this world can touch the BANOFFEE Pie!  Dig this real quick, a thick graham cracker pie crust.  Top that with caramel.  Top that with whipped cream and top that with bananas.  Oh, and if you are crazy ask them for strawberries too...and ice cream.  Now eat that and tell me you've had a better dessert.

Given all the great reviews this place has gotten, I was wondering what I could add that hasn't already been said.  It's not only the only place in Tempe you can get a cornish pasty, but they are also freak'n awesome.  The Lovely Bit of Salmon was my favorite, but alas given my newly discovered gluten intolerance I am not able to part-take in such loveliness any more:  :(\n\nBut nevertheless, I still come here every now and then with my friends and husband.  They all chow down on the yummy pasties while I chow down on my salads, sides, and soups.  So, I decided to concentrate my review on those items. (Some of these dishes are not gluten free.  I had them before I found out about my gluten intolerance.) \n\nSoups:\nThey offer a variety of soups.  I have tried: 1) the cream of leek, potato, and stilton, 2) the cream of tomato and crouton, and 3) the red pepper, black bean, rice, chicken, and jalapeno.  They were all very good, but I was informed that only the red pepper one is gluten free.  I had the first two before I found out about my gluten intolerance.  Not only are their soups really tasty, full of flavor, they are all also accompanied by thick slices of fresh bread and butter, baked and churned in-house.  Absolutely delicious!  The are perfect accompaniments, and a bowl at $4.75 would make a tasty and light lunch that won't break the bank.  \n\nSides: \nThe garlic mashed potatoes and the garlic roasted potatoes are also very good.  Pretty much what you should expect.  Creamy mashed potatoes and nicely roasted red potatoes with a hint of garlic.  Not too garlicky.  \n\nThe mushy peas is one of my favorite side dishes that they serve.  I think I prefer them to the potatoes simply because they are something different that I can't get anywhere else.  And these ain't  no ordinary peas.  They are huge for peas.  Cooked really well.  Not too mushy (overcooked), even though they are \"mushy\" peas. There is a great texture and freshness to this dish.  The texture of these \"mushy peas\" is more like crunchy peanut butter than creamy peanut butter if we were speaking of peanut butter that is (it's an analogy. . . just go with it), and I think the freshness and the texture go hand in hand from not overcooking the peas.  \n\nThe broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake is also a nice dish.  It makes me think of mac'n cheese, but with cauliflower and broccoli instead of mac noodles.  I dont think this dish is gluten free.  It seems to be made with a cheese sauce that is thickened with a flour rue, then baked to give a nice golden, crusted top.  It was tasty as well, but could have used a bit more seasoning.  It was my least favorite of all the sides I have had. \n\nAll their salads are also pretty good.  The veggies in the salad are pretty much the same regardless of which salad you get: ice berg lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions.  Except for the Greek and pasta.  The Greek has feta and olives, and the pasta has a whole list of its own ingredients.  \n\nWhat differentiates the various salads are the additions and the dressing.  Beside the basic garden and Greek, the three other salads to choose from are: 1) the salmon or chicken caesar, 2) the chicken tikka salad, and 3) the sausage salad.  The salmon caesar is a great substitute for the Lovely Bit of Salmon pasty.  The salmon is cooked very well.  Juicy, not overcooked and not undercooked, seasoned just like the salmon in the Lovely Bit of Salmon.  Ask for a side of the white wine and dill dressing that usually accompanies the Lovely Bit of Salmon and you will not regret it.  That sauce is amazing.  This is my favorite salad. The chicken tikka is also good.  The chicken is marinated in a red rub or spice, like what you would find with tandoori chicken, and served on a salad with yogurt dressing.  Finally, the sausage salad was not my favorite.  They make the sausage in house, but I was a bit disappointed with the flavor and the way it was cooked.  It was overcooked, very dry, and a bit off.  I'm not sure if I would order it again.

Places that do one thing and do it well rate highly with me, and this place does pasties.

The business acumen is very important and should be a learning tool to teach the college kids the important lessons which can be applied to all different job titles.

I first went to Cornish Pasty in 05' a few months after they opened and fell in love immediately. Although a few things have changed over the years each one is usually an improvement and never a negative. \n\nIf you are not familiar, a pasty is a traditional British coal miners food.  A hearty filling wrapped in a pie crust and baked. Kind of a hand-held meat pie. Cornish Pasty Co. has taken this simple and traditional dish and meticulously perfected each component. Their crusts are some how simultaneously hearty and flaky. Although their is nothing delicate about their seasoning it is never out of balance and all of the ingredients are always quality. \n\nBeyond just mastering the finer details of pasty science, Cornish Pasty Co. has also branched off into wild and exotic flavors. It's no shocker that the British know Indian food and it shows with the tika masala and the lamb vindaloo pasties. What is shocking is the refinement of the Greek and Italian inspired pasties. Perhaps my favorite pasty, from the cuisine most elusive to the British, is the Carne Avadado. This is a Mexican inspired pasty that will satisfy even the most snobby Las Cruses/El Paso foodie. If you have ever talked Mexican food with one you will know just what I mean. \n\nI have eaten nearly every item on the menu and not a one disappoints. It took me ages to get past the pasties and start ordering soups and salads. Now that I have had the spinach, mushroom, walnut soup, it is difficult to save room for my old favorites. \n\nAlthough the mine shaft inspired interior is dark and cramped I have never felt uncomfortable there. The sound system is usually bumping classic rock and the employees are pierced and tattooed well beyond your typical wait staff, but everyone is friendly and service is typically good.\n\nIf I have to list a negative the only one I can think of is the food is consistently just a little better at the University location than the Dobson one.  No clue why, but everyone I've talk to seems to agree, the Tempe store has the edge on quality.  \n\nAfter you add a respectable selection of beers the only reason you won't be here every night is your waist line.\n\n\nEdit (4/30/2014):\n\nFood's still good... but...  \n\nThe service has gone down hill.

An eclectic list of Pasty's both 'traditional,' 'signature,' and 'premium' plus a collection of soups, salads, and sides I asked Hannah about portions on her return and told that each pasty clocked in at approximately a pound (and that two would be \"way too much\" food for a solo diner since she could only eat half of one) thus leading me to settle on a single option, a dish I was told would take \"about fifteen minutes,\" leaving me more time to study and enjoy the tunes - the White Stripes perhaps the only thing 'un-British' in a string of songs ranging from Zeppelin to The Beatles to The Ramones.\n\nReading as I waited and enjoying the room as well as watching the team slice meat, shape dough, and chop vegetables it would be just under a quarter hour before my dish arrived and although smaller than I'd imagined (I definitely could have eaten two - probably three if I didn't have dessert and dinner plans) the Shepherd's Pie that was presented was far better than I'd have ever expected, a golden buttery shell wrapped around lightly mint tinged lamb and although fatty and intense nicely balanced by the vegetables.  Generally a fan of Shepherd's Pie, particularly when using a sharp cheddar, this handheld version would prove to be an exemplary take on the classic and the addition of a sidecar of onion and sage laden red wine gravy certainly did not hurt.\n\nDebating a second pasty as Hannah returned to check in on me (The Pilgrim sounds quite good) but subsequently turning my attention to the sweeter half of the menu I decided to not make the same mistake twice and inquiring as to which dessert she recommended I went with my gut and ordered two to arrive with a delay between them, the first \"Shirley Temple's Pudding,\" a $6 sticky toffee pudding served in a cast iron pot with a side of cr\u00e8me anglaise.  Rich and thick, a dark treacle just barely set at the center and almost a brownie consistency along the edges what really shined about this dish was the manner in which it worked with the cr\u00e8me, a thick but delicate sauce balancing out the intense sweetness of the pudding.\n\nMoving next to my second dessert, and for my tastes the better of the two, a goodly delay of fifteen minutes brought to the table Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding with vanilla ice cream - a truly unique spin on bread pudding made with what almost seemed to be cracker-thin pieces of bread juxtaposing a brandy tinged chocolate sauce and baked much like the sticky toffee pudding to be set at the edges yet dense and moist at the center.  Truly a decadent dessert - the sort begging for a glass of milk or coffee - I will say that the ice cream was rather run-of-the-mill vanilla and although it served its purpose admirably I'd definitely go with more anglaise on subsequent visits - visits which I'm sure will happen the next time I find myself drawn back to Tempe, or to Mesa where there is apparently a second location whose Banoffee Pie and Apple Caramel Pasties seem to be calling.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 5, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "THIS PLACE IS GREAT. \nNot only is the vibe and atmosphere so much fun but the beer and food is one of a kind.

The Royales is basically a cheeseburger stuck inside the delicious, warm, buttery crust.  It had a weird garlic taste to it, which I didn't care for.

Fantasies of red-bearded drunks with pots of gold dancing in shamrock fields had always accompanied the notorious rainbow in my childlike imagination, but I was wrong. The Cornish own the rainbow. Let me explain:\n\nI became stranded in the Arizona desert one day when my Pinto got not one, but four flat tires. (Hit a hot speed bump and the tires melted right off.) I realized that I didn't have any food or water. At that moment, I knew I'd be fighting for my life.\n\nMy heart began to race. I was on the verge of having a panic attack. I had to settle myself down. I took a few deep breaths and knew what I needed--smooth jazz. I turned the radio to 95.5 KYOT. But I couldn't believe my ears. Coolio's \"Gangsta's Paradise\" was blaring through my speakers. Projectile vomit shot out my mouth. Had my entire childhood been sold down the dry riverbed? I thought God was playing a sick trick on me. I shuffled through radio stations faster than old people shuffle board. But it was true. Thee \"Coyote\" sold out.\n\nAll hope had been lost. My spirit was shattered, and the little moisture I had left was now a soggy puddle in the passenger's seat. I was in a dire situation. In desperation, I checked between the seat cushions hoping to find some crumbs to eat but instead found a few petrified McDonald french fries. I looked at them and thought to myself: \"I'd rather eat pigeon crap.\" I flicked the measly fries out of my Pinto then used my finger to write a goodbye message on the dirty windshield and began my trek amid the arid desert. \n\nAs far as I could see, nothing but cacti and cheap Mexican food restaurants. The little vegetation was riddled with thorns and bore no fruit. The thought of a carne asada burrito tempted me like a mirage, but I knew the explosive diarrhea I'd get would dry me out quicker than a sponge in the sun. I had to stay strong and keep going. \n\nAfter four long minutes of walking, I gave up. The sun leached my energy and exhausted all remaining calories. The horizon held no signs of hope. Just signs for Filiberto's, Amado's, Los Favorito's, Armando's, Pedrito's, and Taco Bell. My pasty skin was turning pink and my balls looked like raisins, so I sat in the shade of a palo verde tree and prayed. I begged God not to let me die. I repented my sins. I promised that if he let me live I'd never do anything bad ever again.\n\nThen, out of the blue, I felt drops of wetness on my bald scalp. I turned my head up to the sky and saw that a pigeon was dropping deuces from the branch above. I knew Jesus turned water into wine, but I had no idea He could read minds. (I guess He wasn't too fond of me flicking french fries onto the desert ground.) God trickled the sign I was begging for right on my forehead, and now He was now putting me to the test. If I wanted to be saved, I'd have to eat this pigeon poo. So, I bowed my head, placed my palms together, and said grace. \n\nThere was a trembling rumble that echoed across the desert and it wasn't the sound of me regurgitating. As I stood up from the gravel to peer into abyss of newly formed clouds, a surge of water swept my legs out from under me. Before I knew it, I was being carried away in a flash flood. \n\nMy next memory was waking to the sound of chirping birds. I flinched and covered my face fearing that I may be lying under another pigeon-riddled palo verde. I opened my eyes and was blinded by colors. I didn't know what was going on. Vibrant reds, blues, yellows, and greens! I had no idea where I was. I suddenly got scared and pooped a Skittle. Then it hit me. You know when people say that it's impossible to reach the end of the rainbow? It's a lie. I was there. It's at the entrance of a mystical place called Cornish Pasty. \n\nI entered the land of the Cornish and it was like no place I'd ever been. I anticipated for there to be leprechauns. I encountered a species far more enchanting, with skins of the finest tapestries and earlobes so large and peculiar that they could double as tire swings. Apparently, I wasn't the first person to reach the End of the Rainbow, because this Cornish Pasty place was rather busy. I tracked down one of these Cornish creatures and told her my story, explaining how famished I was. She was unusually polite and let me sit in her earlobe until a seat opened up at a table. I swung around the restaurant as she went from table to table, filling mugs up with magically frothy beer. Then, I whispered in her ear: \"Are there pots of gold here?\" A spot at a table had opened up and she sat me down. She told me that she'd be right back. \n\nI sketched pictures of these Cornish creatures as I waited. The girl returned and placed a dish in front of me. She gave me a wink, then walked away. I grabbed the warm pocket of food that rested on the metal plate before me, stuffed it in my mouth, and died.\n\nIt was gold, my friends.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 7, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Seriously everything is delicious!

So why the three star review? Well, their food is great, but the service is lousy. But let me back up a bit.\n\nThe very first time someone told me about \"The Pasty,\" as I refer to it, they described a pasty as \"a gourmet hot pocket.\" Let me tell you, that did not sound appealing. Despite how great they tried to make it sound, I could not get over the idea of a gourmet hot pocket. So I never checked it out until maybe a year ago when I was recommended by another friend, and figured I'd just give it a shot. It was delightful!\n\nI've since been to The Pasty multiple times. It's the food that keeps me coming back. \"The Pilgrim\" is like Thanksgiving! I get it almost every time. It's a combination of turkey, sweet potatoes, onions, mushrooms, and other wonderful flavors inside. Served with a side of cranberry sauce and a red wine gravy. I'm not too crazy about the gravy, but the cranberry sauce is awesome. I've also tried their Greek salad and black bean soup, which are just as wonderful. I love the bread that comes with the soup, and the dressing on the salad.\n\nAlthough this location is closer to my house, I prefer going to the one on Guadalupe and Dobson because the service is slightly better (although both locations have poor service). And this location on University is way too dark and full of hipsters. But, I guess people dig that nowadays.\n\nThe main reason I'm writing this review is because of a trip I made to this location yesterday. I went with my boyfriend and we split all three items mentioned above. The Greek salad, black bean soup, and The Pilgrim. I was starving and was hoping our server would bring the soup and salad out first. I was thrilled when she came back after a couple minutes with the soup and was hoping the salad would come out shortly after. I love bread and when we ran out of bread (meaning after I scarfed all the bread down), I patiently waited for our server to come back around so I could ask for more bread, as well as the status on our salad. Remember when I said I was starving? Well, I start to get a little cranky when I'm hungry, and our server was not making any rounds to see how her tables were doing. After fifteen or so minutes, I decide to go over to where our server is talking with another server, and ask for more bread, nicely of course. Once she comes back with our bread, the soup is cold, but I don't really mind. I was just happy she put more bread in front of me. A few minutes later our pasty comes out. She had obviously forgotten about our salad (guess that's what happens when you don't write anything down) so I reminded her and she comes back shortly with it. Only after we had been sitting there for ten minutes after we had finished everything and the busser, who was much friendly than our server, had already cleared the table, did our server appear from the darkness and we were finally able to get our check, pay, and leave. I'm used to the service being not so great, but this was just awful.\n\nI thought maybe if I wrote a review about my last experience, they'd change the service up or hire better servers. Serving itself isn't very hard, I know, I've done it. And it doesn't take much effort to check up on a table. But the people who work at The Pasty just don't seem to care about anything. I guess that's just a hipster thing. (I would love to see their interview process, if there even is one. \"Do you know how to carry food?\" \"Yes.\" \"Okay, you're hired.\")\n\nAnyway, I think I will be driving out of the way to go to the other Pasty instead. Since their servers are a little more attentive and I can actually see who I'm eating with, and what I'm eating for that matter. Hah, I can only imagine what that place looks like in the light. Maybe they keep it dark for a reason.\n\nIt's not like I'm expecting five star service or anything, I get that it's a bar too. But come on.

This was a second time in just a few weeks I've had a \"Meh, I've had much better experience!\"  What has happened to Cornish Pasty???  So I felt compelled to write a review about my experiences so that others would know this Cornish Pasty is in need of some management/owner love/help or something.... \n\nService~ yikes! It was turrible, to quote Charles Barkley.  Both visits were the same experience but with different servers.  The servers here seem more interested in talking with each other rather than serving their customers.  On both visits we had to remind our server multiple times to refill our drinks and bring us condiments.  Probably the biggest disappointment is when we complained about our food.  They both were very disinterested in turning our poor dining experience into a positive one.  When we asked to speak to someone in charge in our 2nd turrible visit the waitress disappeared!  I kid you not!  She never came back and when we asked the bartender about her she stated that she went on a break....\n\nFood~ prior visits we've had a pretty good experience trying the different pasty's however lately their food has not been up to par!  The pasty's are very dry lately for some reason and they lack flavor.  This last visit we had the bangers and mash, chicken and the traditional beef and potatoes.  We also had a couple of side of fries and some salads.  The salads and fries were the best parts of our dining experience again unfortunately.  The banger and mash was ok.  It had a good balance of bangers to mash but had too much onions.  Since when did onions become a major star in this pasty?  The chicken pasty was not filled completely and was very dry.  The waitress suggested the red wine sauce to help?? WTH?  NO THE RED WINE SAUCE DOES NOT GO WELL WITH ALL PASTY'S, ESPECIALLY THEIR CHICKEN PASTY! It was gross!  We asked for a different sauce.   The waitress stated that was their only sauce but she could bring us ketchup and that's what a lot of people use.  Yes she did say that! If a lot of people are requesting ketchup, the cook, heck the owner needs to know their customers are having to douse their pasty's in ketchup because they are too dry.  The beef and potato pasty was more potato than beef and yes it was arid dry as the desert....\n\nSo for both visits I give this Cornish Pasty 2 stars because of their salad and fries.

From the sound of things, it was a hot pocket/pie sandwich type deal. They mentioned an array of options from pepperoni to peppered steak etc. All that being said, decided we should go there for dinner the night before I left Arizona. Especially after I saw 860 reviews with 4.5 stars up here on yelp. That's virtually unreal. Never had seen such ratings with as many reviews. Any who, drove up to what looked like a dead shopping strip with a bunch of stores/restaurants that looked closed due to the dark tint of the windows. When we opened the door though, it was actually pretty mind blowing. Walked around from what I guess was the front door to the bar side. Honestly, first thing I thought coming around that corner was that this place looked like something off the set of man vs food. Can't really explain it but if you're familiar with the show and happen to make a stop, you'll understand what I'm saying. So we sat at the bar and got our orders. I wanted something spicy so I looked out for something that I thought would match my liking on the menu. Found the Cajun chicken pasty which was spicy marinated chicken, ham, bacon, with chipotle sauce. My girlfriend ordered the bangers mash which was mashed potatoes, meatloaf and gravy. My Cajun chicken was amazing. Spiced to perfection as was hoping. My girlfriends bangers mash was ok. Not as much flavor as my Cajun chicken but still pretty good. All in all, I would highly recommend this place. It definitely lives up to the 860 reviews and 4.5 stars, a rare occurrence. Only mishap, which really isn't a mishap, is that if you decide you want to add any custom pieces together in your pasty, we were told you would have to make such request 24hrs in advance. These guys make the sandwiches hours in advance so that it's just put into the oven upon order.

Having traveled in Morocco two years ago, my expectations for an authentic tajine were quite high but I was a bit disappointed by it since it was underwhelming compared to my neighbours' 3Bees Bird and Beasts sharing platter - it was absolutely massive and astounding! The quality of the meat was also superb (my manly friends were kind enough to share a bourbon glazed rib with me, which says a lot, but then again they were so stuffed with the massive platter that by the end they seemed a bit relieved to share with me although they didn't want to let on about that!). On to dessert - I had the chocolate brioche bread pudding with chocolate ice cream and it was really tasty! I ordered well that time round.\n\nTonight I came back with a friend and it was busy and bustling since it was the second day of their new menu and they were offering 50% off food in exchange for feedback - I was more than happy to help!

The richness of the black pudding was complemented perfectly by the sweet and fruity other components of the salad, making it divine.

I had the coriander, chili, and lager braised lamb shoulder which was well done but succulent and cooked to perfection. We also shared the fries that came in a little bag - they were tasty skinny fries that were along the lines of McDonalds' French fries (not a bad thing in this case) but much better. They also came in a rustic paper bag.\n\nFor dessert my friend had the banana, honey and custard mess which she felt was much too sweet. I had the rocky road with marshmallows, shortbread, Turkish delight and chocolate over peanut butter and strawberry jam ice cream. I was a bit put off by the idea of PB&J ice cream (thinking that one or the other would be ok but not together in ice cream although they do work in the classic sandwich of my childhood!) but the enthusiastic server convinced me easily to try it. It was amazing! It was really peanut butter ice cream with a few little swirls of jam, and the rocky road and shortbread was fantastic (although if truth be told the pieces could have been a tad smaller and more bite-sized).\n\nAll in all, it was a fabulous evening!

The normal chips were off limits as they are fried in oil which may be contaminated with other wheat products - that's fine and I appreciated the heads up. But then a glimmer of hope - special handmade, hand cooked chips which came with the steak would be prepared differently and therefore suitable for Coeliac me. And then not. Yes, they were suitable, but they only had enough to cover the steak so no chips for me. Mmmm. It's chips, they are easy to prep and I would wait for them so why not offer this option? Also, by this point it is about 9pm so how many more steaks were they likely to sell on a Wednesday night? I had ordered a salad but the other sides  were not appetising - mash and salad, no thanks. More healthy veggies - nope, it was chips on my mind. \n\nSo, its 3 stars so far - its not a cheap place to grab a post cinema nosh but the bar has been done up well and it's pretty nice. My Greek salad was good - lots of crumbly, salty feta with yummy, perfectly ripe tomatoes and for a 'starter' plate was good value (\u00a34.75) for it's size.

You wouldn't think it now looking at the d\u00e9cor. Inside has an almost nautical theme with sailing pictures on the walls and miscellaneous old fashioned bottles on the shelves. There is a lot of light wood, brass and leather and also a cast iron fire that they sometimes have on in the winter. Whilst there is a separate dining and bar area they also seating available outside, but the road outside is pretty busy so it's not really an appealing option unless you smoke. \n\nThe menu changes daily, but there is a definite swing towards seafood in their food choices. It's quite nice to get such lovely seafood outside of Leith for a change. The variety I've seen in the sauces they serve their mussels with is pretty awe inspiring. A red pesto sauce and mussels? Yum!  The Haddock and chips are also a firm favourite of mine. The light crispy batter on the fish and the chunky chips are superb though slightly pricey for a pub meal at \u00a310. The problem with this being across the road from the cinema is that I've never had dessert here.  The prospect of Ben and Jerrys or popcorn has always stopped me from having some.

It's classic gastro-pub stuff, but done with such care that it still manages to surprise. The pepper squid, for example, isn't your standard frozen pre-cut quid rings - it's done in strips, fresh (I think) and includes the tasty tentacles**. The lamb on a giant Yorkshire pudding - another gastro-pub staple - was also excellent, with an obviously home-made yorkie and tender, flavoursome lamb in a rich gravy.\n\nThe beef pie seems to be The Fountain's standout dish though. The pastry's as good as you'd expect, but the filling (even though I'd been pre-warned) really did knock my socks off. You get a lot of beef, for a start, and I don't think they use a prissy lean steak cut, as some pubs do. The gelatinous, sweet, melting chunks of meat suggest a long, slow cook. The gravy too has a lot going on; spices and fruit, mixed with caramelised onion and marrow-y meat juices. Together, it's a real sensation and you'll want to savour every mouthful.\n\nIn short then, I'll be watching a lot of IMAX films in future, simply for an excuse to shlep across town and have my tea here.\n\n* I was also verbally abused by a van driver on my way over, although I was striding through a thunderstorm dressed like Malibu Ken at the time.

We hadn't booked ahead but we had a drink at the stylish yet cosy bar while a table came free (which was surprisingly quick - less than ten minutes - but we were there at six-ish so quite early).\n\nWhen we ordered, there was only one pork belly left. (Sunday roast sold out by 6 on a Sunday? Really?) My brother opted instead for the shoulder of lamb. Our food arrived fairly quickly and at first it didn't look like there was very much there, but the vegetables joined us later. The pork was amazing - really juicy and tender - and there was a really well-proportioned Yorkshire pudding. Peas and carrots were served separately and to be honest, I thought the bowl they arrived in was just for one person, until another didn't follow and I realised we were sharing. The peas were great and lots of beetroot but the carrot mash was slightly on the cold side. However, everything tasted delicious.\n\nBecause the portions were slightly on the small side, we did decide to have dessert. I say \"because the portions were small\" but who am I kidding? I almost always have dessert regardless... Anyway, we both ordered the cheesecake and we decided to push the boat out and also get a cheeseboard to share. But alas! There was also only one cheesecake left! My brother, ever the gentleman, once again switched his choice, and plumped for the sticky toffee pudding at the waitress's recommendation.\n\nGood gracious. GOOD GRACIOUS. Such a cheesecake shall I dream about in years to come. It was so good I had to give my brother some to try, and so good that I grieved to part with a forkful when I did so. His pudding was also excellent; sticky toffee pudding can so often come out either stodgy and chewy or loose and partly dissolved. This was neither; sticky toffee perfection. But back to my cheesecake... unfff. The base was crumbly and biscuity and full of flavour. The top was sturdy and creamy without being gelatinous. The berries and compote gracing that heavenly cake were round and piquant. This is definitely the best cheesecake I have ever had in a restaurant, and possibly anywhere.\n\nThe cheeseboard was just the right size for two people as a rounding-off course after dessert, with oatcakes and a selection of cheeses including brie, Stilton and cheddar. There was also a small tub of frozen grapes, which I've never encountered before, but which were rather delightful.\n\nFollowing a coffee for him and a lavender rooibos for me, we toddled over to the cinema across the road. \"I think I'm going to need another coffee before the film,\" my brother confided, trailing off to find one. \"Otherwise, sitting in a comfy chair in a warm, dark room can only lead to immediate sleep after a great meal like that.\" A great meal it sure was.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 6, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "When in Ediburgh, I seem to have found myself in Fountainpark all too often, passing by The Fountain thinking 'Oooh!'

I just wasn't overwhelmed, and perhaps that could be because I'd heard *so* much hype.\n\nThe Sheep's Heid Inn is a little out of the way, on the other side of Arthur's Seat in Dudingston. So it was a pleasant 5 minute drive on a gorgeous sunny Sunday afternoon. The boy and I were both pretty pecking (read: starving) and a pub lunch was just what we needed.\n\nThe restaurant is upstairs, but as I had suspected it was busy and there was a waiting list. We added our names to the list and thus waited.\n\nSo it was a little cold in the pub downstairs. Being the oldest pub in Scotland means it is very traditional, and whilst this is charming in a crooked way, it also means there's hardly any windows to let that gorgeous sunshine come streaming in. It was actually warmer outside than in. \n\nWe also had to wait over an hour. Yes, I knew we were on a waiting list but I did ask at first 'how long is the expected wait?' and couldn't get a straight answer. If we'd been told over an hour we may have reconsidered. But instead we got a cryptic 'there are two tables of two ahead of you'. A hungry Jenny does not a happy Jenny make.\n\nBut some nuts, olives and guiness later and we were seated. The menu is quite varied for a traditional Scottish pub, and they have some lovely 'smallish' options, mains, and Scottish options. I changed my mind several times finally going for the sausage and mash (lamb and mint with mustard mash). The boy had the bean stew with chorizo after I suggested it. \n\nAnd damn, I wish I had ordered it. It was absolutely delicious, hearty, spicy, full of veg, and the chorizo wasn't too fatty. My mash was a little dry and the sausages weren't *very* lamby, with no taste of mint. Also there was no veg served with them, just gravy. And I like veg. So I was quite underwhelmed by my main, but loved the other one.\n\nOur starter also never arrived, it was just suddenly our mains. It wasn't listed on the bill either. So whilst I'd like to comment on the antipasto starter, it's a bit of a mystery.\n\nThe chocolate fudge cake was....well, anyone else who was born and bred in Scotland and has had at least one Sunday lunch in a traditional pub and ordered the 'chocolate fudge cake' or 'death by chocolate' as my family called it will know what to expect. Three layers of chocolate sponge, chocolate fudge sauce, heated up. Gooey, chocolately mess. It's not really my thing. I prefer the dainty french patiserries and a combination of flavours, so chocolate on top of chocolate is a bit meh. I have to say, as a cake connosieur, the sponge tasted very floury. But for those who like chocoaltechocolatechocolate I don't think you'll be disappointed. (I wanted the apple flan but was out-voted by my cake-sharing companion.)\n\nSo, overall, it does what it says on the tin. Oldest pub in Scotland, traditional pub grub, and it is *good* pub grub. The fish and chips and steak pie at the table beside us looked amazing. But I suppose as someone who loves a variety of differnet flavours, pub grub shouldn't be top of my list. \n\nIf you go and want to stay healthy, order the bean and chorizo stew.

I've been to the original Brass Monkey in the Old Town a few times, and was expecting something much the same. The Old Town Brass Monkey is a traditional pub, a bit creaky, shared men-and-women toilets, a bit sticky but still nice with friendly staff and kept-up well.\n\nThis Brass Monkey, however, has a style that I like a lot. It still has the dark wood and familiar feeling of a local, but it is just...so...nice. I mean, wow. It is a new bar and it feels new, but not shiney or soulless. There's huge armchairs for big groups, wee high tables, a big bar which meant there were never any awkward crowds or queues, and it really is huge inside so we didn't struggle at all to find a table and sofa combo for our party of 6. You could easily get a party of 12 around the corner tables.\n\nIt's just...nice here. Really. Even the toilets almost took my breath away, for the right reasons. They're absolutely stunning! Can't really describe why, you need to see them for yourself. But very well maintained, beautifully decorated with class and style.\n\nThe style of this place is traditional, but with the finesse of a nicer bar than a 'boozer'. The staff are really friendly and efficient, glasses were cleared but they weren't in our face.\n\nOh and the food, Kerrin R's burger looked too good. They have burgers, pizzas, sandwiches and do breakfasts. Along with a Sunday Hangover movie at midday. Um...yes please. \n\nIf I were closer this would so become my local. In fact, I want it to be my local now. I don't have a local in Edinburgh and this could be it -and it doesn't even do cocktails. Those who know me know what a sacrficie it is to choose a bar that doesn't do cocktails as my local, but the Brass Monkey has persuaded me with its comfy couches, tasty food, nice staff, beautiful surroundings, great pub quiz on a Monday night and all right awesomeness. \n\nNew favourite pub?

Namely:\n\n- Dr Paul pub quiz on a Monday night, 7pm. Awesome. He's a legend, brilliant banter, staff are up for it, but the neighbours upstairs hate it.\n\n- Good pub grub. Not gastropub food, pub grub. The veggie chilli (either as is, or on nachos) is amazing! Chickpeas and beans and nom.

Ask others who know better, but they def have a good range and lots of local stuff too.\n\n- Movies.

The table is laid out for a formal tea.   They offer everything from fresh, out of the oven scones to the traditional tiered plate offerings of finger sandwiches, cheese and fruit.  If you are wanting something more substantial, I would recommend their bread pudding (to die for!) or their beautiful Waldorf salad.  The food is very fresh, prepared well, and presented well.   The selections of tea are vast and they also offer a tea of the day just to keep the variety going.\n\nWhile there, you are offered to \"dress up\" if you so desire.  A darling array of Boas and Hats are offered to guests to use while dinning.  They are great for pictures and make a special event all the more festive.\n\nBesides the ambiance, the food is always of excellent quality.  Fresh, and the best of everything is used.  Please save room for dessert!  You won't want to miss their traditional English offerings.\n\nMy only complaint with the place is that the tables, chairs, and room are small.  There isn't much room to move, and the tables are packed together pretty tight.  If you are any bigger than 5'2\" and 100 lbs, you will be uncomfortable in their chairs.  Very small and not good on the back.  If you are wanting a darling experience with a Tea Room, with excellent food, you won't be disappointed.\n\nDuring the peak season you will want to make reservations.  With a small amount of tables, they fill up fast and are a favorite in the Carefree area.

I am talking about the one and the only royal experience at the English Rose Tea Room in none other than Cave Creek Arizona. \n\nI will just start by saying that the website and pictures don't do this little afternoon tea house any justice. Think of the English Rose Tea Room like the perfect haven for ladies who lunch. The ambiance is fit for a Queen. It's girly, it's cozy and it's adorable, almost like a magical elf's cottage. The woman who runs this tea room is English herself which makes the experience that much more enjoyable. As you walk in, a quaint outdoor patio greets you and once inside, shelves line the walls with every type of tea and tea accessory imaginable. Oh and let's not forget about the Queen herself welcoming you inside (or a cut-out, but we're playing imagination here). Behind the panels lies an intimate tea room where ladies and their guests lunch or have afternoon tea. Hats? Yes there are plenty of hats all around. Did you forget your hat? Well that's ok because there's a basket full ready to be loaned out for the occasion. \n\nMoving on to the tea experience itself, well it's really quite charming. The menu ranges from basic lunch items such as quiche, chicken salad sandwiches and salads to afternoon tea items where you can order the entire Afternoon Tea ($24.99 a person) or you can pick and choose from an a la carte menu. Because my Mom and I had waited so long to try the English Rose Tea Room and we went to celebrate her belated birthday, we ordered a feast fit for a Queen. We first started by sharing the half English salad split for two which was a perfectly fresh salad of greens, raspberries, candied pecans and a delicious raspberry vinaigrette. Following our salad, the Afternoon Tea for two appeared in front of our very eyes! This three-tier meal was accompanied by our choice of tea. We decided to go with the apricot and enjoyed every last sip of not one but two pots! The tea was so delicious you don't need sugar or cream either. The three-tier tea included 6 mini sandwiches a piece (2 cucumber, 2 chicken salad & 2 salmon), two very large (and scrumptious) scones topped w/ powdered sugar and many mini desserts to finish off the meal. My favorite items were the chicken salad tea sandwich, the salmon tea sandwich and the scone. The desserts were decent but the scone really stole the sweet-filled show. \n\nThis is a truly delightful place to spend a lazy afternoon when you have nothing but time.

I have been to high tea at the Phoenician on nearly a yearly basis for about ten years. And I have been a tea connoisseur for much longer. So, you may trust my following opinion: This place is a waste of money and time.\n\nSure, the atmosphere is cute and girly. But that is all you have to enjoy after shelling out $60 for two to high tea! My mother and I drove out from Mesa; so yeah, we traveled over an hour to get there. And we were met at the entrance to an employee chatting on the phone. We waited for a minute or two, but we received not so much as a glance or a nod. We finally tried to seat ourselves when a waitress stopped us and kindly checked our reservation. The kindness ended there. Sure, it was busy, but as the crowd dwindled to only two other groups, our waitress continued to be curt and inattentive. We had to ask for cream! We had to wait over ten minutes before we could grab her attention to refill our tea pots. She agreed but asked for \"just one moment\" and scurried off to help apparently more valuable customers for another ten minutes before taking our tea pots and returning them with almost clear \"tea\" When we asked her to add more tea to our water, she actually had the nerve to disagree with us, claiming that we had ordered \"weak\" teas in the first place. Needless to say, it took another ten minutes before she returned with the improved tea pots.\n\nBut this could be endured as it's never a guarantee that one receives proper customer service. No, the worst is the food!!!! DO NOT GO FOR THE FOOD! We ate three measly, miniscule sandwiches each. It was all bread with a smidge of whatever they put in between the slices. The scones were too many and very, very dry. And the sweets tasted store bought. When I lied and told the waitress that we just loved the sandwiches and could we have some more (we were just plain hungry), she explained that it would be another $10 to our bill! We left hungry after paying $60!!! I have never spent that kind of cash and left hungry. At the Phoenician, they practically have to roll me out, because I'm so full! Terrible service, underwhelming food, and outrageous prices. I will never go again. And I'm sure the waitress doesn't need our business anyway as she failed to say thank you, have a nice day, come again, or even goodbye. She plopped the bill on our desk and walked away. As we left, we heard a party of five discussing their unreasonable bill and how they should tip poorly.

No clear information could be given on the event that was going on nor was I asked if I would prefer to be seated outside. \nI'm pretty sure that TV and High Tea should never be in the same sentence . Alas, amidst all the doilies ,tea pots and glass bells full of FRUIT LOOPS? Was a nice huge flat screen tv. \n\nIts charming but so is DisneyLand . I felt like I was at an amusement park, along with the poor customer service and  pre frozen food and can  someone tell me why I was thirsty at TEA HOUSE.  We I assume its because we were seated against the inside wall behind a table of 8 very loud women enjoying their food under the canopies of campy decorative hats .Perhaps we were simply hidden from our server .... Who seemed to be everyone else's  server .  Not only did our water and tea run dry it remained so until we left . I was unclear as to why there was only one tea provided during high tea, as traditionally three different teas are serve per course . My companion and I ordered different teas and split our pots . We ordered a third a la carte to keep with tradition and it never made it to the table . \n\nNow lets talk about the food . For the love of god do not order the high tea option . Anytime the server says the imported , presume there is not a qualified chef in your company, and more than one menu item has been pre packaged ..  Sandwiches were not fresh the salmon was very strong and they all had the same cream cheese base .  I felt like I was tasting a cheese ball sampler on stale bread.\nThe Scones were huge! And very dry ( which might have been why we ran out of water), more of a gravy biscuit .\nAnd the desserts . Terrible .... Old .... Frozen and just so damn depressing . \nI know from experience when chocolate coating has a chalky coating its old... Or a sticky coating it hasn't been stored properly . The poor tartlets were rock hard and tasted of manteca rather than butter. Their mandarin tops were as dry as the desert and the custard was runny ( like egg yolk runny) there are few foods that I would consider spitting out in a restaurant . This tart was one of them . \nThe strawberries and cupcakes get great raves . Because some local bakery made them the day before and they are fresher than most of what comes out of that kitchen . The rosemary shortbread cookies and what assume were tiny eclairs were half nibbled on as well.\n\nI'm giving it a one star review because its charming and if you have money to blow on your children it's a great place for them because they have not developed their palettes .Or  could careless about customer service.

While hanging out in the parking lot discussing our options, we noticed the sign for Firkin.  Having my handy Yelp knowledge, I knew this place just opened and that they had over 40 beers on tap.  I was easily able to sell my friends on the idea of hanging out there for the rest of the (late) night.\n\nThe space inside of Firkin is quite large with plenty of seating for dinner, as well as a large bar and a lounge area with couches and pool tables.  Everything is new and shiny and there are plenty of TV's to catch a game.  The employees were super friendly and very knowledgeable despite only have been open for a few weeks.  Everyone in our group really enjoyed the atmosphere here.\n\nThey offer specials almost every night of the week, and for this particular night (Friday) they had $3 well drinks and house wine.  Sadly, I didn't get to take advantage of these offers having had too much to drink at the party beforehand.  My friends, however, decided on getting one of the many draft beers available and they were able to sample a couple to see what they liked before putting in their orders.  I'm not sure if it's standard procedure to get samples or if they were being nice to us since we wandered in at one in the morning; either way, my friends were grateful.\n\nFirkin offers a full menu but I didn't have a chance to check it out to see the items or pricing.  They also have a limited late night menu from which I ordered the onion rings, one of the few vegetarian choices I saw.  The onion rings were good but a bit too greasy for me.  For the late night menu, think typical pub fare like fish and chips and lots of appetizers.\n\nMy friends and I were all glad that we made the walk over the parking lot to give Firkin a try.  It was nice to sit down and hang out by the bar to eat and drink and then move the party on over to the lounge area.  Things are a little slow there right now since they are new, in a parking lot with a ton of dead retail space, and their location has a blocked view from Hard Rock.

I normally don't drop names of other establishments in my reviews, but when it comes to beer I take things seriously. That being said, I have mixed feelings about Firkin.  There are definitely a few things I would improve.  Overall though this place is an awesome addition to the Vegas bar scene and I look forward to future visits!  Let's begin, shall we?\n\nBeer first!  With a name like 'Firkin' you would think they would have cask ale (google it!).  Unfortunately, there was no cask ale, although I was told by the bartender and a woman that appeared to be a manger that they were working on getting cask ale.  I am hopeful that Firkin will join the ranks of Todd English Pub and Public House as establishments that serve cask ale (and hopefully they serve it properly).  \n\nThe beer selections are mostly English ales, a few of them being the mediocre Newcastles and Guinnesses of the UK.  The selection of fine US craft beer suffers at the expense of the bar's theme, I suppose.  They did have Firestone Walker Union Jack, Double Jack, and Dogfish Head 60.  I enjoyed an Innis and Gunn Rum Cask ale.  They also have 10 rotating seasonal self serve taps that make things kind of fun!  Watch out though because their beers range from $6-8 a piece, although they do have deals on Newcastles.  Overall, the beer selection is great for Vegas bars, but disappointing compared to the likes of Aces and Ales or Khoury's Fine Wine and Spirits.  I am fine with this considering the crappy beer served in most Vegas pubs, like the Hofbrauhaus across the street.\n\nOn to what I really loved, the food!  I ordered the house French Dip ($11.95).  Not a bad price for a tourist place.  The roast beef was really juicy, the onions grilled perfectly, and with the touch of horse radish on a baguette bun, this was an amazingly delicious french dip!  I tried a bite of my friend's curry, and although a little sweet for my taste it was full of flavor and quite delicious.  Their perfect french fries were lightly battered, yet still light and fluffy.  Very good food at an affordable price makes me a returning customer!\n\nThe atmosphere is nice and social; no slot machines which is a plus in my book.  Lots of TV's.  The staff was very friendly, although somewhat lacking in beer knowledge.  I expect that the staff will be educated as the place evolves.  The promised addition of cask ale is exciting.

The first Monday night of the NFL season meaning a Monday Night Football game.  Local radio station X 107.5 was there.  Beer was only $3.00.  Some food was priced lower for the game also.  I started with just a pint of New Castle.  I came back after hitting the airport.  I then ordered another pint and the fish and chiplets ($5.00 special).  The service was good.  The staff are willing to talk to you and aren't just going through the motions.  I found the experience to be rather enjoyable.  From the service to the good food.  The fries are battered and crispy.  The fish was in the form of nuggets (small pieces).  Battered, fried, hot and crispy.  The tartar sauce was delicious.  I believe it had green onion in it.  A squeez of the grilled lemon and a drizzle of the malt vinegar across the plate made for a dinner worthy of the British beer and atmoshpere that firkin provides.  \n\nSome other points to note are:\n1. The self-serve beer wall with 10 beers to choose from \n2. The game room with billiards, darts, and shuffle board\n3. The large and clean restaurant area\n4.

The burger meat was good.A little on the dry side but not bad  . I give it an ok because the French fries came and saved the day again.I ordered a pound of wings..which sounds a lot right? Well there were only 9 wings. We also ordered the Irish nachos..which is circular\ncuts of french fries with melted cheese on top on a little tiny plate. Super disappointed on that. Don't expect guac, salsa, nothing..I mean why the heck even call them nachos????.The only impressive thing about the menu was the lack of good food.\n\nBeer selection is pretty decent but the size / price relation is a little off.  Also some beers were only bottled and not even the rare ones. Prices were accesible \n\nService... we had to hunt for our server a couple of times. 15 minutes to get our check, refills were slow , however when she was there she was very personable . Not sure if they are understaffed or what .\n\nSo in conclusion if you want the vegas version of a brit pub where everything feels fabricated and fake, then you will enjoy it,Dont get me wrong; It is a nice spot that can def deliver some good times but if you are in the search for good euro food ,service,ambiance  and an awesome variety of beer , then Ill recommend to look around for another place.\n\nMay the soccer, good beer and raging fish and chips  gods be with you\non this search!!", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 2, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "My wife, a friend and I went there for dinner yesterday night.

Of the four dishes, the only ones which was vaguely edible was the salad and the soup. \n\nI ordered the baby spinach salad with bacon, tomato, pine nuts and dried cranberries with balsamic dressing ($8.95). The pine nuts were raw. The tomato was mealy. The bacon was served in ungainly large chunks while the dressing was completely generic.

It tasted like warmed over ketchup with very little complexity and no basil flavouring to speak of. But again - at least edible.\n\nWhat wasn't edible was the two items that required pie crust. Undercooked, it was doughy and completely unappetizing in both the chicken pot pie and the apple cobbler. The chicken pot pie's crust was simply not cooked and soggy. Add the gloppy pie filling consisting of macerated chicken pieces, carrots and celery, it made for an unappealing dish.\n\nIn the apple cobbler, where the pie crust served as a base, the chef had obviously neglected to pre-bake the crust underneath the pie to actual cook the pastry. Throw in the fact that the crumble topping was not even browned, it was an all around fail.\n\nPerhaps  the only redeeming quality of the place was that the servers were pleasant and they tried to do their best despite the loud noise and the obvious kitchen issues.\n\nThankfully, we had a Groupon to use at this culinary wasteland and therefore did not pay full price for the items we were served.

With Americana rock n roll playing overhead and volleyball and basketball playing on the TVs I was having a WTF moment the whole time we dined. Add to that the as always menu you will find anywhere for a \"British\" establishment in Las Vegas. A majority of the menu is Americana grub food, not British. \n\nOkay, so what about the food? I was highly disappointed in both my choices. I got the clam chowder - hardly a chowder, mostly white congealed broth with clams in it. When it arrived at the table it had a sheen on it, like it had been sitting around all day in a big colander in the back. I had to pepper the hell out of it to get flavor. Next - the \"pub dip\" - whatever it is called - it sucks. It is a ciabatta type roll with meandering wads of meat pushed into it served with au jus and a horrid tasting horseradish. I don't know what was wrong with the horseradish, but I'm glad I got it on the side. Why serve this sandwich on a ciabatta roll I must ask, why?! A dip should have nice, squishy, soft bread to soak up the au jus! I was severely disappointed with my meal.\n\nMy friend has the fish and chips, and the \"chips\" were fries. Yes, in case you're wondering, \"chips\" are typically much fatter than the ones they serve at Firkin. She said though that the fish was good, but the batter was a bit heavy.\n\nAnd lastly - my friend ordered a cider drink and received a Boddington's. Of course, I didn't notice this until she offered the half-drunk drink to me because she said she didn't like it. As I took a big swig, expecting cider, I was awash with the taste of British beer... because I have had Boddington's before. And indeed - there on our receipt it even said one pint of Boddington's.

Sadly, we weren't blown away by any of the flavors and most were along the sweet end.  I wish the Parmesan garlic had more of a garlicky taste.  It was all served with their Firkin Dip, which pretty much tasted like Ranch dressing.  The wings were served super hot and there was a generous amount of meat on them, so that's definitely a plus.  Because it's made to order, it's probably best to put your next order in once the first order comes out.  That way you aren't waiting as long in between each round.  We probably wouldn't do the AYCE chicken wings again though.\n\nOn another visit, we both finally ordered off their regular menu.\n\n* The Butler \"An 8 oz USDA Flatiron Steak served with asparagus and with whipped potatoes.\" ($13.95) - The steak was rather under-seasoned, which was apparent by all the Worcheshire sauce I was dumping on it.

Served with Fries, Tangy Tartar Sauce and a Grilled Lemon.\" One Piece $10.95 or Two Pieces $13.95 - The Husband went for the two pieces and what a great choice it was.

Basically you pay for a card of a certain denomination, but you can sample a little bit of each beer they have on tap.  You can take a little or a lot and it just deducts from your card.

Loved the decor throughout, particularly the wood flooring and the magnificent looking bar.  Maybe this is what all bars look like at 3pm and no customers (not a situation I'm used to), but no, seriously, they can't look this good.

The atmosphere was one of the nicest I've ever experienced. The servings were ultra small. They were small for the purpose of being elitist. The fish was overcooked. We returned it and the next one also came out overcooked. This restaurant definitely places form over substance. Too bad, it could easily have been a 5 star restaurant. All they needed to do was stop trying to act so special and actually make the food taste great.

In fact, the politeness of the staff was at such an aristocratic level that combined with the decoration of the restaurant, you can't help but feel as a commoner in middle ages.\n\nAnyways, the food is above decent but not exceptional. The chef is obviously fusion influenced, but not in a relaxed way, i.e. he/she is trying \"too hard\" to mix salty/sweet/sour. Still, the atmosphere, especially dim lighting somehow boosts the quality perception of the food.\n\nBear in mind that I went around 18:00 so the service was just starting so my experience might be unrepresentative.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}], "state": "EDH", "stars": 4.5, "latitude": 55.9353898}]}}
