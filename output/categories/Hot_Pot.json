Yelp don't got Swish? Awww hell nawww...Hehe that's my ghetto supa star!\nOk so Swish is actually the first shabu shabu place in Vegas. I looked when I moved here. This was the only place. I needed something to get my shabu shabu fix taken care of. Shabu Shabu is when you get a hot pot of water or broth and you \"swish your meat/veggies/seafood\" to cook it and eat. I have this thing with interactive food. I love to play with food. \"BE THE BOLOGNA SANDWICH!\" \nSo you come into this strip mall not knowing this place is here. I'm sorry but this place was not easy to find. But yo support yo local businesses. The table setup is kinda cool. It's like a square counter with everyone having their own seperate hot pot. It's a very simple menu. Veggies, meat, kobe, or seafood. You get a healthy size....and a hungry size. They need like Hulk size. But then again this explains so many skinny asians. You can get a variety of apps from Edamame, seaweed salads, miso soup. But the good stuff comes in 2 forms Shabu Shabu form....or Sukiyaki form \nFor dessert - have some Mochi ice cream and rub yer full belly.

There's also sukiyaki, where you cook the meat in a more shallow pot of sauce/broth.  There's not much more to it.  They serve you raw vegetables and meat, and then you basically just cook it yourself in their broth.  It was delicious, but I think it's a bit over-priced for shabu shabu/sukiyaki.  However, I don't see any place like this around Vegas.  The place is small with a U-shaped counter.  I couldn't really talk with our group much.  The decor is clean with just one TV on one side of the room.  Guess where us guys sat.  On the side where you're able to watch the NBA game haha.

Walking into the restaurant, it's pretty straight forward how business is run here.  In front of every seat is a hot pot (or a hot pan) for your own cooking wishes.\n\nThe main two features of Swish is their shabu shabu menu and their sukiyaki menu.  \n\nFor shabu shabu, you get to cook your meat, seafood, or veggies in a broth.  (The menu says it's a seaweed broth, but it appears clear like water and I couldn't taste any seaweed in it.)  I ordered the Prime Rib-Eye Shabu Shabu, Healthy size portion for $13.95.  They give you two dipping sauces, one is a ponzu type sauce and the other tasted like it had a peanut taste in it.  (Supposedly it's sesame though.)  They also give you a small dish of assorted veggies that include onions, carrots, green onions, tofu, mushrooms, spinach, and cabbage.  A small portion of two types of noodles and a bowl of rice are included with your shabu shabu order.  You can also request for shichimi (chili powder), layu (hot sesame oil), and chili paste for an additional kick.  It's a filling portion for the price you pay, and you can order additional rice or noodle for no extra charge.  (Double check on the noodle part though.)  They also offer a Kobe Classic, a Seafood Combo, a Mushroom Party, and a Vegetarian Delight.  You can also everything a la carte to your existing order of shabu shabu.\n\nThe BF ordered the Prime Rib-Eye Sukiyaki, Healthy Portion for $14.95.  They pour a bit of oil into your hot pan, and add a sauce where you pretty much grill your food into the sauce.  Throughout your meal, you'll add more grilling sauce to help cook your meal.  There's a bit more taste with the sukiyaki style, but shabu shabu would be considered healthier.  You also get the assorted vegetables, noodles, and bowl of rice with your sukiyaki order.  Be sure to ask for your raw egg too, you can either dip your food into it or pour it over your rice like the BF does.  They also offer a Kobe Classic, a Seafood Combo, a Chicken Fiesta, a Mushroom Party, and a Vegetarian Delight.  You can also everything a la carte to your existing order of sukiyaki.\n\nOther items on the menu include appetizers like kimchee, spinach sesame salad, seaweed salad, and spicy seafood salad.  For dessert, you can find ice cream, mochi, and Japanese steamed cheesecake.  A few bento options are available to go too!\n\nService was good, but I heard it could be better.  In the beginning of your cooking, they offer garlic, radish, and green onions to your sauce or cooking pan.  The BF mentioned that when he eats there, the waitresses often cook the food for them.  However, when we went, they didn't offer.  He wasn't sure if it was because he goes at lunch or because he's with other guys.  =)  Haha!\n\nOverall, my experience at Swish was good.  At other shabu shabu places (like Koji's Japan in Orange, CA http://www.yelp.com/biz/cqQHvz1zvM_z2MbH0zjXBA#hrid:xzHUpQinpow0nRqocXAB0w/query:Koji),  they offer unlimited vegetables and a better dipping sauce.  Then again, Koji's is a bigger run operation than Swish.  I wish they would offer more vegetables though in their order.  \n\nLook out for their specials!  When we went, they offered 25% off Kobe orders, 10% off with Student IDs, and a frequent eater card.  They're about to open another location on Silverado Range and Maryland Pkwy in the late fall.\n\nOverall: 3.5 stars, but I'll round up.\n\nUpdate! 10/29/07 - Over the weekend, the BF and I were craving some Swish.  I ordered the Kobe Rib Eye Shabu Shabu, Healthy size ($35.95) and the BF order the Kobe Rib Eye Sukiyaki, Healthy size ($38.95).  The meat was so tender and oh so good.  I think the prices just went up and they no longer offer a frequent eater card.  But they do offer a group discount for five or more.  And reservations are accepted for parties of three or more too.  Only udon noodles were given to us this time, and the veggies are still on the skimpy side in my opinion.  The Kobe Rib Eye is pretty good stuff, but it's a costly thing!\n\n(I added some pics of our dinner on the business profile section.)\n\nUpdate!

They serve you the raw ingredients and you just cook it yourself shabu shabu style (in a boiling broth, like fondue) or sukiyaki (pan-fried) on your own personal burner. \n\nBut for the same reason, it seems the place is a tad over-priced. I mean ... you cook it your self. \n\nPrices on entrees range from $9 for the small veggie shabu shabu plate to $60 for the large Kobe sukiyaki plate. \n\nI think with the exception of the bento, they don't cook anything. All of the kitchen labor is just prep work (like washing veggies, cutting meat). I'm gonna assume the seafood is shipped in frozen. The cheesecakes and mochi ice cream are probably outsourced. They don't have to keep a large variety of ingredients on hand. \n\nYou can ask someone to help you if you're totally clueless. Sometimes they offer to get you started. It seems the burners frequently go out or the wait staff forgets to light them. Don't be shy to let some one know. The wait staff is always attentive and polite. \n\nThe items always seem to be fresh. I get the seafood or mushroom party (variety of fungus) or vegetable plate add on to my bf's Kobe. The Kobe is sliced per order. I like it when meats are cut or decanted right before eating it. It keeps the texture crisp. \n\nI'm pretty particular on the temperature to which my seafood is cooked. Like I like my shrimp well done, but I like my salmon and scallops rare. One of the advantages to cooking all your own stuff. \n\nThey recently expanded their menu to include bento. \n\nTry the steamed cheesecake. Its Japanese-style, so its fluffier, lighter. \n\nSwish is a good alternative to the common dining experience. Each meal is nicely balanced with meats (or meat sub), veggies (cabbage, carrots, onions, mushrooms, green onions, and spinach), and starches (rice and udon). Meals also come with two dipping sauces: a peanut sauce and ponzu. You can order a small or large portion meal. \n\nI think I liked this place a lot the very first time because it was novel.

Hey, I'm not complaining. More premium meat (thats what she said?)\n\nThe vegetables were plentiful and flavorful. The establishment was clean. But the best part? I was able to get my fix of 90s pop music! Granted it was all boy band music, but it was hilarious because it took me back to the days of late high school early college.  Pretty hilarious stuff.\n\nAll in all, Swish lived up the hype by my fellow Yelpers. \n\nNext time, I want to try the Mushroom Party (literally, a mix of 5 different kinds of mushrooms).

I believe the girl on shift that day was inexperienced. She was on her own and we had to keep asking her over and over again for the same items.

They weren't provided until close to the end... \n\n4) I would say most shabu shabu places, if not all, that I've been to had the built-in shabu pots. Here, they use the portable gas ranges, which I don't think provides the same kind of experience.

My boyfriend and I were hungry, so we each opted for the bigger/hungry size portions (8 oz. meat, roughly 15 slices).  For those of you not too hungry, you may want to try the smaller/healthy size portion (6 oz. of meat, roughly 10 slices).  You also get a variety of sides, along with white rice.   \n\nUnlike Shabu Shabu Paradise, the burner isn't built into the table, but is a portable unit where you get a bowl and some vegetables/tofu/noodles (sides) to cook.  The type of broth, though, is where the cooking differs.  For those of you that prefer less seasoning/plain eating, choose Shabu Shabu.  If you like Soy Sauce, though, definitely go for the Sukiyaki.  I opted for the Shabu Shabu, since I tend to like my food more on the plain side (sensitive stomach).\n\nAlso, they do give you more seasoning options, such as dipping sauces--peanut-based and ponzu, as well as other ingredients (garlic, scallions, chili sauce) to make an altogether different sauce.\n\nRemember, if you get hungry, you can get refills of the veggies/tofu/noodles without paying extra, but will have to shell out more money otherwise.    \n\nI was so hungry/focused on the meats that I almost forgot about the veggies/noodles/tofu.

This was actually my first time ever having Sukiyaki, so I don't have much to base it off of, but I still found it to be pretty damn delicious. My boyfriend actually enjoyed the Sukiyaki more than the Shabu Shabu because it was just so flavorful, although a lot less healthy than the Shabu.

I love me some nappa, but I'd prefer a little more broccoli and udon noodles (OMG, the udon noodles are SO GOOD).  Maybe next time, I'll just order and extra portion of tofu and noodles??  \n\nThe point is, there will definitely be a next time.  I can't believe I haven't tried this before!\n\nI found my friend's seaweed broth to be a little bland, but they have nice containers of chopped garlic, onion, green onion, and chili sauce that you could use to flavor it up, if you're a DIY sort of broth maker.\n\nThe service was great, the ambiance was nice, I even enjoyed a little sake, which I don't usually care for.  They served our large group (10 ppl) as well as a full restaurant with grace and aplomb.  \n\nPart of our group ordered sushi and apparently, the \"spicy\" ones should say \"THESE ARE ****ING CRAZY MAD SPICY.\"  So, if you're into heat, they can bring it.\n\nSo, who wants to go get some Shabu with me?

My boyfriend was like, \"We're going to share.\" I started to wonder if the portions were supposed to be for each person. If so, then I felt like everything was overpriced. When we got the food, we were able to share it just fine (though my boyfriend ate most of it and I am hungry now, a few hours later). At the end of the meal, I still felt like we overpaid. Our meal was $23. If we hadn't split what the waitress implied was supposed to be a meal for a single person, then it would've been too much, imo. We just had hot pot at this great place in Rowland Heights, CA (called Kingswood Teppan Steak House, if you're ever in the area) and we had way more food and broth (two kinds, too) for $32. We had two different kinds of broth, four ingredients (chicken, beef, mushrooms, vegetables), and there was fried rice for each of us. Since it seems we split a single meal, we only got one bowl of white rice. The $9 difference would've only gotten us... I think probably just the side of chicken (it was like $6.95 or something) and we would have a couple bucks leftover that wouldn't have paid for anything else.

I dip my meat, watch the color change, dip the sauce, and consume.  Tasty and healthy; but pretty average shabu if you ask me.

As a matter of fact there are even some characteristics of Swish which I prefer to Paradise:  options and price.\n\nI love the variety of options at Swish from the fact that you can venture off of Shabu Shabu altogether if you desire, or that even if you choose Shabu Shabu as your option (as I always have and probably always will) that you can choose a larger variety of protein options (salmon!) and different types of broth (spicy miso!).   I also love their tableside condiment tray options with garlic, chili paste, green onions and radish all being available at your disposal.  Please don't judge me by how much Garlic and Chili Paste I put in my broth, it's a free country.   Service is friendly and usually efficient, though they do sometimes get overwhelmed.   When paying by credit card the last few times the waitress would bring over one of those smartphone enabled scanners to swipe the card and then have us sign the touchpad.  Not a fan of this as it seems like they're hovering over you waiting to see how much you tip.   Fortunately for all involved, I'm an amazing tipper so it just made us all feel better.  \n\nThe cons to Swish when compared to SSP would be the quality of the food is slightly lower (though still a good deal considering SSP is more expensive), and it definitely skews younger and louder as far as clientele. That could be a pro to a lot of people, but I'm the type of guy who pays extra to sit in VIP sections if available for any concert I go to because I can't stand being mixed into a crowd or standing for more than 5 minutes at a time.
