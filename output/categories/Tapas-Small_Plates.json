I hope the original appetizer, which normally costs $23, comes in a larger portion than what i got bc my dish came with five little raviolis.  However, I have to say that they were damn good.  My friend had the Truffled Onion Soup, which was nicely presented.  It had a creamy texture to it (but not too rich); our only complaint was that it came lukewarm.  For our main dish, I had the Braised Beef Short Ribs, which came boneless and packed into a rectanglular shape.  Though it looked somewhat small, it was actually very filling as the meat was densely packed together.  It came with crunchy shredded leeks on top and cooked leeks on the bottom - delicious!  My friend had the Alaskan King Salmon, which was only slightly cooked, so it was nearly raw.  I wasn't a fan of the dish, but my friend enjoyed it.  I thought the portions were good as it came with two sizeable pieces of fish.  My third friend ended up ordering a $60 steak (rib eye), which was mouthwatering good, even without ketchup.  It came with a little metal pot of one of the best creamy mashed potatoes I've had in a restaurant.  For dessert, there was only one item listed, which was the Chocolate Tasting.

My Fleur De Lys review that was far far too long to fit in yelp.\n\nIt's 5.45am. About to land face down on the deck.. but these thoughts should go here before they leave to nowhere.\n\nMy first thought is the music, and I am simply waxing here. I DJ, and I live in SF. A tight knit community, sometimes you hear some of your friend's tracks here and there, but I am always astonished to hear Lorin out and about. He is such a mild mannered, thoughtful, fun guy.... And so normal. So when I am at Post Ranch and he comes on Muzak, or I am at a restaurant like Fleur... I sort of have to sit on my hands and bite my lip because I FREAK out. I love hearing Bassnectar.... Love it. And to hear it randomly like that always gives me the oozing joy that our community has been worthwhile and pervasive.\n\nHowever, the track was an outro downtempo sparkly mellow glitch thing, and it was in conjunction with a number of other ambient/downtempo tracks. I have a residency where I DJ downtempo, and note I have moved from it in the last years to traditional funk, soul breaks, and even afrobeat and hip hop... because somewhere along the line this new and cutting edge filter of music turned into the new elevator sound.... Inoffensive, non tactile sounds of wallpaper and background noise. It is sad to me that some innovative and interesting sounds of a decade ago now seem like the new Yanni or wavy jazz like Kenny G. Electronic music is simply a filter of other genres, so I guess we are filtering AM gold and 103.7 KKSF through electronica now.\n\nSo downtempo producers.... Get on it. It's boring now. Like the review... moving on.\n\nThis is not a small ticket meal, nor is this an every month (let alone two fiscal quarters) event. A gentle blog about this sort of experience hardly does it justice, as well as does not help to dampen the sticker shock.\n\nI have heard this about the SF location... that the price is simply outrageous, and however good the food is, it cannot be justified. I would completely agree, and do.... But we found the chefs tasting menu at $94 for 6 courses to be friendly, albeit that included amuse bouche and petit fours.\n\nYou will be paying nearly $200 a head. I have said time and time again... if you walk out of a meal concerned in *any* way about the bill, there is something wrong with the event overall. This teetered precariously on the brink of this sort of experience.... The cost had me slipping off the cliff with one foot's panicked shuffling grasping onto the crumbling hillside. My lovely date, however, always seems to calm my fumbling at the brink. So it is that I walk out of this meal as satisfied as I have been in years, with a $9 Double Espresso stuck in my craw, and an uninspired cheese plate. Other than that..... a phenomenal experience.\n\nThe space was fantastic. 60 foot ceilings with surprisingly well conceived lighting, and elegant drapes floor to ceiling that could easily be negotiated and altered to open or close spaces. There is a private banquet/booth area that seems very cozy, and was assumedly for people like us that prefer not to be seen due to the problem this causes... when people see us it turns into a zoo and photos and all that. It is embarrassing, and normal people don't want their experience altered simply because people like us are there (this is a joke people). Honestly, they must be reserved for the fame and glorious, because the bride and groom that were sat by the door had a less romantic table than us, so they must be something special. If you reserve, ask for it because it would be a phenomenal private and sexy affair. The only thing we noted at the end of the meal is how frustrating it is, and has been for me in the past, designing around the bulky, ugly coding requirements. The bleating red exit sign  1/2 way up the wall was aesthetically nightmarish, yet sadly required.\n\nSpeaking of coding:\n\nFrom a hotel design perspective, something did bother me, and this is more for the management than the reader.... Subtle difficulties arise when trying to pair the experience with a slight lack of awareness... such as the two completely different handles on the bathroom door. Both are relevant to fire code sure, but you have two doors less than a couple feet apart (both in the same field of vision); one with a Toledo style handle that is a  1/2\", one with a grenada style at 1\". This is silly stuff so that fire hoses don't get caught, and frankly in this area I would be surprised if coding suggested you needed  1/2'. Whatever the case... MAKE IT CONSISTENT.

Your attention to detail has to be that much more intense In this case, it wasn't. Having helped to design and build hotels, maybe it was just me.\n\nService is... slightly green. You could tell these employees had been trained in fine dining tableside service style, however were just as interested in becoming buddies and being quite real. This made for a better experience in my mind, because the service was consummate while any slight errors were made up for by a friendly, earnest staff. However, you could note inconsistencies between tables as they would shoot us a smile in regards to an awkward experience with guests at another table. As much as I like being the in table, it does mark for inconsistency. However, they worked incredibly well together, and we always felt attended to, without being doted on. Another aspect of service I really enjoyed was the backwaiting and support each server got. We never were quite sure who are main server was, and it absolutely did not matter.\n\nOur sommelier was hiding a slight Wyoming country drawl with knowledgeable and deft knowledge on the wine list. Opting not to go for the $45,000 dollar bottle, we told her generally what we wanted, at what price range (I suggested that was garish to say, and she said it is impossible to help you without knowing the price... she was a very *real* and enthusiastic wine lover, as compared to a contemptuous wine snob. In the end, she said she was frustrated when people did not offer a range because it is so ambiguous and vague without it). We got a very nice white zin. Haha... no no. A young and sassy Bordeaux. It was a fine and appropriate companion for dinner, but nothing that lingered on the palette.\n\nThe pastry chef seemed to be an experimenter. The petit four were interesting, such as the pear marshmallow, but I didn't feel the bread service was refined... too many choices without any one stand out loaf. The pretzel roll seemed to be a coney island novelty, and I suggest it is whisked away from the menu. It didn't fit.\n\nOur courses were fantastic, and somehow Lauren was able to beat me with her selections each time.\n\nI got the ahi tartare, eponymous starter, so often boring. It was a fantastic take on it, the ahi fresh and flavor incredibly subtle, helped along by a chiffonade or micro julienne of cucumbers. The flavours were so FRESH... incredibly subtle, but coalesced perfectly. Very balanced, and really a stunning reimagining of this boring dish I am nearly hanging up on. If this hadn't been interesting or a new take, I am quite sure I would have been done with Ahi poke style apps for a long time coming. I am already there, had low expectations, and was very pleased.\n\nLauren's sweet onion soup (with duck ragout and black truffle) was, perhaps, one of the best onion soup creations that I have ever had. The sweetness, earth, and floral aspects (read: the good parts) of the Onion lingered on your palette, while the bitter or astringent aspects melted away.\n\nThe second course was phenomenal, and I admit mine might have beat hers out this round, but her overall meal won the match.  She had scallops, which I thought were a bit overcooked.  I had an INCREDIBLE potato veal ravioli dish.... melted in my mouth.\n\n3rd course I had the duck, while Lauren had the filet mignon. The portion sizes for this entr\u00e9e were incredibly inconsistent... with the filet looking like a mountain of meat, while the duck was minimal and sparse. The presentation of the entire meal was stunning, from china patterns to the way the chefs blended the food onto the plate out of the patterns. It was incredibly well done, and an interesting style of presentation that was playful, symmetrical, and gorgeous. It never ceased in pleasing us, and making us giggle with a little loving, excited hand squeeze. The duck was a little dry, but fine. I am, however, not sure if I have seen a more perfectly cooked filet. It was incredible.\n\nDessert involved an upcharge off the prix fixe with a cheese plate, as well as a chocolate souffl\u00e9 with chocolate sauce. The cheese plate I touched on somewhere back in the reams of electronic paper that is this review.... It was uninspired. It might have been that I was very full, but I hardly touched it. I sampled them all, and they were complex and quite good... but generally not as interesting or thoughtful as I hoped.\n\nThe problem there is that I *wasn't* hungry, but I was quite capable of throwing back the souffl\u00e9 in lieu of that. So I would assume that is either a comment on the cheese plate, or more likely a comment on the souffl\u00e9.\n\nAs for the souffl\u00e9?\n\ncontinued next week!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 2, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "As for the souffl\u00e9?\n\nI know it is just a souffl\u00e9. It is simple, and if you haven't tried making one in your own kitchen spend a Sunday afternoon having fun and experimenting. It is a blast, not too hard, and you can do ANYTHING with souffl\u00e9s. A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G. Trust me... it is a good time! Go experiment! I made a breakfast cheese and bacon one once. Seriously.... They are easy and can go in every direction.\n\nHowever this was without question one of the finest souffl\u00e9s I have ever had. Sometimes the chocolate is so perversely sweet it feels like hershey's, and other times so flavourless it feels like the baker forgot sugar. This was so well balanced, and after a meal like we had, not overtly rich. The sauce brought out enough of the chocolate flavor that the souffl\u00e9 itself was able to stand alone as a delicious cocoa confection. It also had risen to perfection, and was timed incredibly well. Like... perfectly.\n\nOf course it was at this point the hand press decaf for my lady came out, and my simple double shot of espresso followed..... at $9. I have a contention about that.... The coffee is to buffer the night ahead from this rich and gluttonous meal we had just consumed. It is more of a courtesy to a well rounded dining experience than a necessary or expected aspect of dining. What I am saying is that this should exist for the guest like a well priced wine list, or should be a complimentary aspect of the evening. I don't mind a fair charge for a coffee at the end of the meal, but when you are dropping $400 I am not quite sure a $9 espresso feels fair or gracious. It was actually disappointing that something that petty got us talking about the price of the meal, etc.... and as we walked out of the door it was a simple espresso at the end of the meal that rang in our heads and caused consternation, instead of the entire majestic and astonishing experience that preceded that.\n\nAnd it is with consternation that I give the entire experience 4 stars.  Simply, I feel it is 3.  Just fine.  But the dining experience is unreal, the food is divine.

Why would a kitchen start dinner with fried fish? My a priori quibble disappeared quicker than a Bernie Madoff investment. Eating vinegarish potatoes after the tempura removed its cloying oil. \n\nFirst course: Truffled onion soup - black truffle crepe filled with braised duck, julienned black truffles, and red wine onion puree. Rarely can an ingredient subdue an onion's harshness. Well, I found one such rarity: black truffles. Unlike Aliz\u00e9, which combined truffle oil with Lilliputian bits, Fleur de Lys used comparatively Brobdingnagian stripes.\n\nSecond course: Braised veal and potato ravioli, pea foam, veal jus, and mixed vegetables. Whoever reared this calf should know that their care did not go unnoticed. \n\nThird Course: Guinea hen, green and white asparagus risotto, parmesan foam. Crispy-skinned medallions married harmoniously with the al dente risotto. \n\nFourth Course: Butter poached Maine lobster, paprika cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, spaetzle, sauerkraut, chanterelles. In a vein similar to Aliz\u00e9's crab and horseradish amalgamation, the paprika cr\u00e8me fraiche poured over the lobster left a pleasant warmth after the lobster's initial sweetness. \n\nFifth Course: Venison loin, red cabbage, huckleberries, pomme pur\u00e9e. Lean and strongly flavored, the pan-seared venison valiantly challenged the beef loin. I am still in disbelief that such perfect doneness could be achieved without an immersion circulator. Regarding the pomme pure\u00e9, it may be more veracious to rename the accoutrement butter with a touch of potato. For those who bake, the potatoes mirrored a stiff peak.\n\nSixth course: Beef Tenderloin, seared foie gras, black truffles, spinach, and wild mushrooms\n\nSeventh course: Spiced pumpkin souffl\u00e9 and cinnamon ice cream.  The mastodonic ramekin brimmed with delicate crust and a moist interior.\n\nThe petite fours were delicious, especially the carrot cake.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Great experience!\nIf you have the money to spend here, go for it!

Concentrated droplets of grapefruit and cranberry woke up the palate, and the sweet beet tamed the tartness.\n\nFirst course: Ahi tuna tartare, fennel salad, ginger ponzu, sesame seed tuile. Starting with the tuna and continuing through the remaining savory courses, Fleur de Lys' breads became sine qua nons, specifically the rosemary-caramelized onion foccacia and the pretzel roll. The lime and vinegar sauce threatened to overpower the dish, but anise and sesame evened out the flavors, ensuring that the tuna's freshness remained the focal interest.\n\nSecond course: Veal and Yukon Gold potato ravioli, braised carrots, pea foam. It is a given that veal ravioli, kampachi, and duck are delish. The vegetables, alas, tend to get overlooked at one's peril. Cut carrots into canoe shapes, coat them in veal stock, and you can get anyone to nosh on them ad infinitum.\n\nThird course: Foie gras, raspberry, strawberry, blackberry, Cabernet sauvignon reduction, and brioche. Ok, so maybe I will have to expiate for my two-day foie gras binge, but it is so bloody delicious. Add two butyraceous pieces of brioche and you have a winning - and Lipitor-inducing - combination.\n\nFourth course: Olive oil poached kampachi, pickled shitakes, tempura scallions, ginger foam. Poaching the kampachi lent a velvety texture. The pickled mushrooms and ginger were piquant. Tempura-coated scallions furtively blended into the ginger foam, detected only by their mountainous batter and the imbricating parlsey.\n\nFifth course: Duck breast, duck confit, chestnut pur\u00e9e, cipollini onion, duck cracklings, baby bok choy. The bok choy's size relative to the duck is a testament to Keller's reverence for vegetables. In general, an ancillary viand should not detract from the main ingredient. In this case, the bitter crucifer confidently towered over the supine, webbed-footed waddler. The cipollini onion topped with cracklings ought to be available to order by the half-dozen.\n\nIntermezzo: Coconut tapioca soup, kiwi, tempura plantain, strawberry, passion fruit-coconut sorbet. If there is anything I would deem posh boba, this would definitely qualify.\n\nSixth course: Cappuccino with Bailey's ice cream and a chocolate-banana liquor fondant. I reluctantly passed up the coffee service for fear that caffeine at 8:30 would keep me up too late, yet I could not resist quaffing the iced cappuccino.

Tuna Tartare & Filet - I'd say I've had similar dishes elsewhere. \n\nFor dessert, we had the chocolate souffle with chocolate ganache. OMG - it's to die for! Unlike a lava cake - it isn't rich/decadent. It's like chocolate sponge cake - light and fluffy & when topped with the ganache it's the perfect combo. I would go back and get the chocolate souffle any day. Also, I got coffee to end the meal & it's served with it's very own single served french press :-) Coffee was great! \n\nLast but not least, the service was impeccable.

I've been all over alaska, I've eaten my share of salmon sashimi all over the US, but this salmon was so freaking awesome. It was a beautiful wild salmon \"barely cooked\" and then plated with an apple sauce and a beautiul fresh herb green sauce. The salmon is cooked at 200 degrees for a little while to make it warm, but it maintains a beautiful, delicate texture more like sashimi. It was silky, NOT flaky. Portion size was generous.

Just the perfect amount of ponzu (with some ginger I think) with fennel. what flavor!\nAlaskan Salmon: Cooked nicely.  It was tasty... maybe a little too many chives.  Kind of overpowered the dish.\nBraised Short Ribs: Cooked to perfection.  The short ribs didn't even need to be cut with a knife.  The guiness reduction was a nice touch.  Didn't care too much for the mustard with mustard seeds.\nFilet Mignon: Perfectly cooked to my liking (medium rare).  A beautiful piece of meat here.  The wine reduction sauce was spot on.  The mash potatoes were a little too buttery and creamy.  Almost didn't taste like potatoes.\nComplimentary Dessert: Passion fruit sorbet with coconut tapioca + fruits.  WOW.

Hubert Keller is one of my favorite chefs, so ever since I first heard about him a couple years ago, I told myself next time I was in either Las Vegas or San Francisco, I HAD to go to Fleur de Lys.\n\nIt happened to be restaurant week in Las Vegas so our group had come here getting that menu in mind.  However that didn't last very long.\n\nOur reservation was for 8:30, but a table where they were planning on seating us was taking their sweet ol' time and we were forced to wait.  After about 10-15 minutes of waiting outside, the hostess finally came up to us and offered us to wait in their lounge and enjoy complimentary champagne in their LOWLY lit lounge to apologize for the longer wait.  Free champagne?  Yes please!  The hostess was also kind enough to keep us updated on the table, waiting maybe an additional 10 or so minutes.\n\nThe lighting in the dining room was a little better and was thinking I could get away taking pictures without using my external flash on my camera (I hate using flash in a fine dining restaurant as I feel its a little bit of a distraction and nuisance).  Our table was slightly tucked away off in the corner, making out meal semi private.  Within a New York minute, our server, Marcus, was at our side, giving us our menus.  So like I said, we had come having in mind that we were going to get the restaurant week menu for $50.  However, right when we opened the menu, right there staring us down was Chef Keller's \"Elegance Menu\", which was 4 courses (instead of 3 on the RW menu) for $89.  Yes, a little hard to justify an extra course for $39, but, while some were the same, had more and better choices.  Such \"better\" choices included veal and potato ravioli and filet mignon.  The RW menu did not have the ravioli or the filet.\n\nI started with the ahi tuna tartare with shaved fennel salad, a ginger ponzu sauce, and fennel seed tuile.  The tuna was very fresh and the ponzu wasn't too overpowering or salty.\n\nMy next course I ordered the veal and Yukon gold potato ravioli with English peas, veal jus, pea shoots, and a sunchoke foam.  The ravioli were pretty good but I do have to say the veal jus was a little salty.  I still very much enjoyed this dish.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the prime filet mignon, with a potato puree, baby spinach, wild mushrooms, salsify, and a red wine reduction.  Medium rare of course.  The meat was cooked perfectly, though slightly underseasoned. The vegetables were perfect and the potato puree was very buttery.  There was an option to add black truffles and foie gras to the filet for an additional $25, and while I didn't partake in that, 2 others did.  The size of the foie was as round as the filet and they put A LOT of truffles.  I'm not talking about like maybe 3 or maybe 5 slices of black truffles.  It was a PILE of truffles, I'm guessing at least a dozen slices.  That right there, at $75/oz, definitely worth the $25.  And while seeing that much foie and truffles made me sad I didn't get it, they both gave me some of theirs so it was like I had gotten it myself.  Oh man... the foie was just... I had to take a moment.  I also said I didn't want to eat or drink anything else after having the foie for fear of washing away the flavor.  It was ethereal.\n\nAs much as I wanted to savor the foie gras, our dessert courses came out.  With souffle on the menu, I knew at least 3 or 4 people in our party would order it, so instead of ordering one for myself, I decided I would just steal a couple of bites of theirs and order the other item: a banana chocolate lava cake, served with a shot of peanut butter milkshake and Baileys ice cream.  The lava cake was really good and had a pleasantly subtle banana flavor.  The peanut butter milkshake was good.  I honestly didn't really get the Baileys ice cream.  Personally to me it just seemed to be a little bit of a disconnect.  I mean, if the pastry chef would kindly explain why he chose Baileys ice cream, then I'd probably understand.

Three of us were actually tempted to lick the bowl, but we knew better...\n\n-Chimichurri flank steak with mini baked potatoes: flank steak is not my favorite cut of beef by any means, but it was cooked well and pre-cut. The chimichurri added a burst of freshness and lightness to the dish. The crispy mini baked potatoes were topped with creme fraiche and perfectly cooked. \n\n-Trio of Desserts--Molten Chocolate banana cake, peanut butter shake, Bailey's ice cream: I was a little worried about the banana component in the cake because I'm not a fan of that combination, but the cake was outstanding. Moist cake and warm, rich dark chocolate sauce oozing out of the middle with a hint of banana flavor? What's not to love? The peanut butter shake was very pronounced in flavor and a cute concept. The Bailey's ice cream made a great complement to the cake. I thought all three were fantastic, with the cake and ice cream combo being my favorite.\n\n-Petite Fours: after the meal,  we were treated to a selection of petite fours including: passion fruit gelee, coconut marshmallow, French canele, pina colada French macaroon.

Chef Kellar's food is so clean and so nicely presented.  Second course was roasted organic beets, goat cheese, poached quail egg and house cured duck.  The dish was so pretty, a portrait.  Entree was the Slow Poached Butter Maine Lobster, Herb spaetzle, wild mushrooms, Alsatian choucroute, paprika foam - sooooooo great.  One of the best lobster dishes I have ever had in a restaurant.  Finally the dessert was a valhrona warm chocolate cake, peanut butter shake and housemade ice cream - yummy....  \n\nOn our way out we caught a glimpse of the master - Hubert Kellar.

The choosing of the restaurant came together after my fine dining foodie friend told me that we should try it.  This was the second signature restaurant of Hubert Keller; probably the most noted French chef in America and a James Beard award winner... so we were expecting a lot to say the least.  \n\nWe come to the restaurant inside the Mandalay Bay with our reservations already set, and are seated promptly with a table nearing the 12,000-bottle wine loft.  This was probably the most cellars inside a restaurant that I have seen at the time.  The main dining room has 30-foot ceilings with stone covered walls and embossed wood ceilings.  This was going to be a long and memorable birthday dining experience.  \n\nI ordered the Roasted Organic Beets: fresh goat cheese, poached quail egg, house cured duck from the appetizers.  \n\nAnd the Pan Seared Duck Breast: duck confit, chestnut puree, cippolini onion, ginger gastrque. At this point, I didn't know half of what I was ordering and my foodie friend didn't really know either.  And the full menu didn't have any prices on any of the items we were ordering, but we knew to expect somewhere around $80-100 per person.   \n\nSo apparently my dinner was going to be four courses.  Our other friend who was not really a foodie smugly ordered an 18 OZ Bone in Prime Rib Eye Steak: Creamed Spinach, Marble Potatoes, Red Wine and Shallot Reduction.  \n\nMy fine dining foodie friend had decided to order the same items as myself.  The Fleur also offers a \"prix fixe\" menu for a reasonable $55, but only offers a choice of two appetizers and two main courses, and a dessert.  You also have the choice of trying Chef Keller's signature tasting menu ($140) and wine pairing ($80).  \n\nAll I can really say about the food served was that it seemed barely warm and ridiculously small.  Most of the food served here is tiny and doesn't have the richness or depth to constitute any major delicious flavors.  My foodie friend was actually disappointed enough about the main course that he had the audacity to tell the server that we food was not up to par.  I could have easily given the food itself 3 stars, not the epic 5 star 200th review I was looking to have.  \n\nAnd it was at that point that I did realize I may have been better off ordering from the Kobe Beef & Prime steaks menu. Fine dining can be quite the double-edged sword for that fact that you are spending so much money on so little food that is showcasing mainly culinary skill and technique.  But what it all really boils down to is pretentious food and overzealous expectation.  Even if the food tastes great, that moment only lasts for a few seconds on each bite.  The food here is so miniscule that you could eat one plate in 4-5 bites.  \n\nHowever at the end of our dinner the sommelier came out and poured us some complimentary dessert wine which was pleasing surprise.  He had wished all of us happy birthday and told us to enjoy the rest of our stay in Vegas.

I cannot stand cooked fish and thankfully, did Not need to taste the Salmon (yuck).  Our very attentive (and funny) server was Javier and he \"upgraded\" our 6 course meal to 8 courses, complete with 2 desserts and petit fours (which were more like petit tens)\n\nSummary:\n- Amuse Bouche: Mine was a piece of sweet beet on a tower of goat cheese which was flavorful. Everyone else got a small piece of tempura fish (eeeks)\n\n- Ahi Poke: Having lived in Hawaii for more than 10 years, i'm really quite an ahi snob. This dish was ok; the ponzu might have been a little  overpowering. \n\n- Truffled Duck Soup: YUM. They were very generous with the truffle; the tiny little piece of duck was delicious and the piece of truffle it was sitting on was pretty amazing too\n\n- Veal Ravioli: Very delicious. Probably my fave dish of the night. If it wasn't for the fact that I had THE BEST ravioli the night before at the extremely snobbish Ristorante Il Giorgio Baldi in Santa Monica (see my review for that), I would have voted this Ravioil the best i've ever tasted. Alas. This will now be allocated 2nd best ravioli ever. But the veal...OMG\n\n- Seared Scallop on a bed of Crab in tomato and bail reduction: This was probably my 2nd least favorite dish if i had to pick one (after the too-ponzued ahi). But only because it was a little too salty and the tomato base was a little too overpowering. The scallop was done perfectly \n\n- Prime Rib Filet Mignon: Delicious! Done just the way i liked it, medium-rare\n\n- Passionfruit Canal of ice-cream in tapioca coconut sauce: When they busted out this dessert, we all thought it was a really refreshing and tasty end to the 6 course meal. However, my friend Fifi was really quite disappointed that it wasn't a chocolate dish. I don't know if Javier heard her, or he just wanted to keep us around for another 30 mins...but we ended up with ANOTHER \n\n- Dessert Trio of Peanut Butter Milkshake + Chocolate Fondant Cake + Canal of Bailey's ice-cream with crushed peanut butter brittle\nPeanut Butter Milkshake: VERY tasty. It was rich and peanut buttery and oh so yummy\nChocolate Fondant Cake: Could have been a little sweeter. It was also a little dry, but perfect with the ice-cream\nBailey's Ice-cream with crushed peanut butter brittle: YUM! Loved it!\n\n- Petit Fours/ Sweets: Generous portion of chocolates, roasted cocoa nuts, caneles, jelly...YUM\n\nJavier saved the day with the extra course of tastings.

You tell them if you have any allergies or if there's anything you don't eat. Besides that, you're in the chef's hands. In this case, Executive Chef Steve Wolf.\n\nNow, here's the thing. I'm not really sure if the ever changing chef's menu is really Chef Hubert Keller's menu, Chef Wolf's menu, or Chef Wolf channeling Chef Keller's menu. So I'm not really sure where to lay the blame for a meal that was, well, hit and miss. Don't get me wrong, there were some outstanding dishes. But there were also some dishes that missed the mark enough to make me question if they were coming from the same chef.\n\nLet's start with the positives. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. A towering space with walls of stacked stone, heavy floor to ceiling dark curtains, an imposing second floor wine cellar behind glass, and an \"eye\" of orange roses watching over a dining room of white tablecloths and brown leather banquettes and chairs. It's masculine and luxurious and opulent.\n\nThe service is also top notch, finding that balance between attentiveness and unobtrusiveness.\n\nAnd the menu had some high points. Some very high points. But the lows brought it back down to earth.\n\nWe started with an amuse of dungeness crab and avocado sphere in a watermelon gazpacho. If the amuse was to capture the essence of the meal, I would have been very happy. It was delicious, tart and refreshing. It held out the promise of a great meal.\n\nWe moved on to the 1st course of ahi tuna tartare over a shaved fennel slaw in ginger ponzu, topped with a fennel seed tuile. An ahi tuna tartare seemed like a safe, if uninspired choice, to start the meal. I've had many, as I'm sure you have, and this one was good without being remarkable. The fennel slaw beneath it was a nice touch, giving it some textural difference but the ginger ponzu sauce was overpoweringly sour.\n\nNext up was the truffled onion soup with a braised duck ragout and shaved black truffles. The braised duck ragout was served in a small rolled crepe in the middle of the dish, with the soup poured around it. This dish was the highlight of the meal. The onion soup was sweet and rich, with the taste of the truffles coming on in the end notes. The truffles were more pronounced in the crepe itself.\n\nThird course was veal and Yukon Gold potato ravioli with a sunchoke foam and English peas. The potato ravioli were very soft and tender and the veal jus lent a concentrated meaty flavor to the dish. Another good dish.\n\nThe next course was hamachi with a ginger aromatic foam and tempura scallions. My first and lasting impression was that the ginger foam was salty. This is one of the dishes that really threw me with the heavy handedness of the seasoning.\n\nThe final meat course was the Colorado rack of lamb with charred corn cous cous, mango chutney and a carrot curry sauce. The lamb was on the rare side of medium rare, just how I like it, but again the sauce was a salt lick. Salty to the point of obliterating the other tastes. The addition of curry introduced an odd flavor profile into the meal. It just seemed incongruous with the rest of the tasting menu. If I didn't know better, I'd have wondered if that plate had come from the same kitchen or even restaurant.\n\nThe intermezzo was a passion fruit and coconut sorbet on a streusel crust in a coconut soup with tapioca balls, strawberry, kiwi and plantain. I loved the coconut soup with tapioca balls. Just like an upscale boba and a perfect palate cleanser after the two salt bombs. The sorbet was also very good. This course set the meal back on track.\n\nDessert was sauterne marinated pears on a cinnamon crust and cinnamon ice cream with a walnut sesame crisp. The ice cream was good but the highlight was the cinnamon crust the dessert sat on. Delicious. The kitchen also sent out two glasses of complimentary sauterne to pair with the dessert to make up for the lamb dish. A nice gesture and a nice way to end the meal.\n\nFinally, a small tray of lemony madeleines with a chocolate dipping sauce. \n\nAnd an autographed copy of Hubert Keller's book \"Burger Bar\", a rose from the aforementioned \"eye\" and personalized menus of the night's meal. A nice touch even if a couple of the courses on the menu were not what we had received.\n\nSo there you have it. A meal, on the one hand, that exercised some restraint in bold flavors and two dishes that exhibited a heavy handedness in their seasoning and discordant flavor profiles.\n\nBut who am I to judge?\n\nJust trust me.

So when I found out I was going to Vegas for a convention I made reservations oh about 2 months in advance for an early birthday celebration.\n\nMyself and three of my girls showed up for our 730pm reservation and headed to the lounge to wait and order a martini that had Pop Rocks in it as the onlne menu suggested.  Alas, they don't make it anymore which resulted in four ladies saying \"Awwwww!\" in unison.  But we were seated before even ordering a drink so we didn't have time to be uber-disapponted.\n\nWe were seated in the back of the restaurant in a private cabana (although the curtains were not shut).  The restaurant was dimly lit with light Europop music in the background and my first impression was ooooh fancy!  I loved the atmosphere.  On the wall there is also a live flower arrangement made with 3500 individual roses with their own individual water receptacles attached to them.  They replace them every day too...aaaah Chef Keller, so niiiice!\n\nOn to the food.  I chose the Elegance menu since you cannot do the Chef's tasting menu unless the entire table does it.  Another friend did the Elegance menu, the other the Lion King three course menu, and the other the vegetarian menu.  We had an amuse bouche to start and it was some sort of fried cod and it was tasty - my friends and I both liked it.  They brought out a separate amuse bouche for the vegetarian friend as well which I thought was a nice touch.  The bread basket was also brought around and I got the foccacia which was so delicious they had to bring the bread basket around again 5 minutes later because we needed more.\n\nFirst course I had the truffled onion soup with braised duck ragout and truffles.  They bring the bowl out with items placed in the bottom and then the soup is poured on top.  That was some seriously wonderful, creamy onion soup.  I ate every last bit of it and considered sopping up the rest with my bread...or licking it clean with my tongue.\n\nSecond course I chose the veal and Yukon Gold potato ravioli with a veal jus sauce.  I thought the ravioli was tasty but I would say perhaps the sauce was a bit too salty but not too salty to eat every last bit of it.\n\nThird course I chose the filet mignon with potato puree, spinach, and wild mushrooms.  The steak was perfectly medium rare and the sauce was divine.  The potato puree looked very festive on the plate - like a potato comma at the top - and tasted as good as it looked.\n\nThe last course was dessert which we had to order when we ordered our entrees.  I got the chocolate souffle ($6 supplement) and it was worth the entire trip to Vegas just to eat this.  It comes out looking absolutely perfect and a fleur de lys design is on top in powdered sugar.  The waiters poke a hole in the top and pour the chocolate sauce in.  Then you devour it and the mocha ice cream they served with it while your eyes roll back in your head and you think \"Oh sweet baby Jesus, thank you for this excellent dessert!\"\n\nAs an added bonus the waiter brought out a special birthday dessert for me - I don't even know what it was but they had written Happy Birthday on the plate in chocolate syrup which pleased me to no end.  The manager came around to ask how our evening was and I did have to ask if Chef Keller was there....and...he....wasn't.  Damn - minus one star for the lack of superstar chef meeting!  I didn't get my chance to meet him this time, but I'll definitely stalk him down next trip. hehe\n\nThroughout the dinner the service was excellent.  Our waiter was friendly, funny, and he kept our cocktails filled (Fleurtini if you must know).  Only misstep was perhaps the long lag time between the 2nd and 3rd courses.  Not a big deal since we were just hanging out.\n\nAt the end of dinner they bring the ladies a rose from the aforementioned flower art on the wall.

The entrees were around $50 a la carte and the apps were around $20... so, why not do the prix fixe? \n\nAfter some delicious bread (rosemary foccacia and honey wheat rolls), we got our amuse busche - tempura cod and potato salad with cayanne creme fraiche. It was pretty cute - sorta like a play on fish and chips =) \n\nAnd remember when the manager came by and said he wouldn't take our coupon off email?

The soup was amazingly creamy and delicious and the duck inside the crepe was just money. *drool*\nAhi Tuna Tartare - This one was alright. I think I've had better tartares before... the fennel was definitely a little different and was good, but not my favorite flavor, I think.\n\n2nd course:\nCitrus glazed halibut - the halibut was alright, but what really blew me away was the broccoli puree. I haven't had purees much... I usually don't eat at such fancy places... but this stuff blew my mind. It tasted so freakin' good... like pure essence of broccoli. How the heck did they do that?!\nBraised Veal and Yukon Gold Potato Ravioli - This one came out pretty good, too. The potato inside the ravioli was so flavorful... \n\n3rd Course:\nFilet mignon + foie gras and truffles - This was probably THE BEST cooked piece of meat I've EVER eaten - PERFECTLY medium rare - it practically melted in my mouth... and the foie gras... the first time I've had that and the stuff just MELTED over the meat... so freakin' delicious. I'm usually not a fan of liver, but this stuff was just like butter. Paired with the filet, it was AMAZING. Totally worth the extra $25. The mashed potatoes (which was more like a puree) was equally delicious.\nStout Braised Beef Short Ribs - These were really good, too. I have to say that the mustard was my favorite part about it - but again, some of the most tender and well cooked meat I've ever had.\n\nDessert - \nChocolate Souffle - Not too shabby.... not a huge chocolate fan, but my girlfriend loved it.\nCarrot and cream cheese ice cream sandwich - Carrot cake is great, but this went beyond simple carrot cake. It was simply heavenly. The carrot-pineapple ice cream they served it with was sweet, but not overly so. And I absolutely LOVED the raspberry jam smeared on the side of the ice cream sandwich. *drool* I think if I only had the filet and this for dinner, I would've been completely satisfied.\n\nWe were also served a complimentary anniversary dessert - a play on cheesecake with scripted \"Happy Anniversary\" in chocolate. I'm tellin' yah, service here is tops!\n\nWe were also served a Petit four at the end, which came with five little dessert pieces. I think the actual desserts we had were much better... but all the little extras were great =)\n\nAll in all, some of the best food we've ever had and excellent service.

If the rest of my year is anything like the meal and experience I had here, I'll consider myself lucky. \n\nAs lovers of tasting menus, we decided to go with the full tasting menu that came with 7 courses. We started off with a dungeness crab wrapped in slices of avocado served with a watermelon gazpacho. This was fantastic. The avocado was the perfect compliment for the crab and the watermelon gazpacho offered a light contrast to the savory avocado. The next dish was a tuna tartare served with a ginger ponzu sauce. This had to be the best tuna tartare I have ever had...hands down. The ponzu sauce was spruced up with a hint of ginger and the tuna was perfectly balanced with cucumber strings. The following dish was the Nantucket Bay scallops served with frisee and a tomato confit. The scallops were so moist and flavorful. Generally, my compliant with scallops are that they are too big and lack the sweet, buttery flavor. These scallops had that wonderful flavor and a lot more. The tomato confit was very unique - the tomatoes were skinned and cooked, while maintaining it's shape and was the perfect consistency. The truffled onion soup was served with duck braised ragout and black truffles. I loved the duck braised ragout, but the soup was a little too creamy for my liking. My boyfriend loved it so it may just be a personal preference. I was more interested in the next dish, the veal and Yukon Gold potato ravioli. Wow - this was so wonderful. This dish came with sunchokes and English peas. I loved the consistency of the ravioli, and the veal sauce was mouth watering. The last of the savory dishes as a venison served with huckleberries, mushrooms, brussel sprouts, a potato puree served on a bed of red cabbage. The venison was perfectly cooked - the meat was extremely tender and flavorful. The red cabbage was slightly crunchy and worked perfectly with the meat. I was in heaven. \n\nFor desserts, we had the coconut soup with tapioca, passion fruit sorbet served on a square of banana bread. We also had the chocolate souffle, and poached pears with cinnamon ice cream. The desserts were okay - I feel like I have had better (hence the 4 stars). Overall the service was okay as well. My last comment is that I loved the decor of the restaurant. The vaulted ceilings had drapes going from floor to ceiling which gave the restaurant a very dramatic effect.

We stopped to browse the menu and noticed a monitor nearby showing clips of Hubert Keller competing on Top Chef Masters. Being big fans of the show we were instantly sold. The big pull for us was the fact that prix fixe menu came with the ability to order wine pairings. I wish all restaurants did this, seriously. We canceled our reservation at Aquaknox to make room in our foodie itinerary to eat here. \n\nWe both ordered the Elegance prix fixe with wine pairings. Each course came with a half glass of wine. We also received a sparking rose immediately after ordering which was a great way to start off the evening. (I should note that there is a less expensive prix fixe called Top Chef Masters but the menu did not indicate that there was a wine pairing option available.) \n\nI was extremely happy with the food here as was my husband. I highly recommend ordering the wine pairings with the prix fixe as the sommelier is truly talented at choosing wines that enhance the flavors of the food. For each course there is a choice of 2 to 3 dishes and my husband and I chose a wide variety of dishes. We each drank completely different wines as a result and got to enjoy the flavors of twice as many dishes. It was great!!  \n\nWe did notice another couple there sharing a prix fixe so if you are on a budget I am sure its not a problem. There is a small lounge in the front that has a tapas menu. If we didn't eat in the restaurant we probably would have considered a few cocktails and tapas in the lounge. \n\nThis place is not for rowdy groups.

It was like a Rock Band tribute band over there starting at about 10pm. We could tell the hosts were trying very hard to make sure the door stayed closed since the sound was very loud.

They obliged, seating us at a 2-top behind the curtains, right next to the private 'cabana' seating. It made for a perfectly romantic setting.\n\nWe both ordered the 'Elegance' tasting menu with wine pairings.\n\n//AMUSE BOUCHE//\n- Tempura cod with potatoes and creme fraiche\n\nCrispy on the outside, delicate on the inside. Great way to start the meal. Since we got the wine pairing, it also came with some sparkling wine.\n\n//FIRST COURSE//\n- Truffled onion soup with duck ragout and black truffles\n- Ahi tuna tartar with fennel slaw and ginger ponzu sauce\n\nThe soup was rich and creamy and the duck ragout was delicious. The tuna tartar was very good but I wasn't a huge fan of the fennel slaw. It gave the dish a little bit of an earthy taste and took away from the taste of the tuna, in my opinion. But, I'm no chef so who am I to second guess Hubert's recipe.\n\n//SECOND COURSE//\n- Pumpkin risotto with pecans\n- Chorizo stuffed sea bass\n\nThe risotto was one of the best dishes of the night, although I'm partial to anything that's pumpkin flavored. The sea bass was very good. The cut of fish was very meaty, flaky, and delicious and the chorizo provided a little kick. The wine it was paired with (a Gruner, I believe) was a perfect compliment. It was the best pairing of the night.\n\n//THIRD COURSE//\n- Stout braised short ribs\n- Filet mignon with foie gras and truffles\n\nThe filet was cooked perfectly (medium), was very tender, and not overly seasoned. I ordered the foie gras with it even though I'm not a big fan -- maybe the idea of force feeding a duck to make it's liver tender for my benefit is a turn-off for me. Although, obviously, it didn't bother me enough to prevent me from getting it. I do have to say that the foie gras was unbelievably soft and buttery. Thank you, Mr. Duck for sacrificing your organs in order to satisfy my appetite. Your life was clearly worth the $25 extra I had to pay for your liver and the truffles. All in all, it was a very good course. The epitome of a rich, decadent dish.\n\nAs good as the filet was, the short ribs were even better, in my opinion. I know, I'm crazy... how could they be better than a filet w/ foie gras and truffles? I'm not sure, but I just enjoyed the flavor of the short ribs more than the filet. Probably because it was braised in beer. It was definitely my favorite dish.\n\n//FOURTH COURSE//\n- Carrot cake with pineapple sorbet\n- Chocolate souffl\u00e9\n- White chocolate ganache\n\nThe desserts were good, but nowhere near as good as the other courses. The carrot cake was the best of the three. The white chocolate was rich, creamy and smooth. The souffl\u00e9 was my least favorite. It's meant to be light, but it was too light for my tastes and was a little bitter and not sweet enough. A decent dish but not one that I would get again.\n\nWe finished the meal with some petite fours. Among them was a peanut butter one that was very sweet and delicious. The others were largely forgettable. But they were complimentary, so I can't really complain.\n\nThe service was excellent.

My mother and I arrived a bit earlier than our reservation, so we had a seat at the bar for a pre-dinner cocktail. While I normally start with a straight gin martini, my eye was caught by the cucumber martini, with house-made cucumber-infused vodka. So I ordered it, and was horrified to watch the bartender pull out a plastic jug from the refrigerator and dump a green liquid directly into a (not chilled) martini glass and hand it to me. To me, this is unacceptable at a high-end restaurant. Drinks should not be pre-mixed, and a martini should be chilled, not refrigerator temperature. On top of that, the drink tasted like juice.\n\nOnto dinner. For the most part, it was perfectly nice. Not spectacular, but very nice. I had a fixed price menu (not the $65 early bird menu, but the regular fixed price menu). The truffled onion soup to start was very nice, though I thought it could have used a bit of salt, which was not provided. This is a bit of a pet peeve of mine -- I appreciate that chefs theoretically are making their meal exactly as you should eat it, and so I always try it their way first, but taste buds are different (and, let's be honest, some nights the chef might be off his game). That said, the soup had a braised duck crepe in it that was wonderful. \n\nMy next course was a ravioli (I can't remember exactly what the filling was), which was much tastier and seasoned properly, with a lovely rich sauce. Then i had a steak, which was of really exceptional quality and melted in my mouth. Nothing special about the steak preparation -- sauce wasn't particularly amazing, but the quality was great and it was cooked perfectly. Dessert was good, not great.\n\nTo reiterate, the food was really very good, just not worth the price, in my opinion. Service was impeccable, and the manager was incredibly helpful when I had forgotten my restaurant.com gift certificate, in that he was happy to take the number of the certificate off of my iphone in lieu of the hard copy.

I am sad to see that Fleur will be closing its doors in August because it is a great restaurant on the Strip.\n\nMy hubby and I tried their Top Chef tasting menu for $65/person.\n\nThe amuse bouche was a lightly fried cod with a warm potato salad. The cod was light and crisp while the acidity from the salad accentuated the flavours of the fish. A well thought out dish.\n\nI had the mixed greens with polenta croutons while my husband had the salmon and radish salad. The mixed green salad was phenomenal because of the crouton. Now here's the thing. I don't like croutons. I don't like polenta. But I swear to God the chef must've used some sort of magic to make those babies - such lovely texture and aroma. I could have eaten an entire plate of those. The salmon dish and the radish salad was well prepared but overall, was a little unexcitiing.\n\nSecond course was lobster mac n' cheese and the braised beef cheek with filet mignon. To be honest, the lobster mac n' cheese a miss for me. For one thing, not enough lobster flavour and the macaroni was a little more than al dente for my taste. However, it tasted wonderful regardless.\n\nThe braised beef cheek however - wow! the meat braised in five spices... one of the best beef dishes I've had in a while. I almost wished there was no filet mignon there (not because it wasn't good) because the beef cheek totally outshone it.

The menu is not listed on the website but is listed out front with the other menus, so do look for it. My wife and I ate there on 7-22-10.\n\n To begin the atmosphere of the Lounge is very relaxing as well as  inviting, with low as best I can describe Mid East style seating, with small tables and low set couches. The couches are very comfortable BTW so you may want to stay for awhile. This is a small intimate area which seats probably around 25 people at most so it can fill up on the weekends. Our hostess was charming, very engaging and an absolute sweetheart of a girl as were all employees we dealt with that evening, as you would expect from Fleur de Lys.\n\n We began our meal with a couple of drinks, a Doghead IPA for me, not bad but stout for an IPA, my wife had what is called a Fleur Fizz, a signature drink from the Lounge there. I am not much on cocktails as such, but this was a very well made and refreshing cocktail, made similiar to a New Orleans Fizz but made with Champagne instead of club soda. A great replacement IMO.\n\n We ordered the Charcutrie Tray for two and the Rock Shrimp with Glass Noodles, for what we thought was a beginner to the Tapas meal. Not the whole meal for two as it ended up being to our surprise. The Rock Shrimp and Glass noddles was a slightly spicy little dish, not so much my wife did not love it mind you, but with a taste of the world it was from as it should be. The sauce was a mix of Thai and Viet tastes blended very well, with very fresh, small Rock Shrimp, which were not skrimped on as some Tapas menus will do. The Charcutrie was a very nice mix of smoked meats with a very fresh bread, olives, cornichons, pickled fennel and a wonderful stone ground mustard. The highlight of this for me was the mix of the Pork/Goose pate and the Fennel, a wonderful combination with the sweet, smoothness of the pate and the sharpness of the fennel blending wonderfully to form a new tatse sensation I will try in the future for a recipe of my own.\n\n  Unable to decide what we wanted to do for dessert, which all sounded good I asked about the 'flights\" I saw listed on the menu. Why not finish with a drink instead of more food, always can eat again if need be :) . The flights are signature martinis in a 3 drink serving, and are available as a Tropical or Decadent choice of flights. We decided upon the Decadent flight and were not wrong in our choice as this filled the needs of both libation and dessert in one nice package, The flight consisted of a Dark Chocolate, Mocha Espresso and White Chocolate, the drinks were accompanied by Chocolate Meddalions and fresh Blackberries. The White Chocolate was my personal favorite, like drinking a wonderful White Chocolate bar, with a hint of a Martini behind it. The Espresso was my wifes favorite, she best described as very good Mocha Espresso but with a hint of Gin. This was a great finish to a great meal to say the least. The meddalions and rasberries were wonderful, fresh as out the back door rasberries and excellent chocolate.\n\n Whether looking for a quick and casual, but classy, meal or just a great way to start the evening with a drink in a relaxed, semi-casual setting, the lounge as Fleur de Lys is a choice you cannot go wrong with. The Tapas menu is extensive and priced very well, with something for everyone, the price is upscale as you would expect for Fleur de Lys but worth every penny.

The chacuterie plate was fantastic with the decadent pate, cured meats and artisan bread. \n\nThere were only few missteps - the truffle buttered popcorn, rock shrimp noodle salad and the ahi tuna tartare. The rock shrimp noodle glass noodle salad was supposed to have some sort of Asian/Vietnamese influence but fell short due to the noodles being too thick and gummy. The ahi tuna tartare was only okay and didn't really add anything new. The truffle buttered popcorn was a little bit bitter and I'm not sure why. Still the truffle really came through on that dish.\n\nThe dessert portion was awesome: 3 dishes of ice cream/sorbets, 1 ice cream float, 1 lemon ice cream with angel food cake.

I told the waitress that they were salty and she said that it was a new dish and she would tell the chef. (nothing against the waitress.. our service was good). \nMy main course was the halibut and it was nice and crunchy on the outside, but nowhere close to being moist or soft on the inside. I hate overcooked fish and this was close to overcooked for me. Also, again the corn base.. forget what it was called was salty! \nDessert - my friend got the chocolate cake and that was good.. gentle flavors and not too sweet. I got the panna cotta desert with a couple of sorbets on top. The panna cotta itself was good, but one of the berry sorbets was overpowering and too tart and didnt mix well with the peach juice base. \nAlso, for some reason they advertize a $59 early evening prefixe on their website, but we went in at 6:15 and asked the waitress, she knew nothing about it. Instead we got the Elegance pre fixe for $89.\n\nI live near SF and have eaten at several restaurants that are better. Michael Mina for one..

Plus, both my hubby's and my birthdays fall within a month of each other so it's okay to be a little on the splurging side.\n\nNormally, we either go for a nice prix fixe menu - more affordable and more complete experience. However, everytime we see something on the a la carte menu that piques our interests. So this time, we came armed with a $50 restaurant.com coupon and bit the bullet.\n\nWe ordered the organic beet salad, the foie gras tasting 3 ways, the organic chicken, the peking duck and finally, an almond panna cotta.\n\nAgain, an amuse bouche of fried cod and potato salad which was very good (like our previous visit).\n\nThe foie gras was served in three preparations with brioche - a foie gras cappucino, a foie gras seared with a fruit compote and a foie gras terrine. The cappucino was very smooth, lusciously foamy and really accented the true flavour of the foie. The seared preparation with fruite compote was a classic and well prepared. The terrine was wonderful as well. My only complaint about the dish was it could have used more warm brioche to go with the foie gras.\n\nThe organic beet salad with poached quail egg and ham was okay. For 6-7 small cubes of beets, each topped with a fleck of microgreen, with 4 quail eggs with a sliver of ham - $19 seemed overpriced. Although the presentation was astounding, I prefer their mixed green salad with polenta. Disappointingly, it was the only salad option on the a la carte appetizer menu.\n\nWe both received a free 1/2 sized portion of the halibut entree. The halibut was seared perfectly - wonderful crust - but unfortunately was a little bland in the middle portion of the fish. The accompanying sweet corn/fava bean succotash was delightful.\n\nThe peking duck was a rather large disappointment. When you tell an Asian that you're making Peking duck - that skin better be crispy. And crispy it ain't. Although the duck breast was well-cooked, the skin was nothing like Peking duck. The cloyingly saccharine sauce on top really overpowered that dish. Paired with a tough, overcooked foie gras on the bottom, you have a culinary mess on your hands.\n\nThat being said, the roast chicken dish was the best chicken dish I have had in a long time. The roasted chicken skin was so wonderfully crisp and seasoned and I savoured each bite (I normally remove the skin entirely). The moisture and texture of the meat was amazing.\n\nI have to admit - I was a little skeptical about when I saw foam covering the chicken breast. With so many restaurants using foam, it's become a bit of a cliche. But I understand why this technique was used in this case - the foam added that wonderful umami flavour of truffle without compromising the wonderful texture of the crisp chicken skin. The accompanying morel mushroom and cabbage completed this wonderfully well envisioned and balanced package of a dish.\n\nThe almond panna cotta was good but not astounding. The flavour combinations were wonderful if only the panna cotta had a better texture. To quote Nigella Lawson: [panna cotta should have] \"the quiver of a 17th century courtesan's inner thigh\". It was a little too solid for our tastes and not quite as silky smooth as other preparations we've enjoyed in the past. \n\nOf note, we were not offered petit fours at the end of our meal this evening unlike our previous prix fixe menu experience.\n\nOverall, a great meal with some highs and lows and the bill came to around $125 tip and tax (discounting the cost of the $50 coupon).", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 3, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "Oh.....my......gosh.....is all I can say about here.

First, we were seated and told the waitress what we wanted.  She said that normally, they only serve Tapas on the \"patio,\" but that she would check with the manager.

The charcuterie plate was Delicious and portion was huge!  My husband got the short ribs, and he loved them.  Delicate and wonderful hearts of palm salad.  The tossed green salad was also yummy.

We ordered the mushroom risotto to share from the dinner menu which was also very tasty with a generous helping of woody wild mushrooms. The desert of passion fruit sorbet with coconut tapioca (boba) soup was also a hit. Refreshing would best describe it\n\nTapas Pricing was very very reasonable. The passion fruit sorbet in the coconut soup was $5 for an order that easily fed 2 people, 4 shotglasses of truffle onion soup was $6, $8 for the mixed green and manchego cheese salad and for people who eat meat, the meat based tapas were also just as reasonable. \n\nNow the bad:\n\nFalse Advertising: The Tapas menu outside the restaurant mentions that the Hearts of Palm Salad is on the Tapas menu. It was not. When inside, the waitress tells us the menu has been changed and that the Palm Salad had been taken off. We had to order it from the a la carte menu for $16. Not fun.

Shook our hands and leaned down to make sure we had eye contact and thanked us for coming. So funny, but as soon as he came out to talk to us, a group of ladies walking by ( we sat on the patio) recognized him from the Top Chef, and shrieked with delight and bear hugged him over the rail.

No big deal for us, it was just so nice to see him make sure he acknowledge everyone.\n\nAfter such an unforgettable dining experience, we were told the kitchen would like to send out some more desserts.

We were considering Robuchon, Le CIrque, Guy Savoy (you know, the REALLY fancy places, like Fleur De Lys was) for my birthday dinner, and I eventually though that we had such a wonderful time here last time, why not do it again.  Well, a little research and we realized that the old restaurant no longer existed, however, in its same space is a Keller small plates place with a few of the old standards (onion soup, fleurburger) and food that's still wonderful, but in small portions with MUCH smaller prices.  That kind of made the decision for me, because where else whee I could get phenomenal food in several courses for $120-$200, here I could do the same while picking and choosing from the entire menu for even less money.\n\nWe went a little crazy with the ordering.  My passionfruit cocktail was delicious, and my girl's cocktail sampler was great, the cherry one being both of our favorite.  Follow our\n\nAMAZING:\nGnocci - these puppies were absolutely light and pillowy.  Amazing, but not lacking in flavor, as the tomato and pesto sauce underneath was strong and pungent and reduced-tasting.  Perfect.\n\nOnion soup:  These little cups on heaven are much the same as the dish from the old Fleur De Lys, sans duck.  Only $4 on the menu, you MUST have these.  They taste of sweet carmelized onion and butter in a way that can only be described as what god would make if god were trying to capture the essence of the two ingredients for some kind of sick heaven-ambrosia nectar that only heaven-creatures get to sip.  Unbelievably delicious.\n\nItalian style meatballs:  These things are mildly spicy, meaty-but-not-chewy, balls of gorgeousness only fortified by the salty minestrone-like garnish of red sauce beneath them.  They come three to an order, but I could've eaten like 9 before dropping dead of happy.\n\nYukon gold potato and veal ravioli :  Great veal reduction underneath.  The cardoons added a nice, kind of artichoke-y depth, and the micro greens on top give the dish a grassy, not-too-heavy layer.\n\nPork Schnitzel:  Expertly pounded breaded (my girl has a German grandmother and has lived in Germany) and fried, this schnitzel is great because it's a fried dish that doesn't feel like it's going to weigh you don.  The potato salad it comes with is great (if possibly only lacking a little more vinegar), and the lingonberry dollop on the plate makes you feel like you're finally eating something way better than the stuff you get at Ikea without having to fly to Scandinavia.\n\nBraised Hamachi:  These pillows of fish also remind you of the gnocci in that they're cooked perfectly, which is just enough for your teeth to sink into flesh that is neither raw nor fully cooked.  Th soy-ginger foam is the perfect salty-earthy compliment to the umami of the pickles shitakes.\n\nNampol Meesa Wings:  Chef de Cuisine Steven Wolf told us these were invented by one of Fleur's chefs at the old Fleur de Lys to feed the \nkitchen staff when the rest of the birds was used and the wings were left behind.  To me, they taste like LA's Koreatown, or like they've been soaked/braised in soy, in a very good way.  The salt is balanced with a little bit of sweet, and the meat falls right off the bone into your mouth, while the chicken skin maintains just a hint of crispiness on the outside (thank god).  With a little more crispiness in the skin, these things are perfect.  These are a fun, delicious, if not highly gourmet answer to wings. Plus, it's great to see what chefs do with a part of the bird no one really wants to eat as anything but a wing.\n\nGOOD:\nSkirt Steak:  Steak was well-cooked, although chimmichurri isn't my favorite things in the world (parsley is a waste of an herb, if you ask me).  My indifference may have something to do with the fact that the dish was (appropriately) served near the end of the meal and by this point we were getting VERY full.\n\nBrick Dough-wrapped prawns:  These were served compliments of the chef, which was lovely. Actually the most expensive small plate on the menu, the prawns were sweet, delicate, and delicious, and the tropical fruit salad on the bottom was so wonderful I ate it separately.  Together, however, the dish was a little less harmonious, and by that I only mean it didn't blow me away, but it was still great. I like my shrimp rather savory, but for people who dig a sweeter twist with your protein, go for it.\n\nMaple Glazed Pork Ribs: These were presented under a glass dome, which holds in a bunch of smoke that eclipses the riblets until removed at the table, when the smoke dissipates away in a cloud of elusive backyard-ness. The ribs themselves are cut into little bites, are are kind of a mix between traditional Southern bbq and sweet, hoisiny, Chinese ribs, leaning towards the Chinese side and leaving your fingers, should you be plebian enough to use them, sticky.\n\nDesserts were all phenomenal, but but the panna cotta and coconut soup RULE.

I was looking forward to another fabulous meal when I made reservations to dine at Fleur last week.  I was disappointed.  The dining room was noisy from the opening to the casino and the loud music from the speakers.  There were only a handful of tables with diners when I arrived.  I was there on the fifth day of Fleur's new reformatting.  Perhaps the memory of my previous meal at Fleur dy Lys (which was one of my all time favorites) tarnished my view of the new Fleur, but even the dishes I ordered did not stand up to the quality that I experienced from Hubert Keller previously.  I started with a Ceaser salad that was so oily I only ate a few bites.  The presentation of the onion soup was fun, but the soup itself wasn't especially memorable.  The proportion of the pickled shitake to the braised hamachi was off.  It might've worked better with half the amount of mushrooms.  I enjoyed the mac & cheese served in a cast iron pot, which was inspired by the Top Chef Master's episode where Chef Keller strained the pasta in a dorm shower.

They have quite a selection and our server was knowledgable. He lit the 75 proof absinthe and inverted the cup into another full of some fruit nectars. We then used straws to inhale the alcohol vapor that accumulated in the original cup. It was interesting. I didn't actually drink the absinthe, which was called Mansinthe (Marilyn Manson's brand - really,) because it tasted like rubbing alcohol. I don't know how anyone drinks it.

No matter though!\n\nThe decor and atmosphere were pretty nice though.  It was very pretty and you were able to see the wine storage room from the bottom floor.

I'm talking mixed drinks, not wines and the like (which obviously can go much higher).  I ordered the Absinthe Frappe, which wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing.  My dining partners all thought their drinks were decent but not great (as in wasn't worth $15).  We would have no problems with the drinks at $10, but for $15 or more we would've expected it to make us nod and say \"wow, this is pretty good.\"\n\nNow on to the food:\n\nPaprika Popcorn.  It wasn't bad, but it tasted seriously like popcorn with some salt and paprika.  It WAS the cheapest thing on the menu so ok, sure.  We got it because we figured it would be something to munch on while we waited for the other things to come.   But it was really quite small and we easily finished it way too quickly.\n\nOysters.  I'm not a fan of oysters so I can't talk about the taste.  On the other hand the presentation?  Incredibly cool.  Dry ice and mist rising from a really cool looking contraption.  The oysters themselves were small and you only get 3.  Friends said it tasted pretty good but not great and it they were small oysters.\n\nChicken Croquette w/ Water Cress salad.  This was actually pretty tasty.  but you got 4 fish stick sized croquettes with some water cress salad on it.  Pretty tasty though.\n\nRisotto.  I thought it was pretty good myself.  Not amazing but pretty good.  My friend who likes risotto though says she has had much better, though it was decent.\n\nMushroom Ragout.  I actually liked this quite a bit.  The mushrooms were tasty and well seasoned.  Of course I the problem is probably could've eaten the whole thing in 2 or 3 mouthfuls though (but then again you normally don't shove that much food in your mouth at once when you're fine dining).\n\nHamachi.  This was quite tasty.  The fish was good and the shittake mushrooms underneath were flavorful and tasty.  Definitely not a lot though.\n\nMac & Cheese.  Mac and Cheese and lobster seems to be a really  popular combination.  I liked it.  I've had mac & cheese + lobster in multiple places though and it wasn't any better than the other places.  My friends also agreed other places had better Mac & Cheese + Lobster.  But personally I thought it was pretty tasty.  Small portions though (see a trend?) .  I'd say you got about as much as two and a half tea cups (the ones you use in a Chinese restaurant).\n\nOnion Soup.  It was pretty tasty.  It comes with 4 shot glasses filled with soup.  Well they're probably the size of 2 shots, but pretty much you get the equivalent of 8 shots of soup.  Fairly tasty.\n\nSliders.  The sliders themselves were quite tasty.

While most (if not all) of the dishes were probably cooked and tasted okay, they were not very memorable.  Also, the portions were dainty (even for tapas) so the food felt a little pricey.  Here is a rundown on what we tried.\n\n(Cheese Platter - 4.5 stars) One of the best cheese dishes I've had.  They had a great assortment of cheeses that ranged in flavor and texture (including a pungent cheese that was presented in delicate ruffled layers like exotic mushroom petals).  Good toasts (including a sweet fruit and nut toast).  There were also good garnishes including honey, a fruit paste and a grape salad (that actually looked a lot better than it tasted).\n\n(Tiramisu - 4 stars) The tiramisu was good--nice cream, good coffee flavor and good ladyfingers.  Simple but satisfying.  The dessert was served with biscotti, which was just okay.\n\n(Tuna Tacos - 4 stars) These little crunchy tacos featured raw tuna, jalapeno, lime cilantro, and cabbage.  Good flavor, fresh and nice contrasting textures.  It was good but would not be among the best tuna dishes I've had.\n\n(Peking Duck - 3.5 stars) The duck breast was served with sauteed greens, caramelized pearl onions and date puree.  The flavors were mostly sweet and good; the greens did provide a little bitterness.  The duck was pink and juicy though not the best quality; the skin could have been more crisp.\n\n(Skirt Steak Topped With Chimchurri, Fingerling Baked Potato And Heirloom Tomato Salad - 3.5 stars) The heirloom tomato salad was fresh and was dressed in a vibrant vinaigrette.  The very tiny fingerling baked potato was topped with creme fraiche and chives.  It was okay, but when something is that small and cute, it needs to be great.  The skirt steak was juicy and tasty.\n\n(Yukon Gold Potato & Veal Ravioli - 3.5 stars) The pasta was very thin (almost translucent) and looked like Asian dumplings.  The inside veal filling was okay but not great.  It tasted pretty good though.  It was served with Tallegio cheese, which had a great flavor.\n\n(Panna Cotta With Berries Compote And Sorbet - 3 stars) The vanilla panna cotta was creamy and light, but it was overwhelmed by the heavy topping of strong and tart berries.  The sorbet was a little too icy.\n\n(Foie Gras Mousse With Huckleberry Gelee - 3 stars) The cold foie gras mousse was served in a glass and was topped with a gelee of sweet huckleberry (and accompanied by brioche toasts).  Good mix of salty and sweet but nothing spectacular.\n\n(Hummus And Baba Ganoush - 2.5 stars) One of the dips had a strong garlic flavor (can't remember which one).  Served with pita bread.  Okay but pretty standard stuff.\n\n(Angus Sliders With Red Onion, Cheese And Pear - 2.5 stars) The sliders featured juicy meat and good housemade buns.  There was too much onion though; it was overpowering.  There was a little bit of thin matchstick fries, which were just okay.\n\n(Chocolate Souffle With Chocolate Ganache And Mango Ice Cream - 2.5 stars) The chocolate souffle looked great.  Great rise and a nice design (fleur) on top.  The souffle was not right though--it was way too spongy.  Also, the chocolate ganache tasted burnt.  The ice cream was creamy and good.\n\n(Cheesecake Lollipops - 2 stars) These firm cheesecake lollipops were decorated with graham crackers and chocolate.  They looked good, but they were just okay.\n\n(Salt Cod Fritters - 2 stars) These lightly breaded hush puppies did not have a great fish center--mostly bread.  The outside was kind of soft.  While the fritters were not bland, they had a pretty boring flavor.  The romesco dipping sauce was thick and did not improve the dish.\n\nService was very good.  Great staff with many friendly, polite and attentive team members.\n\nIf Fleur was a little cheaper and the portions were bigger, I would have liked it more.  The food was decent, but if the food tasted as good as it looked, I would have walked away much more satisfied.  Still, Fleur was significantly better than the other Vegas tapas spot I tried--Julian Serrano at Aria.\n\nLocated in Mandalay Bay, parking is complimentary (valet or self-parking structure).", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 14, "useful": 15, "cool": 13}}, {"text": "An absolutely wonderful dining experience.

A year later, we're back. Although now it's just called Fleur and the concept has changed to a more casual eatery serving small plates (don't call it tapas... it's not a Spanish restaurant!). \n\nThey've got a larger \"patio\" and a central bar, along with a new facade that looks like part of a huge wicker picnic basket (I'm not a fan). The inside of the dining area is lighter -- they stripped out all the curtains -- and more open and replaced the roses mounted on the stone wall with corks. They were going with a casual feel and they got it. The space also felt a lot smaller than I remember.\n\nEvery dish we tried ranged from good to excellent:\n\nOysters ($10) - margarita sorbet, orange pur\u00e9e. 3 per order. The presentation is cool with the use of dry ice in a rectangular box with stones and seaweed. The sweetness of the sorbet and pur\u00e9e dominated any trace of the brininess or meatiness of the oysters. It was good, but an overly sweet way to start off the meal.\n\nCrab and avocado sphere ($14) - watermelon gazpacho. Another sweet dish thanks to the avocado and watermelon. It was good, but could have used something more savory in it.\n\nTuna tacos ($11) - jalape\u00f1os, lime cilantro. Amazing! The big, fat chunks of tuna were so fresh and silky smooth. It was the perfect blend of hot and cold and soft and crunchy. I want a dozen of these to go!\n\nPeking duck ($15) - greens, pearl onions, date pur\u00e9e. This is one duck dish that will make me forget about all others. Tender, juicy, rich and savory. And, the skin was crispy too. One bite with the other ingredients (that date pur\u00e9e was damn good) and I was in heaven.\n\nSkirt steak ($15) - chimmichurri, roasted fingerling potato, creme fraiche. The greens, tomato, and potato were all good but the steak was a bit tough and chewy. My least favorite dish of the night.\n\nTiramisu ($8) - coffee-marsala ladyfinger, mascarpone, chocolate. I'm no expert at tiramisu, but this was delicious. So good I wanted to lick every last drop out of the dish.\n\nFor beverages, we had two glasses of wine, a Chimay Grande Reserve, and the best porter I've ever had -- a Meantime London Porter. Sure, I don't know much about beer, but it was amazing! It had a sweet, smokey taste and a really smooth finish. \n\nThe service was ok. Our waiter was working a few tables so we didn't see him very often. The pace of the meal wasn't bad, just a little on the slow side. We were celebrating my wife's birthday and they did write happy bday on the tiramisu plate, but I was expecting, at the very least, some petit fours or some other complimentary item to end the meal. Maybe I was expecting too much but even at a place like Applebee's don't they give you something for free on your birthday?\n\nI would definitely come here again to try other items (and order more tuna tacos and another porter or two). But, I would hope that the service picks up. This place is still a little rough around the edges, but very close to being a 5 star dining experience. We ended up spending $165 (incl. tax and tip).

Chef Hubert Keller is known throughout the world not only as a classically trained French  Chef but an author and TV host has well. \n\n\n\nWe had dined at Fleur de Lys in Las  Vegas several times over the years and were always impressed with the classic d\u00e9cor , unique chefs table, immaculate service and of course great French cuisine as only Chef Keller could create.  Fleur's concept of tapas had us wondering how this would work as we walked into Chef Keller's newest creation.  \nWalking into Fleur you first notice its \" open air \" casual tables and a lively bar with plasma TVs. As we walked past the tables near the bar guided by our hostess to our table in the main dining room we gazed upward to the Chefs table overlooking the dining room surrounded by hundreds of bottles of wine which brought back fond memories of Fleur de Lys . The d\u00e9cor in the main dining room features earth tones of brown and beige with lighting in the shape of trees which gives guest a warm inviting feeling.\n\"Fleur is about globally inspired Tapas\" stated GM Owen Deignan as he met us at our table and welcomed us to Fleur.  The word \"global\" inspired us so we put ourselves in the very capable hands of   Chef Keller and his Chef de Cuisine  Steven Wolf.\nOur first stop as always,  was  perusing  through the very extensive wine list. The wine list features most of the \"trophy\" wines that you would expect from a venue such as Fleur but also offered a nice variety of wines from $ 60.00 and up. We chose a nice Cote du Rhone that we expected should pair well with whatever Chef Keller and Chef Wolf sent out. \n\n\n tuna tacos jalape\u00f1o, lime cilantro\n \n  When our very attentive server brought out the AHI  Tuna Tacos , the dish was so pleasing to the eye we just wanted to stare at before we went any further.  The expression \" you eat with your eyes\"   could not be more true of this dish. The pepper provided just the right heat and a nice avocado foam to cool things down made this a very balanced dish and one of our favorites of the night.\n\nmerguez sausage saffron couscous, harissa\n We waited with anticipation to see where the Chefs would take us for our next stop . A North African dish that is also popular in Northern Europe, The Merguez sausage  with saffron gave our palates at treat of some wonderful exotic flavors that Chef Keller creates better than none other.\n\nangus sliders blue cheese, onion, bacon, pear\nWhat would a Tapas restaurant be with out Sliders ?  Fleur does it as good as anyone with juicy Angus Sliders with creamy blue cheese , onion , crispy bacon and a nice contrast of pear.

Of course  ! and it was now time for the finale and what a finale it was.  A Cr\u00e8me Brulee  trio featuring Earl Grey , Orange and Cookie was a exquisite introduction into one of the best Chocolate Souffle's we have had.  The lightness of the Earl Grey  was the perfect lead into the Souffle at the end. These dishes were decadant, delicious and should not be missed .\n\n\nFluer has a couple great specials to indulge in as well.

My boyfriend was immediately weary but I was still pretty excited to try good food!\n\nThe best way to describe some of the food is \"whimsical\" - my boyfriend got chicken croquettes and the skirt steak, which said came with \"fingerling potato.\" When it came out it was literally *one* fingerling potato made to look like a mini baked potato.

Really brief dish that was hard to appreciate when theres so little there to remember!\n\nHowever the desserts were definitely some of my favorite during the trip.

If you read my original review, you will see that I was in love with Fleur de Lys.  Not only for the happy hour, my last visit involved the tasting menu with wine pairings in a private cabana which left me raving until they closed.  And then I cried.  Well not really but I was real sad.  You see, Fleur de Lys was like a sanctuary.  A quiet place with great food and bevs where we could escape.\n\nSo you can imagine how excited I was that they were reopening.  I knew they were reconcepting, but I wanted to give it a go anyway.  Last night was my first night in town so I made a reservation and went by asap.  \n\nWell let me tell you.  I'm not that much of a fan.  The menu is a little bit of everything with small plates mostly in the $11 - $15 range but sprinkled with your token ridiculously expensive items.  Like the one for $5000.  Not joking.  There's a $5000 burger on the menu and, oh yeah, it comes with champagne.  I decided it should come with a hooker as well...or some fancy imported dijon hooker, or maybe two hookers.  Or maybe \"burger\" is code word for crack or something.  But we determined that it would have to be about 8 lbs of crack...plus the dijon hookers.\n\nAnyhow, the decisions were difficult, as there was nothing all that interesting there.  Online it looked like they had a few prix fixe options but the only ones last night were \"eat the menu\" for like $485 and the couples Valentine menu.  I asked our server for recommendations and he said that the ravioli, skirt steak and the duck were the most interesting dishes.  Really?  Yeah.  I ordered the peking duck, the scallop goulash...and the veal ravioli when I was done with those because I was still starving.  The \"peking\" duck was really just a few small pieces of roast duck and the horseradish in the goulash was nonexistent.  The veal ravioli was pretty good, though.\n\nI will say that Chef Keller was actually around last night and was very gracious, taking time to greet people and take photos with them.  Nice.\n\nSo anyway.  I'm sad again.  It seems like they've pretty much dumbed the place down to appeal to the masses.

It allows people to try things without risking too much. \n\nI started with a fun Flight of three cocktails that  included The Sumo, made with Sake and Yuzu Juice.  The Fleurtini, a pomegranate based Martini and The Sparkling Peach Blossom, a mix of prosecco (I think) and Peach Nectar. Each glass came perched on a slice of Cucumber, which I ate after finishing each small drink to clear my palate.   Even though I am not a huge Mixed Drink Guy, this was a great way to experience a lot of different flavor combinations and was a lot of fun.\n\nNext, I ordered the \"In The Shower\" Lobster Mac and Cheese.  I Loved it! I thought the portion was generous for the price and it was rich, creamy, cheesy and a delicious.  They may have tweaked the recipe and presentation recently because the dish didn't resemble the description by other Yelpers at all.  Mine came in a large artsy soup bowl (not a small Ramekin), had toasted breadcrumbs on top and was not runny at all.  At first, I didn't see much lobster, but soon discovered a ton of it at the bottom of the bowl. A quick stir and the excellently cooked, sweet lobster was evenly distributed throughout my dish.\n\nFor dessert, I debated the Coconut Soup or the Souffle, but decided on the Affogato a la LN2.  Trust me...This is a MUST for any Top Chef Fan or anyone interested in Avant Garde Cuisine. This version of the classic Coffee drink was made table side using Liquid Nitrogen to make a rich and amazingly smooth Bailey's Ice Cream.  Next, one of the best cups of espresso I've ever  had was poured over the Ice Cream.  The result was a wonderful combination of tastes, textures and temperatures.  I want to try the other desserts, but it will be difficult not to order this every time I am in Vegas!\n\nMy food at Fleur was Five Star quality.

We decided on having the tuna tacos ($13), the green gazpacho ($14), the Tarte Flamb\u00e9 ($11), and the \"In the shower\" mac & cheese ($18).  \n\nThe tuna tacos were a dish comprised of three small, just over bite-size, tacos with sushi grade tuna chunks accompanied by serrano chilies, cilantro, and avocado cream.  The tacos were flavorful, but the dish was a bit pricey given their size.  The green gazpacho was a wonderfully-balanced chilled soup of pureed tomatillos, green peppers and cilantro.  It was served with a small but tasty Jonah crab salad sandwich.  The star of this dish, however, was the soup.  Very refreshing and perfect for a warm Spring day!  The Tarte Flamb\u00e9, a flatbread topped caramelized onions, bacon, truffle, asparagus, and cr\u00e8me fraiche.  It was a veritable tie between the gazpacho and the tarte for top honors for our meal.  Last, but sadly least, was the mac & cheese.  It was supposedly made with lobster, brunoise vegetables, and cheese, but what we received was woefully short on the lobster and veggies.  What was there was so finely diced, denying us the opportunity to get any sense of taste of lobster.  There was seemingly a reasonable amount of cheese, but it was surprisingly bland, excessively runny, and didn't really provide the gooey cheesiness that one would expect.  Of course, perhaps the \"in the shower\" part of its name referred to the fact that the cheese would be wet and runny by design.  Nevertheless, I've had much, much better lobster mac & cheese for much less money.  Service throughout the meal was satisfactory.\n\nFleur is a good restaurant, but a bit uneven in its lunch choices.  Perhaps the dinner service offers a greater, more even experience.  Still, don't get me wrong.  If you order the tarte and the gazpacho (both 4 star dishes), and perhaps the tacos (3 stars), you'll be pleased.

Figured it would be a good place to get a small bite since we were planning on a big dinner. We got four appetizers and honestly it was the perfect amount of food. To start with we got the tuna tacos. They were actually very good, the taco itself was a crispy (rather than soft) style taco. The sushi grade tuna was accompanied by a bit of spice supplied by some Serrano. This was a good dish, if perhaps a bit overpriced, though perhaps since it was sushi grade I shouldn't complain? The second dish was the highlight of the lunch - gazpacho. This was a green gazpacho and it was made from tomatillos. It was delicious, refreshing and made me want more! Next came a nice little flat-bread; the caramelized onions, bacon and truffle gave it a sweet/savory bite - very satisfying. The big disappointment of the meal came from the lobster mac and cheese. Not only was it not that flavorful, but it was runny! Seriously? make it gooey, not runny; it was almost like the pasta wasn't drained prior to adding the cheese. Also - the lobster in it was not very plentiful. For the price, I would have expected a better quality dish. \n\nThis was probably closer to a 3.5 star experience and though I might go back, its definitely not up there as a high priority (though if I do go back, I might have to get some more of that soup!)", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Ate here for a snack & the food was tasty, but not sure if it's worth the price.

I didn't think Hubert Keller could disappoint. \n\nI do have to disclose that I tried to cancel my reservation earlier that day. My group had decided we wanted to do something a lot more casual for dinner. Despite their 24 hour cancellation policy, I was told when I made the reservation that they're not strict about it and that as long as you call before your reservation, you won't be charged the ridiculous no-show fee. When I called, they gave me a lot of trouble, telling me that they had a ridiculously busy night and that cancelling the reservation would absolutely mean I'd be charged $50 per person. She even went as far to tell me that if I tried to pull a loophole on her by changing my reservation then canceling it 24 hours before my reservation, I would still be charged. Thank goodness my group of friends were troopers and decided to give the restaurant a try. \n\nWhen we got there, the restaurant wasn't busy at all. The lady on the phone emphasized how busy they were and were going out of their way to accommodate our large party of 9. There was plenty of room in the back in the 'real restaurant area' but we were put in the very front in the mall area. It felt like we were eating in a food court. \n\nThe entire meal was a disappointment. The service was mediocre at best. We had a party of 9 so we were able to order a lot of plates off the menu. There were more than 3 dishes that the wait staff got wrong. We kept getting dishes we didn't order and we got repeats of dishes that were already served. When we pointed them out to the servers, they simply said \"The kitchen hates it when we send food back so just eat it.\" \n\nThe food was nothing spectacular. Not only did nothing taste particularly flavorful, nothing came out at the right temperature. Everything we ordered came luke warm. The server kept warning us that the lobster mac and cheese was extremely hot but it wasn't. We could've put our face to the baking dish without our skin turning red. The mussels were bland, the braised hamachi came highly recommended by the wait staff but it came swimming in so much sauce that you couldn't even tell you were eating fish. My friends ordered the Fleur burger but the waiter instructed them to pour the red wine reduction sauce all over the burger that it completely masked the taste of the wagyu, foie and truffle. The worst dish even though its a side dish must've been the Tarte Flambee. It was simply onions on flatbread, both underwhelming and tasteless. \n\nThe only highlight to the meal was dessert. The chocolate souffle and the creme brulee trio were the only dishes that were satisfying.\n\nAfter food, wine, tip and tax, the bill came out to $78 per person.

So I love small plates.  I just like to share and try a whole bunch of little things.  So this place wins me over on concept alone. \n\nWe tried the tuna tacos, skirt steak, nampol messa wings, and artichoke barigoule.  The tuna tacos were good, but a little to big to eat in one bite and a little too messy to not eat in one bite.  They need to be smaller or less crunchy.  \n\nThe skirt steak was good, but it came with one tiny fingerling potato that wasn't really shareable.  I don't think there is a potato crisis right now so pony up a few more.  It came with a ton of tomatoes.  \n\nThe nampol messa wings were extremely tasty.  Right amount of spice, meat came right off the bone, and the salad they came with was very tangy and crunchy.  A good contrast to the wings.\n\nThe artichoke barigoule had issues.  The carrots, artichoke hearts, asparagus, and tomatoes were ok but they just tasted like vegetables.  They hadn't soaked up any of the sauce.  The cheese was excellent but we needed more of it.  And we didn't realize that there were spoons on the table in a little box until after they took the dish away.  It may have been better with spoons to get more of the sauce.  I'm not getting the concept of having a box of spoons on the table anyway.  They give you a fork and knife... why are the spoons self-service?\n\nOne of the things I really liked is their flight of cocktails.  The tropical flight was delightful with a Sumo, sparkling peach, and cherry limeade.  The cocktails were large enough to get a good buzz on.  And you get to try three different cocktails!  Pretty good for 18 bucks.\n\nThey can make any cocktail with liquid nitrogen for $25.  We didn't go for this.  But we did go for the affogato a la LN2 served tableside for $15.  LN2 stands for liquid nitrogen, by the way.  They mix it right at your table and you get all the smoke and the ooos and ahhs from other tables.  It's a nice touch.  And the dessert is delicious.  I couldn't have much because it has espresso in it, but still very tasty.  Also, the PB&J macaroons with tiny rum shakes are to die for.  \n\nThe decor pretty much looks like Fleur de Lys did, at least when you get into the inside dining room.  Feels fancy but then you look at the 300-lb tourist spilling out of his shorts and t-shirt eating with a camera around his neck and think, maybe not. But I'm disappointed that they took out the roses on the wall and just put in tile or something.  I heard the roses were gone and I thought it was because of some major remodel.  But the frame is still there, they just took the roses away.  Don't know why because they were charming and everyone raved about them.\n\nService was very good, except for the spoon issue.  Could have let a sister know!  I definitely recommend coming here for the meat dishes or dessert.

(Have to give a shout out to my husband for the recommendation!) We waited a very short time for a table considering it was the busy lunch hour. When we were seated, our server came over promptly and began talking with us. I discussed Chef Keller with him and how excited I was to be eating there, to which he stated \"Would you like a picture with him? He is sitting right behind you.\"\n\nI said something to the effect of \"Shut the f**k up!!!!\" (not my proudest moment, but it shows you how excited I was that the word vomit just came pouring out). He smiled politely and said he would send him over in a little bit.\n\nWe began ordering, which was quite difficult since everything on the menu looked amazing!! I ordered the Cuban panini (might I add, so did Chef Keller...but I'm not a stalker or anything). This sandwich was PERFECT. The horseradish mustard gave it just the right kick, and I could feel it all through my sinuses. I also got the homemade gnocchi with pesto. Thank god for homemade gnocchi! These little balls of deliciousness were just the right texture and consistency. \n\nMy friends ordered the Caesar salad, the Italian style meatballs with pasta fagioli soup underneath them. They also had the sliders and the tuna tacos. All of these items were delicious and perfectly seasoned. The tuna tacos were the standout item of what my friends ordered...they used very thin slices of tuna tartare, which gave just the right amount of flavor and texture against the crunchy taco shell. We also all shared the macaroni and cheese with lobster. I'm not a huge seafood fan, especially when it is mixed in to one of my favorite comfort foods, but the server recommended it and he was spot on. The only reason we didn't finish it is because we were too full from all our other items, plus...there was the matter of ordering dessert.\n\nFor those of you who know me, I am not a huge fan of dessert to begin with, but everything was so good I just had to have one more course. I ordered (are you ready for this???) my absolute hands down favorite dessert of all time! It was the coconut soup with passionfruit sorbet. Sounds weird, I know, but it was unbelievable! They had topped the runny coconut soup/tapioca mixture with cold passionfruit sorbet and crunchy dehydrated fruit. I can't say enough about it. I could eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. My friends had the panna cotta, which was good, and fairly standard. We also got a couple cheesecake lollies sent over from the table next to us (apparently, their family of 8 had eaten too much too). Wonderful and a very playful take on classic cheesecake.\n\nFinally, Chef Keller came over to talk with us. We snapped a few photos, told him how delighted we were over meeting him and how much we enjoyed his meal, and then were off to enjoy more of our CE.

The staff could not have been more friendly, but they failed to manage their ambiance well, and the food lacked consistency.\n\nThe biggest problem with the restaurant, in my opinion, is that the main dining room is totally open to the casino, which allows the loud cacophony of casino sounds into the ambiance of the dining experience. The clang and whir of slot machines, different rock and roll songs from multiple other open venues, and the continuous mumble and rumble of the migrating hordes intrude on your dining experience continuously. Do not expect to \"get away from it all\" at this restaurant. You'll be smack dab in the middle of the action while you try to concentrate on your tuna tacos. Music played in the dining room just added to the ruckus and made me wish I had brought earplugs. Overall a very jarring experience.\n\nThe food was creative but uneven. Of the five \"tapas\" I ordered, only two really satisfied: tuna tacos and lobster macaroni and cheese. The tiny tuna tacos burst with bright flavors that popped in your mouth. My only criticism: teasingly small. The macaroni showed nice restraint -- too many lobster or truffle dishes nowadays coat the mouth with richness. This one comes off as balanced, with a gentle, soothing effect that lingers. Happy food.\n\nThe rest of the dishes were less than stellar. The oyster presentation was a bit ridiculous, served atop a martini glass filled with blue steaming liquid. The earthy brine of the oysters did not marry well with the melon balls that were served atop them. Creative but not great. They also comped me a deep fried chicken nugget on mayonnaise and nuts. Not my thing?\n\nThe wine list showed ambition, but lacked commitment. It covers lots of ground, but most of the producers it features are garden variety.\n\nOn the other hand the staff was lovely and attentive. Dishes were whisked on and off of the table with impressive efficiency. Every request was greeted with cheerful enthusiasm, which helped make my overall experience a mildly positive one. \n\nI cannot honestly say I had a great first experience at Fleur, but considering the creativity and friendly attitude, I will definitely try it again.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Here's the thing.

My wife and I were so excited about experiencing Hubert Keller's food.  And small plates!  Love small plates.  We were that maybe this restaurant would be able to compete with Joel Rubuchon's L'Atelier...?\n\nNo.  Not even in the same league.\n\nWe ask to sit inside as we assumed it would be quieter than the patio area opposite the loud rock band that were murdering some old classics across the walkway.  Instead, we find that the room is dominated by a large crowd of obnoxiously loud guests, clearly much to the chagrin of all the other guests in the restaurant.  The hostess just laughs at the fact that we chose to come inside and it is louder there.\n\nThe wait staff were not much more impressive.  Our waitress was somewhat apathetic.  In between courses, the table did not get cleaned and the drops of sauce and various crumbs just continued to build up.  Our table was not bussed between courses, and it seemed that the staff expected us to eat our fish dishes using our fig jam covered silverware off dirty plates.  When we had complaints about the food (see below), there was no acknowledgement to the problem, let alone an apology.  We also ordered 7 dishes and only ever received 6 of them...\n\nAll of this could have been overlooked had the food been spectacular, but it was not.  I very much doubt that Hubert Keller would put out that kind of food had he himself been there; clearly there were problems with quality control.  \n\nBy dishes:\nThe fig flambee (which is a flatbread - who knew?  Just assumed flambee on a french menu meant that it had been flamed.  Would have been nice if that had been mentioned when we ordered it) was dominated by goat cheese; the fig was battling for attention and the pancetta was essentially non-existant.  \nThe tartar was bland (clearly had not seen a hint of seasoning), even with the addition of the accompanying sauces etc. and the meat appeared somewhat low quality in and of itself.\nThe seared shrimp was OK.  Nice heat, shrimp cooked well. \nThe hamachi was, in my opinion, the best dish of the night: the foam was outstanding and the pickled shiitake were sumptuous.\nThe salt wings were fantastic, but I can get a whole bunch of those for the same price at our local Thai restaurant.\nThen came the risotto: as soon as it arrived on the table I wanted to hold the plate upside down over my head as it was clearly way too stiff.  Tried it anyway, and it tasted like bland mush with leaves added.  Underseasoned, no creaminess at all, and just horribly overcooked.  Had to send the dish back.  Thankfully they took it off the tab.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't bother going back unless I heard that the quality control problems had been addressed.  When you are paying $70 a head you deserve better, and there is much better out there on the strip.\n\n\nP.S.  Just checked out the rating graph on Fleur - was getting great reviews until the beginning of September, at which time the ratings have plummeted.  Coincidence?  I think not.

He didn't give us any crap for having a restaurant.com which some nicer places tend to do.  Second, he was funny and checked in the right amount of time.  Food had good timing- we were able to enjoy a couple plates at a time with the next sets coming out right when we were ready for them.  Also, dished had great presentation. Some come out on dry ice which is always fun.\n\nThe food- we had the fleur burger 5000... Yeah right! While it would be funny to use a coupon for that, there is no way I would order it!  \n\nCroque Monsieur- thought it was going to be croquettes (that's our fault).  It was okay but not what we expected.  The waiter asked if we liked it and we told him it was not what we thought it would be. He took it away and took it off the bill.  We replaced with the chicken croquettes which is what we originally thought we were getting.  They lacked a little bit of flavor- guess I just like the ones I make at home a little bit better.\n\nRisotto- freaking awesome.  I love Parmesan in my risotto and this did not disappoint.  Very strong, bold favors.\n\nTuna tacos- these were pretty good.   Not disappointing, but nothing extra special about them.\n\nCeviche- really enjoyed this one.

Wow, what a huge disappointment.  The flavor of some of the dishes was \"good\", but not great; others were simply bland, ordinary and disappointing. Service was less than adequate; dirty dishes were never cleared away, even after 3 courses of small plates. In fact, when my final dish arrived, the waiter looked down at me as if to say \"why aren't you moving that empty dirty plate out of the way so I can set this down and walk away\"?\n\nWe ordered a few starters.  The marinated olives for $3 were the equivalent of what I can pick up at Safeway for a buck; nothing special at all, and I'm not sure sitting in a pool of plain olive oil really qualifies as \"marinated\".  For kicks, we also ordered the Parmesan Paprika Popcorn (also $3).  It was a tiny (yes, tiny) bowl of stale popcorn with powdered parm and paprika sprinkled on it. I'm not sure what why we expected anything else, but it was pretty much like low-quality AMC theater popcorn with Harkin's flavored sprinkles on top....at 10 times the price of movie theater popcorn.  The high point of the appetizers was the ceviche, but again....nothing better than you'd expect at any nice restaurant, and again very overpriced for the size of the portion.\n\nFor dinner, I had the Manchego Salad. Seriously, I make a better Manchego Salad at home...this was like spring greens mix from a bag with some grated Manchego on top; even the dressing was unexceptional.  My last plate was the meatballs, which were served in a hot pot with some broccoli rabe.  The flavor was nice, and the broccoli rabe steamed nicely...but 5 meatballs the size of ping-pong balls with 3oz. of broccoli rabe and a smattering of sauce that barely covered the bottom of the hot pot was not at all worth $14.   It should have been a $5 small plate.  \n\nOthers at the table had the Fleur Burger...again tiny and ordinary, at $35.  Seriously, a $35 burger should be a knock your socks off burger.  Not at all. Slow roasted Alaskan Halibut was the quality of the buffet food we had in our conference earlier in the day.  And two of us had the risotto, which was probably a 2oz. portion.  I mean, teeny-tiny.\n\nIf any of this food had been presented on Top Chef, the cook would have been eliminated.  What a huge bummer for us all.

A rundown of the things I remember:\nCaesar salad - just watch out for the anchovies.  There were these 2 salty, cold bites of fish that kind of jolted me, since the lighting was dim & didn't expect it.  Otherwise, a nice starter\nceviche - served with tortilla chips.

I rarely eat this, but I thought this was quite tasty\nskirt steak - the chimichurri sauce was kind of thick, like salad dressing and not exactly what I was expecting.  Usually I think of chimichurri as a little more oily and thin, but the steak was cooked very nicely\nlobster mac & cheese - the classic kid food, all grown up!\n\nI could go on and on, but I want to get to dessert, because there was something that I just had to get.

Probably the best dessert that I have had all year!  \n\nThe service is attentive, and the other thing that really stood out is how everything is served beautifully.

We ordered the Croque Monseuir which is pretty much a grilled ham and cheese sandwich. Simple but delicious! The tuna tacos were one of my favorites but didn't impress my fellow diner as much. The braised Hamachi with soy ginger foam was a little overdone and salty. Not to mention that when one of the servers dropped it off he failed to tell me that the plate was extremely hot.

How easy is that?\n\nTomato Flambe - Not what we were expecting at all - my wife said she thought it would be a stuffed tomato lit on fire but it turned out to be a flatbread with tomato and microbasil - a bit like a margherita pizza but lighter.  It's a classic blend of flavors and was prepared well.\n\n\"In the shower\" Lobster Mac and Cheese - I assumed this was a shout out to Keller's dorm-room pasta from Top Chef Masters and as such, had to order it.  The macaroni is the small elbow type that is exactly like what you'd get out of a Kraft box, but it's made luxurious with the lobster meat and cheesy bread crumb topping.  For a \"small plate\" the portion for this was huge - it could be a full entree by itself.\n\nHambul \"Wings\" - A spicy Thai take on Buffalo-style chicken wings.  There were only six flats on the plate, so this is definitely a light appetizer.  The wings were well-cooked and the glaze was sweet and hot.  I think it was a successful dish.\n\nCreamy Polenta - This was absolutely fantastic.  It had small pieces a charred corn and parmesan mixed throughout, giving it texture and little pops of flavor.  Delicious.\n\nFleur Burger - This is a burger that knows exactly what it's trying to do.  It's a thick, perfectly cooked and seasoned patty of tender Wagyu beef, possibly with cheese, on a bun.  Don't expect toppings to get in between you and the meat - this burger is simply about appreciating the flavor of the beef.  My only minor complaint was that the juices from the meat soaked into the brioche bun and the resulting texture was less than optimal.\n\nTableside Bailey's and Espresso Ice Cream - How do they do tableside ice cream, you ask?  With liquid nitrogen of course!  Our waiter brought over a tray with a metal bowl, a flask of Bailey's creme anglaise, a shot of espresso, and a carafe of liquid nitrogen.  The Bailey's creme anglaise gets turned into almost instant ice cream, then the espresso gets poured on top followed by another dose of LN2 to refreeze everything.  Novel idea with spectacular results.  I need to make some Bailey's ice cream now and pour espresso over it at home - what a brilliant after-dinner treat.\n\nAfter the discount this wound up being $55 ($59 if you count the cost of the certificate).

The serving size for this dish was surprising large compared to other dishes. \n\nNampol meesa\"wings\" spicy, salty, sweet - These are tiny little chicken wings! I found these to be very salty and lacking in the flavor department. They had a nice crispness to them, but hard to eat due to the saltiness.\n\nSkirt steak* chimmichurri, roasted fingerling, cr\u00e8me fraiche - This was definitely a low point of the meal, the chimmichurri was a really weird and unappetizing paste, not a traditional chimmichurri at all. They seriously mean fingerling, you literally get 1 tiny potato, which we split 3 ways.

A short Google search later Fleur by Hubert Keller was agreed upon. The fault goes to us for not doing the research well enough, but it should be shared by whomever is promoting this restaurant and placing it under the French categories. The only thing French about it were the names of the dishes and the amount of Absinthe on the menu. \n\nFor the sake of this review, let's forget that fact completely. \n\nWe were recommended the Tuna Tacos - the Tuna \"mini\" Tacos. A complete throw away item on the menu. There was nothing special or delicate about it. Not even the tuna itself. As a matter of fact, the slice of jalapeno atop the taco completely killed my pallet. I am no stranger to spicy food, as a matter of fact I like it, but this miniature dish was extremely out of balance.\n\nOther dishes included, the Ceviche, Mac and Cheese and the most French sounding item, Vegetable Bouillabaisse. The bouillabaisse turned out to be the best thing on the menu, Perfectly seasoned, very well balanced and satisfying. I would have been very happy with a giant bowl of this soup and nothing else. Who knew, right?\n\nThe Lobster Mac & Cheese had nothing new or even above average to offer. The lobster pieces were a bit chewy as well. The Ceviche has some guacamole on the bottom of the serving glass which you probably should mix in with the rest of the dish, but there was no instruction from the waiter. I know, I know. \"Shouldn't you know how to eat ceviche by now?\" You may ask. Well, I do and I should, but when there is an idea as to how to enjoy a specific item in the chef's eye, then it is the job of the waiter to convey that. That's my opinion and I'm sticking to it. \n\nOverall the meal was pretty mediocre. I expected a lot more Hubert Keller amd for the money spent.\n\nWe also had a Pot de Creme dessert, which was good, but nothing to write home about aside from a gold leaf a top the cream. \n\nI suggest saving your money for a different restaurant in Vegas - there are hundreds of them!", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 4, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "I had really high expectations for Fleur.

From the start, I was mildly disappointed.  The hostess wasn't very friendly, and the restaurant itself had an overly  casual bar feel to it.  It was also loud for a while because there was a live band playing just across the way.  The menu of small and large plates is huge with many exciting options, but  unfortunately many fell flat for me.  The lobster mac and cheese was way too mild and not very flavorful.  The duck was really tender but could have used more zing to the flavors.  The accompanying braised veggies ( rhubarb, celery, and chipolini onion) were not appetizing at all - they looked limp and were oily and flavorless.  My favorite was the garlic fries which were incredibly rich due to the truffle oil.  The service was inconsistent.  Drinks were not refilled after the first refill, and it took an unexpectedly long time for extra things that were requested (e.g., lime) to be brought to the table.  The serviced really dropped off toward the end of the meal when we felt a bit overlooked.  There also seemed to be problems with expediting the food in a reasonable time period.  Even though all the dishes don't need to come out at the same time, we had to wait so long for our last plate (the truffle fries) that we thought they had forgotten about them.   While this wasn't a horrible dining experience, it was a bit frustrating because I had such high hopes for Hubert Keller's food, and the flavors just weren't there.

The young asian girl that manned the front barely made eye contact with us, was so cold, never smiled, and was really good at making you feel unimportant.  We checked in with her for our reservations, and stepped aside about 2 feet away from her to wait as she asked.

I mean really - we're no Brangelina, but didn't she just talk to us a second ago?

It was so good that I was worried that there might not be enough, but the huzbeau and I were able to have at least three shots each.\n\nThe tender Braised Hamachi rested on top of some very flavorful pickled shiitake mushrooms and the blanket of soy ginger foam on it rounded out each bite perfectly.

We ordered the meat medium rare and although it tasted fine, there were parts of the filet that were chewy.  The potatoes were just ok too.  Both were presented very nicely but they just weren't that notable as I'd hope they'd be. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=V7Ec-Y_rYuYJB_ECfzeVuw\n\nMost reviewers seem to like the Sangria and I'm assuming that they had the red.

The beef was tender and flavorful, the noodles perfect, the cheese mild but added a great flavor to the dish. Plus, the baby carrots were delicious. I could have eaten like 4 of these things, no joke. Then dessert. I gave myself a 1-meal reprieve from my ban of sweets in honor of restaurant week, and it was definitely worth it.

Despite the quality of the food, the portions were incredibly dainty making Fleur feel quite overpriced.\n\nFor lunch, Fleur works better though (at least in terms of value).  There is a mix of small plates so you can get a small taste of what Fleur cooks up at dinner.  There are also more substantial lunch plates--sandwiches and salads but also entrees like steak frites and salmon.\n\nI started with the burrata salad--something I would expect to see on the dinner menu and it was actually a substantial starter.  There was a generous portion of burrata, which was very creamy.  The burrata sat on some good, juicy and sweet heirloom tomatoes.  The burrata was topped with tomato pearls.\n\nThere was also olive oil powder and basil powder.  The basil powder had a stronger flavor, but the olive oil powder had a more memorable texture as it turned to almost cream upon tasting it.\n\nEverything was garnished with a really good balsamic--a very deep and rich flavor.  There was also a side of bread, which was just okay--they probably should have toasted it.\n\nFor my entree, I went with the steak frites, which included a very generous portion of hanger steak.  There were two pieces of steak.  One was cooked very nicely.  It was incredibly tender and also quite juicy.  The even cooking of the steak (maybe it was sous vide) was very impressive.  There was also a good outside sear.\n\nThe other piece of steak was not as good (maybe the unevenness of temperature had to with how the pieces were quite different in size).  The steak was okay, but it was not as tender and a little dry in parts.\n\nThe steak had a good flavor; I still would have preferred more seasoning because the sauce was too light in flavor to add much.  With steak frites, I like a richer bordelaise like the one at Lucques (Los Angeles).\n\nThe herb garlic frites were nice and crisp.  The frites were a little uneven in seasoning as some frites had more of a garlic flavor, which was nice.\n\nThey had several desserts, but I didn't think much sounded exciting.  I ended up opting for the almond panna cotta.  The panna cotta was topped with strawberry citrus soup and then garnished with blackberries, streusel, and kalamansi blackberry sorbet.  The panna cotta had a great consistency.  It was creamy, smooth and light.\n\nThere was not much of an almond flavor while there was an overabundance of strawberry citrus soup.  The strawberry soup kind of overpowered the panna cotta.\n\nI liked the streusel, which was buttery and crisp.  The kalamansi blackberry sorbet was also good--not icy and very cool and refreshing.\n\nService was very good.  My server was personable and polite.  He was also very attentive and intuitive even though he had to service many tables.  The hostess was nice too (and attractive if that is important to you).\n\nAs mentioned, prices are not too bad.  Almost everything was priced under $20 and portions were more than generous on a few plates.\n\nFor lunch, only the cafe is open.  While the decor is nice and contemporary, it is close to the casino so you have to deal with casino noise; the cigarette smoke also wafts over a little bit, which is unfortunate.\n\nFor dinner, the main dining room is much nicer.  The room is very contemporary, but it is also very warm (great use of warm colors) and inviting.  It is also farther back in the restaurant, which makes it feel like a nice and relaxing retreat from Vegas.\n\nThe food at Fleur is good for both lunch and dinner, but lunch is much more affordable.

This place is definitely not high on value and probably turning an enormous profit on some dishes (ahi tuna tacos come to mind, 3 two-square inch tacos for $12), but some of it is really worth it and not enough to make me knock it down from five stars. \n\nOne thing that would have made me knock it from five stars is the fact that my reservation was not in the computer. Luckily there were literally two other tables in the whole place, but had I spent 10 minutes on the Mandalay Bay reservations line and not gotten a table, I would have been furious and not enjoyed my meal so much, if I would have bothered to stay. A caveat to keep your confirmation number when making a reservation. \n\nWe ordered 9 small plates and a dessert, all for two. I had a restaurant.com coupon and wasn't sure if I would ever be back, so we decided to go all out. The server suggested that we get around 3 per person, but considering how small a few of the small plates were, 9 would have been necessary.\n\nStarting off with the not so great, for myriad reasons:\n-Manchego salad - a teeny little dusting of manchego on top of a salad. I was expecting, you know, a lot of manchego considering it is the namesake of the salad. It was good, but somewhat misleading.\n-\"In the Shower\" Mac and Cheese - gourmet mac and cheese with lobster meat in it. I'm sure it's all fantastic quality ingredients, but $18 for a small plate seemed steep.\n-Ahi tacos as mentioned\n\nAnd on to the good:\n-Duck Confit - little baby spring rolls with duck meat. Delicious.\n-Fried chickpeas - the best value on the menu at $3\n-Flatiron steak with chimichurri - deliciously prepared, though we had a lot of extra chimichurri\n-Lemon basil risotto - excellent, though slightly overpriced for the amount\n-Brie flambee - nice little flatbread with honey and bacon. The combination of the ingredients made it sort of breakfasty, but still delicious.\n\nAnd finally, one of the best things I ever ate: the steak tartare. It was fantastic. I had only had tartare one other time, and after you get used to the whole, erm, concept, it was truly wonderful. The flavors melded really well together and the dish made our night. For dessert I had a pistachio meringue with chai ice cream. The meringue was extremely sweet but the ice cream was the right sweetness for such a meal.\n\nHappy hour for $5 wells and $6 glasses of wine.

With 6 or more you could just do the \"eat the menu\" option, but with 2 we each got to have a couple bites of each thing.

The food, of course, was delicious and fairly inexpensive for it being LV (partially because we didn't eat any land mammals on this visit). For you vegetarians, Keller has thoughtfully denoted a section of the small plates menu as being \"vegetarian\", saving you the guesswork of what actually has animal products in it. In addition, if you are on a budget but want the Fleur dining experience, vegetarian is the way to go as the items generally ranged from $3-11. \n\nIn any event, we went with:\n\n- Fried chickpeas: I'm tempted to whip out my Le Creuset dutch oven now and fry my own little chickpea bites of deliciousness now. They were surprisingly delicious when lightly accented with the lemon wedge accompanying it. \n\n- Heirloom tomato gazpacho: Generally speaking, I'm not a gazpacho person. However, if anyone could change my mind about gazpacho, it is Keller! This delightfully fresh gazpacho was poured at the table over finely chopped honeydew and cantaloupe \"tartare\" and topped with watermelon pop rocks! The pop rocks actually retained their crunchy pop even after it had been sitting in the gazpacho for a few minutes. \n\n- Fingerling potato puree: This is not your mama's mashed potatoes. It was super fluffy and creamy with no lumps. Each bite just melts in your mouth because it was perfectly pureed.  The truffle jus was a nice touch as well without being overwhelming. Sometimes, truffles in food can be really \"in your face\" and this was just the perfect blend of savory earthiness for the potato puree. \n\n- Garlic fries: I have had my fair share of garlic fries in my days and this is definitely one of the better ones I've tried. This one didn't have raw garlic (which can be way too strong) but had a nice roasted garlic flavor to it that infused every bite with garlic but was just balanced enough to leave you wanting more. This is served with ketchup and mayo. \n\n- Salmon with horseradish dill cream: This is served medium and was cooked well to the perfect tenderness. There was just a little seasoning on the salmon, but not too much to where it masks the flavor of the salmon. The cream sauce was a nice contrast to the salmon too but I didn't love the cucumber or the mixed greens that came with it. They made for nice decoration but didn't add anything to the dish. \n\n- Souffle: This takes 30 minutes to make and I highly recommend it. I'm also not a souffl\u00e9 person, but this one is very fluffy and served with cr\u00e8me anglaise tableside, along with a scoop of ice cream (forgot the flavor). The souffl\u00e9 had just the right amount of liquor added to it so you don't feel like you are taking a straight shot of alcohol. It was only the size of the small ramekin, which is a pity because after a few bites each, it was over. I probably would get one per person!\n\nWe didn't get the affogato but it was quite the spectacular presentation at the other tables. It is Bailey's with liquid nitrogen, which they whip up tableside. It turns into \"ice cream\", which is topped with espresso.

His growing legion of Top Chef fans who expect all of the French flavors but none of the pretentious French snootiness that accompanies such fame?

Since I was very hungry, I ordered \"slow cooked salmon\" from the \"large plate\" section of the menu.

That should fill me up.\" So I ordered \"Brownie Lollipop.\" When that arrived I couldn't believe it either. Four little lollipops... and nothing to do with Brownie really, mostly mousse.

When we tried to make a reservation, we realized the situation and decided to eat there anyway. We ate at Fleur on 03/02/11 with a group of nine and ordered THE MENU, which at that time was $415. It was AWESOME. We were served 37 small plates (including the seven desserts) - they told us that it feeds 6-8, but we all nine left full. It does NOT include the large plates or Indulge menu items, however the 37 dishes were all amazing and I was okay in missing out on those pricier dishes. \n\nOf course we had some drinks as well.

Of course we all came here after a full day of drinking/partying at Encore Beach so we were a bit hungover. Upon getting seated, we promptly asked for water and bread (to soak up the alcohol), but the waitress told me that they charged for bread which kind of put me in shock. Now, this isn't the cheap Asian in me coming out and not wanting to pay for it...but it was merely the principle of a fine dining establishment charging for bread.

I'm sorry, but that was just kind of left a bad taste in my mouth about this restaurant. \n\nAnyway, moving along to the food I can honestly say I only loved two of the items from my whole meal (seared foie gras & creme brulee). The seared foie gras was amazing and I enjoyed the pineapple pairing it had with it, however, I wasnt a huge fan of the shitake mushrooms. It was no biggie since I just pushed that aside and only devoured the foie gras and pineapple bits. I also had the croque monsieur, which upon the first few bites was good but got tiring really fast. I also had the ceviche and duck confit which were both delicious, but nothing that blew me away. My friends all ordered different things on the menu and no one loved what they got. The only dish that we all had a consensus of truly enjoying was the seared foie gras. One friend got the bone-in ribeye and was so unimpressed she only ate half of it. She said it was comparable to her mom's home cooked steak, and although her mom is a good cook, I would expect more from a fine dining establishment. My second favorite dish of my meal was the creme brulee. It came out on a long thin rectangular plate, which made for the perfect custard base and burnt caramel ratio. The birthday girl got the Grand Mariner Souffle which was also delicious, but I have had better before like at Le Papilion.\n\nAll in all, I would probably try to find a better place in Vegas if you want a mind blowing dining experience.

I dipped each bite of the steak in the potato puree to get both tastes in one bite. Probably the best decision I made during my entire 5-day stay in Las Vegas. The food is too good to pass up. If you're inside Fleur, make sure to order these two items and eat them together.\n\nThe decor inside Fleur is gorgeous, the ambiance is one of a kind and of course, the wait staff is 5-star.

So, everything is smaller? \n-Also, turns out, the menu is divided into Italian, Spanish, Japanese, American and maybe one more country.

It was a small tapas size but the entire dish was too salty.\n\nHits:\n- the souffle was probably the most ordered dessert at the restaurant. It was delicious. The chocolate flavored dessert also comes with a beautiful scoop of pistachio ice cream. We also paired it with a two-scoop ice cream combo. We got MORE pistachio and blood orange. They both work with chocolate. \n-The seafood was delicious! From the yellowtail sashimi, the oysters over a bed of marbles and dry ice to the perfectly seared scallops. Wish they were entree sizes because I wanted more!\n- the wait staff was quite attentive asking how everything was and if we wanted more of this or that\n-the bread with the basic olive oil and balsamic blend was delicious.

I selected this drink because I like to eat apples, and I thought, why not. This drink is light and sweet, and has a hint of licorice.

Perfectly seared, and cooked to a nice medium rare, easily cut with a fork and knife. Melt in your mouth texture. Perfectly seasoned, enjoyable by itself. The added touches of the shallot sauce and pico de gallo really add a serious amount of flavor to the steak. The shallot sauce, while discernible from the savory steak, does not overpower the steak. Both complement each other and offer a new experience. The pico de gallo also is a nice touch - for me, it seemed to cleanse my taste buds, getting ready for the next bite. \n\n==Sides==\nI also ordered asparagus and polenta to share with my officemates - both were enjoyed with great satisfaction. Actually, that is the first time I had polenta - I think I need to start experimenting more with polenta in my personal pursuits. It was pretty tasty. \n\n==Service==\nService was top notch, our waiter kept our waters filled, made recommendations of tea for desserts, even told us some of the ingredients in dishes that weren't listed on the menu. Nice touch! Even told us how long it takes to prepare dessert, given certain time constraints. Our waiter was attentive and perceptive, bravo sir. \n\n==Conclusion==\nI wouldn't mind eating here again if I was in the area, in fact, I'll make a point of it to visit this restaurant at least once the next time I'm in the Mandalay Bay. For the experience of great food, great service, and relaxing atmosphere, stop by Fleur and have a meal. \n\n==Note==\nWe came here on a Monday evening, when it was hardly busy - I doubt that I could ever walk in here again at a random interval, given all the other times I've passed here, it's always jammed packed.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 4, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "Fleur was amazing dining.

We get several small plates for the meal.  They have \"entree\" dishes too, but still get a small plate.  The smoked scallops seem to be a big hit, served in a dome.  Braised short ribs rock, meatballs, polenta - it's all good.  Kat is the nicest, informative server ever, we always request her.  Drinks are really good here too, blood orange drink has a cayenne kick!

Thankfully, there was seating at the bar, so I decided to eat there.\n\nI ordered a Ginger Ale and their specialty recommended Lamb Burger with fries.\n\nAfter finishing the Ginger Ale, the bartender notified me that refills cost the full amount. I'm sorry, you said what? The glass was literally a 4 ounce after ice was filled to the top and you expect me to pay $4.50 for another soda? No thanks, water it is.\n\nThe main course was good, but nothing that really made my taste buds excited. The burger was a little overcooked for a Medium Rare, and the fries were obviously frozen  (note: I've had these exact same fries at none other than TASTY GARDEN IN SAN GABRIEL VALLEY). When I saw them I was shocked. I expect it out of a HK style diner, not from a 4 star vegas restaurant with a renown chef like Keller himself.\n\nI decided to give my try at the desert and had the Pineapple Panna Cotta. The textures were just right, and the smooth creaminess of the Panna Cotta really showed. It was an excellent overall dessert but unfortunately dampened by the poor meal overall.\n\nConsidering my bill was over $50 for just these three items, I highly doubt I'd ever come back here again, but it was worth trying.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "All the food here was good.

I said that I didn't like exotic meats such as lamb or deer, and the chef said it wasn't a problem since they don't have those meats in the kitchen anyway.  As a fine dining restaurant, I'd expect them to have a fancier selection.\n\nDisappointment #2: \nBecause you don't really get to choose your food, I ended up getting items that I probably wouldn't have ordered normally...aka foods that didn't tickle my fancy.  This included bland, boiled kale and veggies in a liquid soup which got soggy after sitting a while, a HUGE bowl of weird mushrooms that had a funny smell and taste, and a salad with an almost poached, almost raw egg on it.  I probably only ate a few pieces of each, and felt bad wasting the rest :(.  Also, because I didn't know what was coming out next, my stomach wasn't prepared.  I was pretty much full after course #3.\n\nMy meal:\n\nCourse 0.5: Raw oyster in a ponzu sauce under a bed of dry ice\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4HutLYpRMjzohTNZoi9M2Q#4HutLYpRMjzohTNZoi9M2Q\nRefreshing, delicious, and extra presentation points for keeping it on the dry ice!\n\nCourse 1: Potato soup, Asian slaw, crab cake\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4HutLYpRMjzohTNZoi9M2Q#qcCyMQR7R2nrb58NFsljeg\nProbably my favorite course.  The potato soup was SO rich and creamy and was made with a touch of truffle oil.  The slaw wasn't anything special, but a good refreshing counter to its adjacent rich foods.  The crab cake was also awesome: crispy on the outside, soft and flaky on the inside, with tons of REAL crab meat.  I could have had another couple plates of just the soup and crab cake for the meal and would be so happy!\n\nCourse 2: Spinach salad with poached(?) egg\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4HutLYpRMjzohTNZoi9M2Q#3kO-o6Wh-VqFsD27b-Fcsw\nThe spinach and its dressing was actually very good with a light, sweet, creamy dressing that didn't overpower the hearty greens.  However, I absolutely despise runny egg yolks, so I had to make sure I didn't pop the egg while eating my greens.  When I was almost done with the salad, it broke on its own and I was done with the dish right then.\n\nCourse 3: Surf and turf: salmon and steak\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4HutLYpRMjzohTNZoi9M2Q#w9BBWD7c8mABIw_fKFQE0A\nPredictable flavors, but still good.  Both the salmon and the steak were very tender and moist.  My only complaint here was there was no starch to pair it with!  I ended up ordering a loaf of bread, since they apparently don't sell rice.\n\nCourse 4: Braised beef with espresso foam, side mushrooms and boiled kale/veggies\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4HutLYpRMjzohTNZoi9M2Q#HBd3RqXWlXF4ipHeEmbJ4w\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4HutLYpRMjzohTNZoi9M2Q#VOytnJ-DKBLtAnOk38JACw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4HutLYpRMjzohTNZoi9M2Q#oNaHfByaNlevg5X0ANoRWA\nThis was the \"weird mushrooms\" and \"bland boiled kale/veggies\" that I mentioned above.  I was pretty much full after course #3, so I couldn't really enjoy this dish to its fullest, but the braised beef was one of my favorite things of the night!  Sooo tender, flavorful, and the espresso foam gave it that extra somethin' somethin'!  It sat on a bed of mashed potatoes (FINALLY!!!! STARCH!!!!).  Even though I was full, I ate most of the beef and potatoes...\n\nCourse 5: Chocolate cream puffs and pineapple/cream parfait\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4HutLYpRMjzohTNZoi9M2Q#WCpWBn9nyeCThEWB34B9Hw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4HutLYpRMjzohTNZoi9M2Q#zUTa5KNekhL0lU_s92EugA\nSo by now, I was over and beyond STUFFED.  Not really much of a dessert person, I let myself relish one chocolate cream puff, which was actually pretty good.  The chocolate was rich and decadent, poured over the puff dough, and between the two puff halves was vanilla bean gelato!  Yum!\n\nI must admit, it was a very tasty meal.

I was really rooting for him the first season to win! I also have always wanted to eat at his restaurant in SF at Fleur des Lys so when I found out he had Fleur in Mandalay Bay, I quickly made a RSVP before the show.\n\nThe restaurant was quite empty when we arrived, given that my RSVP was at 5:30 bc we had the 7:00 tickets to the MJ show, and we got sat down inside very quickly. It was super dark inside that we had to request moving to different tables bc it was too dark for some people to read the menu. Our waiter was nice, attentive, good at recommendations and any questions we had.\n\nHalf ordered the MJ prix fixe menu while half ordered a bunch of little dishes to share. Some things ordered was the shrimp ceviche, ahi tacos, beef sliders, skirt steak, Caesar salad, corn soup, and Fleur burger. \n\nEverything tasted pretty mediocre. I was slightly disappointed especially since I had high expectations of this place and also that I had told my party that dinner would be good. Majority of my party was not satisfied with their meal and was highly disappointed as well. The sliders were okay. Good meat patties but kinda dry and needed some sort of sauce to it to counteract the dryness. The shrimp ceviche should really NOT be called ceviche. Normally, a ceviche is cooked in the juices of some sort of citrus juice like lemon or lime but this \"ceviche\" was basically drowned in a cold cucumber soup. The cucumber dressing was really bland and had no flavor to it and the accompaniments was really minimal. Couldn't find a single tomato or avocado in that small dish. The ahi tacos were good. Good slab of tuna but could have used more sauce in the tiny tiny taco. Salad was mediocre and corn was okay. Nothing too spectacular just ok. We ended the night with some brownie pops which again, kinda misleading. I was expecting kind of like a brownie cake pop but it's more like a chocolate truffle on a stick with some caramel. It was way too sweet even for a sweet tooth lover like me.\n\nOverall, my dinner was fine. But for a highly rated restaurant, I was expecting more especially one that's owned by Hubert Keller.

My husband and I arrived on a Friday night just before 7pm.  We did not have reservations and we were seated immediately.  The restaurant has a nice relaxed vibe and the servers were very attentive.  We were presented with a tablet so that we could browse through the list of cocktails and wines, which is something I very much liked as you have the opportunity to search for wines you might like by selecting the flavor profiles you enjoy.\n\nIn terms of the food, I would say we were 50% impressed and 50% underwhelmed.  We ordered the following:\n\n*  Ahi Tuna Tacos\n*  Fried Mac and Cheese w/ Truffle Oil Peas and Ham\n*  Braised Short Ribs\n*  Fleur Burger - Wagyu Beef on a Brioche Bun\n*  Chocolate Mousse\n\nThe Ahi Tuna Tacos were maybe about two and a half inches (3 total) and served on a crunchy shell.  The problem I found with this was that the shells were not crunchy enough.  I'm guessing that they had gotten a bit soggy when the cold tuna was placed in the shell.

(I love Cajun food, so I would have liked a bit more spice, but I think most people would thoroughly enjoy this item as it is.)\n\nBraised Short Ribs - The absolute BEST part of the meal.  The short ribs were extremely tender and were served with mashed fingerling potatoes.  \n\nMy husband ordered the Fleur Burger and he was really excited for it, but he ended up describing it as \"Meh.\"  He said that it was cooked very well and it was very juicy, but he said it lacked any real flavor.  - It was served with a side of alfalfa sprouts, ketchup, and some sort of other dark sauce.  I took a bit and thought that it was indeed juicy, but it was kind of boring.  \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the Chocolate Souffle, which was served with a side of cherry sauce/glaze that was poured over/into the souffle as well as a side of pistachio ice cream.  - I was completely overwhelmed with the dessert.

Surprisingly, getting a table on a Saturday night was no problem at all. Then again, I've rarely had any problems getting a reservation on any restaurant at the Las Vegas trip from the numerous times I've gone. \n\nMy group of friends and I took a cab from Treasure Island, where we were staying and traveled to Mandalay Bay. This also was my first time going to this part of the strip since I normally stay in the Bellagio to Wynn part of the strip. The hotel was nothing surprising, just your typical casino with heavy foot traffic being it a Saturday night.\n\nWe then made it to the restaurant, 8:30 pm on a Saturday night. One word to describe it - Dead! I was amazed that for a restaurant owned by a famous Chef, no one was eating there. Call me easily swayed, but normally, it's a cardinal rule in my book when selecting a place to eat.  \"Only eat in a restaurant that's packed - meaning, they have great food, ascertained by its patrons\" Take note though, I'm from San Francisco so I was basing my take on this to Fleur De Lys, another Hubert Keller restaurant. \n\nAmbiance:\n\nWe got sat down, although the place is nice and the d\u00e9cor was \"modernesque artsy\", with high ceilings, I didn't like how the restaurant had a feel of being open. It's hard to describe because when I like the ambiance of a restaurant, I like a feel of warmth. The place being opened took some points away In my book. The Ipad on the table where you can order a drink and dessert was both an eye catcher and an eyesore, being a big bulk in the middle of our table.\n\nFood:\n\nThe items we got included. Foie Gras, Osso Bucco, Mac and Cheese, Sliders, Clam Noodle and their Burger. \n\nThe Foie, as expeted was decadent. It was soft, silky and was just heavenly. Having not eaten this for almost a year, since California made it illegal for Duck liver being sold and served at restaurants. \n\nThe Osso Bucco was good too. It came with 2 medium size shanks, which were soft, luscious and bursting with flavor. What really is the star of this entre dish is the Pollenta that comes with it. The side dish comes in a VERY petite sauceresque dish. Let me just tell you, I can eat a Big BOWL of that. It tasted truffley, earthy, cheesy and just cest magnifique! A suggestion and tip for Fleur, Make a bowl of this polenta with some beef flakes on top - it be a big hit! It would be an easy $30 entr\u00e9e there.\n\nThe Mac and Cheese, The burger, and the sliders were typical with no surprises. Underwhelming for a good rated restaurant.\n\nService:\nThe waiters were on top of their game, always asking if we needed anything. They filled up our water glasses without being asked, and simply was just excellent. The greeter on the podium who was towering tall seemed to be aloof and was not engaged. We didn't have to deal with her that much, so I didn't care for her.\n\nOur dinner ended with the serving giving a small complimentary dessert plate. It came with 2 cake pops with a slight bed of nuts and berries. Again, okay but nothing WOW.

Whatever the drama was, it was impeding on my order getting taken, so I was far more pissed than entertained. By the time my server finally appeared at the table, I was about ready to just leave and go hungry until dinner. Thankfully, he showed up right before the final straw came down.\n\nThe next star reducing event was being told that the two sandwiches my mother and I wanted were BOTH sold out. WTF!? I asked the waiter how that was possible when there was still 2 hours left in the lunch service, and he explained it was very difficult for the kitchen to predict the kind of traffic the restaurant would see at lunch. He made a pretty decent case, but it just minimally reduced my frustration. Perhaps had he been a little more attentive when my mother and I first arrived, I would have let the mishap slide a bit more easily.\n\nWe ended up ordering the pork belly flatbread and the hot dog. I can't say either was bad, but neither were they memorable. They both go into the \"Ate to Live\" category. Nothing special or noteworthy.

The last dish I had mixed feelings about was the octopus. Since this was the first time I had octopus I think I need to have it one more time before I decide if I really like octopus or not. Overall this was a very fun experience going through these 10 dishes and deciding what you like. Next time I think I'd pick what looks good to me instead of going the mini tour route though. I debated  between the 3 or 4 stars, in the end since the food was 50/50, I went with the 4 stars because if I had ordered my own food it may have even been good enough to earn 5 stars, service goes a long way.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Just had cocktails here.

Bar seating flanks the outside of the restaurant, with the sort of chairs that are nearly impossible to push in unless you do some kind of weird half seated tiptoe thing, In a bar where people may choose to stand, they make sense, here in a restaurant, they don't. My place setting was missing a fork, which is inexcusable at this price point. Drink orders were completely bizarre, involving picking out my selection on an iPad, which I then had to turn around and show to the server to actually place my order. Why can't I just send the order to the bar directly from the app? This actually takes more time than a normal cocktail list. It would make sense for wine where you want to be sure your selection is communicated clearly, but it doesn't work at all here.\n\nIt also doesn't help that, for as beautiful as the interior is, you're still sitting in a casino and there's some dude at the bar outside whose idea of Vegas is Vince Vaughn movies from the 90's and all the shouting that goes along with it.\n\nThere are a few good points here, but they're hard to pick out in an otherwise bizarre experience.

The potatoes -- soaked, not a singly potato-y thing left about them.  Not a jus-free spot remaining on anything edible.  \nThe szechuan beef tartare was truly horrible.  The first time I had tartare where I was strikingly aware I was eating raw beef.  It had no other flavor, despite being mixed tableside with spices by the expeditor.  We were asked how spicy we wanted it, we said very, so he added a ton and it still tasted of nothing but raw beef.  \nThe duroc pork belly lo mein had entirely too much lo mein, was too sweet, too salty, too fatty, too saucy, too everything while still not tasting of anything decent!  Just one big goop with no distinguishing flavors or textures.  \nThe drink-ordering system is just strange and inefficient.  You pick your drinks out on an iPad, but instead of zooming it off to the bartender like you assume it does, your server eventually comes and picks it up and puts it into the computer... so you think you ordered your drink 10 minutes ago, but you actually haven't until they come to take your order for them anyway.  \n\nThe menu items are incohesive.

For lighter and refreshing options there is the \"Cucumber Collins\" and \"Cu-liad\" both made with square one organic cucumber vodka and freshly squeezed lemon juice.

Hmm, must check it out,\" I thought.\n\nNot so fast...\n\nWhat I suspect we have here is a lot of the owner's friends creating 5-star reviews to bring in curious Yelpers like me.  (You can tell because they're very \"promo-ey\" and not so critical/constructive).\n\nLet me give you the real deal, at this stage of the game.\n\n* They're still 4 weeks away from a liquor license, thus no adult beverages to go with your tapas (unless you BYOB, which everyone around us did -apparently they got the memo). We could have used some of that awesome sangria from you-know-where.\n* Seemed like they're suffering the same ethos that plagues many mom & pop restos -lots of friends and family hovering and trafficking in and out of the kitchen, like its an extension of their home kitchen. Kids running through the restaurant. Felt like we were imposing on a personal space, yet, we're paying customers. Awkward. \n* Had to request silverware, after the first appy arrived. We sat there looking at it, at each other, at it, scoured the surrounding tables to see if we could borrow a set, but nope. Eventually we flagged the hostess (co-owner)  who then brought a set. Then another set arrived a few minutes later from the server. A bit uncoordinated. \n* The water is unfiltered, so it was truly tap water from the best the Vegas pipes have to offer. Tastes terrible. \n* Dining partner had the muddled mint and strawberry lemonade. Tall thin glasses at $3.50 a pop. WIth ice, of course, so you'll be going through your drinks pretty darn quickly. My brother went through about six refills (which you do pay for). The hostess was nice and comped him one, I think because she knows that's a steep price for a tiny bit of actual beverage. \n* Cheese plate. $11 for tiny morsels of forgettable cheese! There was about $2 worth of cheese on the plate. Retitled, \"Rip me Off Please Cheese Plate.\"\n* Chicharrones. My brother is a chicharrones aficionado (he guiltily admits). He took one bite and didn't touch the rest of it. His assessment, \"No. Just, no.\"\n* Bucket of tempura veggies: edible along with the calamari. Hard to mess these up, but the calamari was comprised of super tiny rings. Lots of breading, not lots of calamari. Just kind of bummed at this point...\n* Lastly, bro ordered the cookie baked in a mini skillet for dessert. It arrives, with a plastic spoon. Odd. I watch him fight to get the tiny plastic spoon through rock hard ice cream while also trying not to let the spoon melt when touching the scalding hot cast iron skillet. Humorous to watch, yet, ridiculous. I flag down the server, ask for a metal spoon. He looks at my bro and asks, \"What's wrong with that spoon?\" \"I can't eat the ice cream with it -its frozen solid.\"  So what he brings us isa huge serving spoon meant for back of house. Jolly Green Gian spoon. \nWhatever. My good nature is on its last tempura crumb at this point.\n* Asked for the check. Took 20 minutes... After check was paid (with hostess), we had the receipt with a large stack of bills sitting on the table. Server flys by and scoops up the stack of bills ($50).  \"Whoa, cowboy, that's our change.\" Again, uncoordinated -I think they don't know who's doing what there, just yet. Server looked pretty young so maybe his first job while still in HS? Friend of the family, I'll bet... \n\nI keep saying to myself, ok, they're new. But lots of this stuff has nothing to do with new.

The food is creative and the kitchen sends out dishes plated in imaginative designs on the plate.  Between the plating of the food and the inventive flavor combinations, Nosh & Swig is a place where you're encouraged to play with your food.\n\nWe ordered a few meat plates and each was expertly-prepared, creatively plated, and fun.  The Nachos O'Brien consists of peppered pork on potato chips with stewed tomatoes in a creamy bechamel cheese sauce.  The flavors of the meat and cheese sauce were surprisingly well-balanced.  The potato chips were prepared by the kitchen and the fried flavor might have been too strong, but the peppered pork stands strong and the cheese sauce blends the whole dish.  The kitchen also did a great job with the short ribs plate--the ribs were glazed with Dr. Pepper.  The glaze was sweet and thick on the expertly-prepared, tender beef, which is served on amazingly sweet, crisp polenta cornbread and candied carrots.  The candied carrots were a bit much, but everything else was brilliant.\n\nThe non-meat dishes were similarly imaginative.  The salmon skewers came cleverly prepared in a miso sweet glaze, making the fish taste almost honeyed.  The kitchen added a fresh seaweed salad that was an excellent compliment to the dish.  \n\nOur favorite dish on the menu was the Elote plate--corn covered in a sauce of garlic butter, cayenne and cilantro.  Wonderful combination--creamy and tart.  The dish is messy, but who cares.  The sauce mixes exceptionally well with the fresh corn underneath. \n\nMeasuring the plates on their own, I think I'd only re-order the Elote, but that doesn't mean I didn't love Nosh & Swig.  The other three dishes we had were clever and fun to experience.  So much that I want to head back and try several more dishes.\n\nNote on the newer-status of the restaurant: Right now, the restaurant seems a little awkward.  The space is designed to be sleek and cosmopolitan--metal tables and comfy booths with small bookcases on the wall including books and busts.  They're not filling up the restaurant yet, so the space feels a little empty, but its more than compensated for by a staff that's working hard to make sure the customers are satisfied.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 6, "cool": 4}}, {"text": "I dig Nosh & Swig.

Not on the menu, but if you are lucky it just might be a Chef Special that day. \n\nPretzel Brat $8- You REALLY need to order these. Chicken sausage, sauerkraut, cheese gravy on pretzel roll. I cannot begin to tell you how much I enjoyed this and I don't usually get down on kraut. Everything works with this and it came on two separate rolls which was perfect for sharing.\n\nMonte Cristo $7- ORDER THIS. My favorite dish here. The mellow melted goodness of the Gruyere complimented the smokiness of the Black Forest ham. But it doesn't end there. It's then topped with a perfectly fried egg and warm berry compote. Hot damn I loved this. \n\nTruffled Tots- ORDER THESE The best tater tots I have ever tasted. They were creamy, yet crisp on the outside and topped with shredded cheese. Every bite tasted of truffle and made me wish my friend I was dining with was allergic to potato so I could eat every single one of them. No such luck. We both battled it out for the last tater. You won't be disappointed with these and if you are well we probably wouldn't be friends anyways and your mutha's a whore.\n\nCock-A-Waffle-Doo $10- This was good, real good in fact. My only problem and it's a total personal one because I'm not perfect is it was dark meat. I don't enjoy dark meat chicken, yet it was crispy, flavorful and worked well with the sweet Belgium waffle and Berry Maple reduction. P.S. I could drink the reduction all by itself. \n\nSpicy Edamame $2- Small portion, but not short in flavor. GET THIS, TOO. We destroyed this and loved the sauce so much we were dipping the tots in it. \n\nSWIG- I slurped up the Chata-Effup which was a-okay. I am still excited for them to get their liquor license because I know they will have some crazy good cocktails.\n\nPrices are cheap for the creative delicious dishes this place is bangin' out.

This was the reason why I came here!  Well, besides the Yelp meet anyways lol.  I had very high expectations, and it did not disappoint!  The meat is super tender, almost like pot roast, and pulled apart very easily with a fork.  The cornbread underneath was a very cool combination!  The only dish I considered ordering more than one, and every time I come here, it will be on my table!\n\n2)  Monte Cristo!  Never had one of these before.. It was very yummy, with a fried over easy egg on top....a complete breakfast in a sandwich!  I will order this one again!\n\n3)  PB&J was excellent.  Imagine a fried PB&J...it tastes even better than that lol.  This was one of the best dishes of the night...I will order this again.\n\n4)We ordered the truffle tots by themselves...can't say how much it was, but it was cheaper than getting the whole sampler.  The tots are very salty, but still good in my eyes.  You can taste the truffle oil, but the cheese + salt was a little too salty.  I would still probably order these again.\n\n5)  Dragon claws were cool.  It tastes like sushi wrapped into a jalapeno lol.  Fish tasted fresh and the whole combo works well.  Not sure if I will order again though.\n\n6)  Pretzel bratz with chicken sausage was cool.  They were like sliders with pretzel bread.  I was soo full at this point, but it was a nice dish to order.  I might order it again.\n\n7)  Smokey Poke was good.  The fish was nice and tender, tasted like sushi quality, but there was so much ponzu on there.  I really enjoy sushi, so you will probably like it....I just am used to enjoying the fish for themselves without being covered up.  I'd probably skip this one next time.\n\n8)  Fondue cheese itself was great.....The sides were not so much.  One of the sides looked like hamburger bread lol.  Most of the others were too big or two long, so you had to cut them all in half or more.  The skewer sticks didn't do the job well, so we ate it all with the fork.  I wouldn't order it again.\n\n9)  We tried the creme cheese lote too...didn't do much for me at all.  Barely tasted the creme cheese...it was pretty bland IMO and not an adjective I would use for a desirable dessert.

The decor of the restaurant is kind of minimalist, with an open kitchen layout (but you will have to be seated at the counter right next to the kitchen to see the actions, otherwise you will only see the staff's heads as they go about their work).\n\nI was able to sample a decent portion of the menu, as the best part of having tapas are sharing it with your newest friends.  The Monte Cristo (which others have recommended in their Yelp reviews) was great. The jam was the secret ingredient that made the dish over the top for me.  The Dragon Claws was delicious without packing too much fiery capsaicin power.  The Korean BBQ Wings, was good, but way too salty and really spicy for me. But the kimchi was good. Maybe I just needed some rice with that.  Food, overall was above average, but the best part about Nosh & Swig's menu is what they are not offering from the other OG tapas restaurant.\n\nService was admirably decent for handling huge parties, that were all clamoring (okay, maybe without the loud voices, the negative pushyness and protest signs) for the waitstaff's attention.  They were all very friendly and aside from a hiccup from here and there, the evening was fun.\n\nSolid \"A-OK\", but I had a lot of fun meeting new people that I am bumping it up to Yay!

Went here for the first time as part of Molly T's UYE\n\nAlright a little about me: My mom always told me that when ever we go to a buffet or a restaurant, look at the price of the item or the cost of the buffet and try to eat that much worth of food. \n\nWith this programmed into me at a young age it's often hard to steer away from this mentality. Anthony M can vouch for this as he seems to believe i am capable of devouring everything in front of me at an alarming pace. So yeah with all this said, I do admit that i generally do not like tapas places because the portion sizes are way smaller then they need to be at entree prices. \n\nI do fully agree with Anthony M that Nosh & Swig deserves some extra kudos points for not being the cookie cutter run of the mill 'oh look bacon wrapped dates...oh joy bacon wrapped shrimp...' tapas places. Not that there's anything wrong with bacon wrapped dates and bacon wrapped anything. Just saying that after watching nothing but action movies where everything EVERYTHING has to in some way shape or form explode it's nice to break it up with a romantic comedy or two. Just sayin. That and before i get anymore complements it's Anthony M that pointed this out to me so the idea is not original i'm just agreeing with what he told me in person seeing as he hasn't written his review yet.\n\nSo i ordered the chicken and waffles because the Urban in me likes chicken and waffles. The price was decent (10 bucks). What came out was a standard sized waffle that wasnt too crispy but had a decent texture. The chicken was a de-boned thigh that was butterflied and stretched out to cover the waffle. Sauce provided was a blueberry reduction syrup like thing. A nice gourmet spin on an otherwise dangerously unhealthy comfort food. \n\nOverall my favorite were the dr pepper braised short ribs, nice flavor that wasnt too overpowering and very VERY tender. \n\nSeeing as i dont live on the east side, nor the north side, safe to say no where near the north east side; i just dont see myself going outta my way to go back to Nosh & Swing unless it's another UYE hosted by someone i know.\n\nWould i recommend this place to people that do live in the area. Yes, yes i would as they're doing something new in the tapas scene. Hopefully next time i go back they'll have their liquor license and we can have some cocktails along with our finger food.\n\n\n\nYelp 100 - 004 of 100", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 6, "cool": 5}}, {"text": "I love tapas. And I love little locally owned eateries. So when Jaime W. invited me to Molly's UYE at Nosh & Swig, I was super excited to check out this new place.\n\nNosh & Swig offers up delish little plates of unique and interesting foods served up by warm and friendly employees. When we were there it was only Nosh, no Swig, but the owners were gracious enough to allow customers to BYOB. \n\nLocated in one of the numerous, plain-jane strip malls around town, Nosh & Swig is one of those places you may just drive on by if you aren't looking for it. Inside, the area is split in half, with cozy booths and movable tables to sit at.  I personally enjoyed the classic hiphop playing in the background, it made for some great conversation at our table. \n\nI sat with Jaime, Candice and my husband, and we all ordered our own dishes but shared the majority of them.  Nosh & Swig is a little pricey for the serving sizes, particularly the drinks. I had a thai tea with boba ($3.50) but the cup was so small and there was so much ice, I only tasted 2 pieces of boba (my husband got a fantastic cup of french press coffee for $1.50 though). \n\nI started with one of the daily specials, a fruit gazpacho (Do not recall the price). It was light, cool and refreshing... and served up beautifully in a martini dish with a shaved melon flower as a garnish. \n\nI had a taste of the Pretzel Brats ($8) and was blown away, I had no idea that chicken sausage could taste so good!  The tiger cry ($9) was another standout. But my absolute favorite was the brie dawg ($6.50) which tasted as good as it smelled. \n\nUs ladies shared the Uni-cones ($6) for dessert, one of the owner served it to us and made sure things were tasty and service was ok. I personally thought everything was on point, even the slightly high prices weren't ridiculously high and besides... I'd rather pay a higher price to help a new locally owned business succeed then be a cheep ass and watch it fail! \n\nIf you enjoy noshing and want to try something different then what you see at the  usual tapas joints, giver Nosh & Swig a try.

It's okay, the pictures make for an acceptable distraction.\n\nOverall Nosh & Swig has a lot of decent dishes, and a few really good ones.  As of mid-January they really should have just been called Nosh since they didn't have their liquor license yet.

It wasn't until we asked the girl at the hostess stand if we had to sit ourselves, which was odd since there was only one other table sitting inside the restaurant around 6pm with more than five people on the floor. From that moment on, we had this weird vibe about the place knowing that the staff wasn't sure what they were doing, or had any knowledge when it comes to any type of customer service.\n\nNext, let's talk about food. This place offers a variety of things and I like that. I mean, it's kind of what you would expect at a tapas restaurant, right? Reviewed the pictures on Yelp to double check what we wanted and decided to go with these:\n\nCock-A-Waffle: We honestly lowered our expectations since we're jaded with this famous concept from Roscoe's in Los Angeles but honestly, it was bland, dry and flaky. The fried chicken? Kind of similar to the fried chicken packs you could find in the deli section at Food-4-Less. The waffles? It was hard and tough. I had to drizzle my maple syrup all over the plate to soften it up a little then finally decided to call that my dessert.\n\nElote: On the menu it says that the corn are grilled, which we didn't even taste at all. It tastes as if they were just boiled while hiding that fact with random sauces and garnishes. That would have been ok if they didn't mention that they were grilled on the menu. But seriously, to mess up corn says a lot about a restaurant.\n\nDragon Claws: Their version of a Japanese popper. Probably the best thing that we've had there but doesn't even compare to the ones you'll find at any sushi restaurant.\n\nWe lost hope in this place and didn't remember the names of the last two items that we ordered. One was the bite-sized lasagna dish, served on top of a circular skillet plate and the other was similar to a steak bruschetta. Both were nothing special. Came to this place VERY hungry so you would think we would enjoy any kind of food but it turned out to be the exact opposite. Beverage glasses were thin and narrow so we didn't even get full off of water either and THAT was ok. We just wanted to leave to make up our experience with a better dinner somewhere else.\n\nMaybe I'll give this restaurant another shot next year. Maybe then they'll finally decide to invest in an Aloha System so it doesn't take ten minutes to receive your check and ten minutes to process it (with a card). Maybe their staff will be better trained and knowledgeable about the menu as well so they won't have to disappear every now and then every time we would ask a question about a plate. Or maybe when this place has more than 100 reviews I'll reconsider this place again.

There are smaller booths around the restaurant that seat 2-4. Large tables are available for bigger parties. There are an ample amount of high top bar tables that seat about 3 per table. Where the high top tables and booths are, you can see the open kitchen.

Everything on their menu screams fusion. Can't really put a finger on what they're a fusion of so I'll say that they fuse flavors from all around the world! The menu itself is super adorable. They separate their items by categories: pork, beef, chicken, seafood, veggies, cheese and dessert. Within each category, they have around 7 or 8 dishes to choose from. \n\nEach plate is priced anywhere from $5 to about $12. I took my cousin and we were content after 4 dishes.

Perfect amount of butter. \n- Sticky Bun Tacos: Fried pork belly, pickled cabbage and ginger soy. The pork belly wasn't greasy. I personally think this dish would be better if the pork was shredded. Total of 3 small tacos. \n- Albondigas: Meatballs with salsa roja with sliced jalapenos. Even without the jalapenos, there's a kick of heat in the sauce.\n- Brulee Salmon Skewers. Three pieces of salmon on a stick with a honey miso glaze and a side of warm Japanese cabbage salad. I thought the honey miso glaze tasted a lot like regular teriyaki sauce.\n-Pretzel Brats: 2 mini sandwiches - chicken sausage with cheese gravy and sauerkraut on pretzel bread. This was my fave, hands down. \n- Cremini caps: Mushroom caps filled with asiago cream and caramelized onions. For all you mushroom lovers, this is a very yummy appetizer.

It was full of flavor, and drowning in a smokey, citrus sauce. \n\nDragon Claws: 5 - A jalapeno popper stuffed with cheese and tuna?!?!

Walking in the place was empty, but since it was so early, we cut them some slack. We were seated quickly, in a booth of our choosing. The table was a little wobbly, but ok.

We clearly over ordered, but we were excited to try as many things as we could. The standouts to me were the Nachos O'brien, Chicharron and Elote. Everything was solid, but I would definitely steer away from the sandwiches and sliders next time. The Sticky Bun Tacos were tasty, but the bao wasn't the freshest I have ever had. I quite enjoyed the filling and would definitely order this again. The Chicharron and Elote were spicy and oh so tasty. The addition of tator tots was an interesting flavor added to the chicharron, but it was still really good. I could eat these two dishes all day long. Everything on the menu was really fun and innovative. I enjoyed the play on words and cheeky item names. You've gotta love food with a sense of humor.\n\nOur server was incredibly attentive and came back with refills very regularly. If only their cups and glasses were a larger, more reasonable size, then she probably wouldn't have had to come back and forth with refills quite so often.

Also Vegetarian friendly dishes were indicated with V and color coded green on the menu.   It made it easier figure out and zero in what we wanted to try out.

(Well especially if you plan on ordering 2+ more small plates) \n\nMy favorites: the Monte Cristo, loved the combo of the fried egg, ham with mild flavor of the Gruyere cheese oozing and the touch of sweetness of the berry compote. Also the Cock-A-Waffle Doo! The cornflake crusted fried chicken, meat was moist, had flavor and was juicy. Crust was crunchy and again a touch of sweetness with a berry maple syrup reduction.  I love the fusion of savory and sweet in these dishes! Both \"small\" plates I  I definitely would order again!\n\nThe Baked & Glazed and Teri Chicken also pretty good.  The fussili pasta was cheesy and made the perfect comfort food dish and also vegetarian friendly! The Teri Chicken was grilled and I like the garnish of crunchy won ton strips.\n\nWe made room for dessert and chose the \"cookimon'\" which was a cookie baked right into a mini cast iron pan. So that little sucker was warm and the chocolate chips slightly melted and topped with vanilla ice cream and whip cream.  Kinda reminded me of BJ's Pizookie! The Cream Cheese Lote, which is the version of Thai flatbread was more like a crepe but rolled up. It was spread with cream cheese, rolled up and drizzled with a simple vanilla sugar glaze (Creme Anglaise)\n\nService was great! Our server was really sweet and friendly. She truly liked and believed in the dishes she serves up and shared with us what she had tried out as well. Just a minor issue of check when presented, Groupon discount was indicated on check but not deducted..brought it to attention of our server who corrected it right away. \n\nWe were there during the dead zone hour between lunch and dinner so it wasn't busy much.  Two other parties were just finishing up and a large party was setting up towards the end of our meal.  Our dishes came out paced at the right time, there was no awkward long waits between the dishes . \n\nThe atmos was casual with tunes of the likes of Bob Marley playing in the background.

It had excellent jam underneath.  I absolutely will get this again.\n\nThe short rib has a Dr. Pepper glaze.  This was too sweet, and overpowered the dish.

It didn't look as grand sadly enough.  We only got one waffle cut in half versus those who got 2 waffles.  We had one regular scoop of pink ice cream and a cone whereas others got more ice cream.  And there weren't any marshmallows as other pics showed.

The Husband went home and had some ramen because he was still hungry but wasn't interested in ordering more here.  It was a Sunday evening and there were a handful of other parties there.  A few more did arrive during our visit.  Water glasses were huge and we got a pitcher to refill ourselves, so there was no shortage of liquid available here.\n\nI wish I had come in the beginning stages when they were more generous with their portions.  I think their food lacked consistency from what other diners got.  I understand that it's always different in the beginning and changes are bound to happen, but getting less food shouldn't be one of those changes.\n\nI do love their clean design and font.  I think the menu is pretty clear cut, and the theme is good.

A Groupon was released for it a few months after opening, so I bought it and ate there a couple months later. In short, it seems a place that doesn't know what it is while trying to be everything at once. It's a place where they try their best to be bold and playful and modern all at the same time and it all clashes in a way that is confusing to the palate. Think of all the recent culinary trends...small-plates for sharing, pork belly bao, bold cooking with bacon, clever names, etc...this place tried to do all of it.\n\nFirst, the environment. It's in a pretty run-down strip mall. Once you go in, the space feels cold and uninviting due to the metal on the walls and the metal tables. The items on the menu made no sense being together. They had pork baos (on the menu as pork bun tacos), some asian-inspired chicken wings, ceviche, albondigas (meatballs), fried elote, monte cristo, carne asada sandwich, etc. I had the waitress just bring us her favorites because I had a really difficult time trying to figure out what I wanted.\n\nWe tried two drinks. The \"chata-effup\" (a spiced cinnamon rice drink which is essentially horchata) and the Mint & Basil Lemonade. The lemonade was decent, but the chata-effup was pretty watered down, making it very unsatisfying (imagine a half-milk-half-water blend). The drinks were served in large mason jars. Again, completely unnecessary. Why am I being served my drink in a mason jar? Nothing about Nosh and Swig indicates a reason for mason jars. It's just being done because it's \"cool\".\n\nThe food was okay, but not great. The best thing we had that day was the Cornflake-breaded fried chicken and waffles. The chicken was well-fried and the waffles were decent. The only flaw was that it came with a blueberry sauce which was a lot more watery than I'd like (it just soaks into the waffle and makes it soggy). The other dishes all missed the mark in some form. The pork bao tacos really needed something to brighten up the taste a bit. It was a very flat and muddled in flavor. Same for the ceviche. The ceviche had soy sauce and a few other sauces that made it a very salty dish, yet it was in desperate need for some acid. The monte cristo was completely lacking in any flavor and had way too much bread for what little was inside.  For the poor quality and the small portion sizes, Nosh and Swig is vastly overpriced.\n\nWe skipped dessert because we were pretty disappointed in our meal. In the end, we paid just over $50 for two people (2 drinks, four dishes) and left trying to think up a place to go to dessert to lift our spirits.

We shared the dishes and we both liked the nachos and the Tiger Cry.  The hit of the two was the TIger Cry which is Thai beef jerky with nam prik and some sesame.  There was also a container of sticky rice in a ball in a plastic bag.  I'm sot sure it was sticky rice or rice just twisted together in the plastic to make it stick together.  I expected it might be a bit spicy from the nam prik, but it was not.  However, the nam prik they did use along with the jerky glaze made this a great dish.  The nachos were good, but nothing exceptional.  \n\nMy error was in ordering both pommes frites and truffle tots.  That's a large portion of both in their small pails.

I was stuffed after I had just three plates!\n\nI personally (as a pescatarian) had the smokey poke. Let me tell you, that was some deliciousness on a plate. The poke sits atop several sauces (of which I've forgotten at the moment) and I was encouraged to dip some in each. Whatever. I totally mixed that all together and then inhaled it. I got a little of the smokey, a nice bite of spicy and some mellow flavors that balanced it all out. It was fresh and delicious.\n\nMy second plate was the elote. Listen, I would love to sit here and wax eloquent about how delicious this was, but I'm just going to go ahead and say it: if I could mainline this into my veins I would have OD'd, oh, several MILLION times. There are no words for how great this dish is. I can't even go on, I'm getting emotional about not being able to go get some more right now. And then an hour later, and an hour after that. Hi, I'm Nickolle and I'm an elote addict. CRACK on a cob. That's what they should call it. Try it and come to meetings with me. We'll get through this together. (this is corn on the cob that you grab and eat with your hands - lick your fingers afterward, no one cares)\n\nNext up for me was the lotsa-mozza. This is essentially cheese, polenta, eggplant and tomatoes. But yet so much more. Anyone who has ever taken cheese and melted it in a hot pan knows the delicious taste. That's sort of this, but with sliced mozza and other things in between, specifically, sweet polenta (mmmmm...). The thing that brings this all together is the taste of that melted, crunchy cheese. So, so good. So good.\n\nFor dessert (like, someone stop me, okay?) I had the cream cheese lote. I obviously have a cheese addiction as well. I was going to go for the chocolate chip cookie and ice cream, but I wasn't ready to be jolted out of my mellow taste experience with something that sweet. I was super pleased that I didn't. This is a flat bread that is the consistency of a crepe, but with a little more crunch. The cheese actually is very subtle as is the cream anglaise. It sits atop some little bubbles, I can't remember the name name now (arghhh!), but they were sweet when I popped them in my mouth. There were different flavors and they really added some zing to the sort of savory taste of the crepe/cheese combo. Really pleasing to my mouth!\n\nThis restaurant is a brand new fave and I can't wait to go back. The owners are so friendly and awesome that I want to be their new best friend. As much as I'm about to start going I'm pretty sure we'll be on a first name basis soon! Get here.

Smokey Poke- about 3/4 cup of a portion, Ahi was chewy and flavor lacking. \nShort Ribs -were described as \"dr.pepper braised short ribs, candied carrots, and polenta bread\". What we got was ONE short rib (fix your menu) an carrot shavings that were probably candied in the morning cause they were just dried out with no flavor, 2 small pieces of raw broccoli and the polenta bread that tasted like plain old cornbread (skimping on the polenta)\nNachos Obrien- described as \" peppered pork, house made potato chips, Dublin cheese, stewed tomatoes\". What we got was potato chips with melted cheese, BACON with pepper shaker pepper sprinkled on it and diced tomatoes. I know bacon IS pork but don't exaggerate, just say bacon. We were imagining a roasted pepper crusted pork that was shredded or something. The bacon wasn't even pepper crusted, they could have at least did that. \n\nServer never checked on us but we were still polite and asked for the check since we are both in the industry.

I did end up watering it down after a bit, which significantly helped dilute the syrup, but it was good.\nPretzel brats - The top pretzel bun was toasted perfectly and had wonderful crunch to it. The item as a whole seemed a tad dry. It could've benefited from more sauerkraut or cheese sauce or something, but I felt the need to visit my glass of water or tea after every bite. Pretzel buns tend to be on the saltier/dryer side, and not much in this dish provided for moisture or hydration. But these were pretty good.\nMonte Cristo - It was a pretty typical monte cristo. Nothing bad, but nothing to write home about.\nSticky Bun Tacos - The sticky buns were unfortunately dry and were visibly cracking. The pork belly was good, but the flavors seemed like they could've been developed and infused more. A more moist bun and deeply flavored pork belly would've really made this dish a stand out.\nShort Rib Sliders - When you did get every ingredient in a bite (apple, bleu cheese, petite green, and short rib) it was delicious. But the ingredients were unevenly distributed and therefore each bite was incomplete. I got a huge chunk of bleu cheese in one bite (and don't get me wrong, I love bleu cheese), but the sweetness & crispness of the apple would've elevated and evened out that bite more. \n\nAll in all, it was okay.

I just assumed he was the bartender but then he started recommending stuff on the menu and talking about the recipes. Wow. It was obvious this guy loves what he does and has a passion for his business. \n\nThe DRINK: They have a good drink menu, and it seems they have a full \"bar\".

The last 3 times I have dined here it has been perfection. They have stepped up their game as a new east side restaurant. Got rid of the things that didn't work and embraced those that did. A family owned joint, that remembers their regulars. I have taken friends, family, and kids here and every time everyone is happy. A couple items that I personally love are the deviled eggs, the edamame, and the fondue. For a dessert you can't go wrong. There is the cookie-mon, choc chip cookie, and ice cream. Simple and great. There is the happy ending, which comes with popping mochi pearls. Or the Brie dawg with bananas and Brie cheese. \nThe most recent experience I had a full striped sea bass.

I know Dyanna and Brent have been to Nosh & Swig several times so I looked to them on what to get. Their answer was everything is good! \n\nNosh & Swig are a tapas type of place. So we of course ordered ALL the things and shared. We started with the Spicy Edamame and the deviled eggs. Once you start eating the Edamame you can't stop. Perfect spice! Next came out our Fondue which had apples, strawberries, bread, chips & some veggies to dip in the cheesy sauce. More food started coming out. Dyanna got the special which was a whole Seared Bass with the head and all! It was covered in a wonderful Sweet Chili sauce. It was excellent and a little birdie said it's going on their new menu in April. I'm so getting that next time. Joel had the Monte Cristo Sandwich which came with a berry compote. It was crispy and gooey with the fried egg on top. The Short Ribs came out next for Brent. I got the Dragons Claws. They were jalapenos stuffed with a spicy tuna and fried in tempura. The sauce on top was delicious. A great bite of food. We also all shared the Sticky Bun Tacos. Which I loved. Mmmmm pork belly. The Korean Bbq Wings had the perfect amount of spice. The Pretzel Brats were so tasty. I could have eaten like five more of those. The Chicken Apple Sausage is a great complement to the cheese gravy.We of course had to get dessert. Joel ordered the Cookiemon. It was cookie dough cooked in a little cast iron skillet with Vanilla Ice Cream on top. Mmmm so yummy. Brent got the Happy Ending it's kinda like a Thai Ice Cream taco. \n\nI think that is pretty much all we ordered. It was a lot of food and really not that expensive for what we got.
