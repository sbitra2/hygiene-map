The beer selection isn't fantastic and their prices are east coast range average, which is pretty lame, but I always enjoyed whatever I ordered.\n\nThat being said, their Frito Pie appetizer may be the most disgusting and delicious food item I have paid for.

They do have soy beans...for 4 bucks, the most I have ever seen edamame for-and while they can replace any burger with a veggie burger, the burgers cost like 9 bucks! I could buy two big packages of veggie burgers easy for that amount! \n\nSo not really a destination bar, more like a \"well...this is the only bar\" kind of bar.

The waiter carded me, he sure knows how to work the ladies, I made sure the husband left him a big tip.  I realized though that if I did actually look 21 - I know, I'm dreaming - and the toddler just turned three, that means it appears that I had him when I was 18 and possibly even got knocked up when I was 17?

Now I don't want to order it rare because they say it will come out cold in the middle so shouldn't medium rare come out just warm in the middle?  It always seems to come out more medium, just a tiny bit of pink in the middle.

The best deal in town for a huge breakfast! Steak, home fries, eggs and Texas toast for only $5.00!  You can't beat that with a stick, but a fork will do just fine.  That breakfast stayed with us all day.  The only thing they really need is more shade - we ended up eating inside the bar, because there is NO shade at the outdoor seating area.  Fine at night, but this time of year, a little too uncomfortable.\n\nWe were so impressed, we decided to come back for dinner when the \"town\" opened up. I'm not sure if it's because it's off season, but the town itself was not that impressive.  Yes, the buildings are cool, and they did a great job setting everything up.  It was just....well...boring.  The moved all the action into the \"stage\" area, and there were very few people in costume walking the streets and interacting with the guests.  It felt more like a ghost town then a wild west town.  \n\nOf course, this wasn't the reason we came back, which leads me to the third and final part of my review, the steak house.\n\nWe were seated right away, and a pretty decent C&W live band was playing, with lots of classics by Roger Miller, Johnny Cash and other classics.\n\nThe servers were friendly and helpful, and we took our time deciding what to eat.  We all decided to try the Rawhide Amber - a nice, well balanced beer.  We also started with the fried onion strings and fried green tomatoes (couldn't wait to cook ours up.)  The onion strings were great, and as a starter, the basket was plenty for 5 people to share.  The fried green tomatoes were good, the feta on top really tasted great, but the breading wasn't the best I've ever had.  They also brought out little cornbread muffins, the best I've had that my mom didn't make, and a jar of delicious bread and butter pickles.  Honestly, I probably could have walked away satisfied after just the starters!\n\nSide note:  We didn't bother with the rattlesnake, as we are all natives, and have had it before!\n\nOn to the main course, the three ladies ordered the Fillet Mignon, and the guys ordered one of the Sonoran Chicken specials and the Yellow Bellied Cowboy.  Sadly, I can't tell you how the Sonoran chicken was, as about 5 minutes before they served us, the waitress came to tell us that they were out.  We were left to wonder how long it takes to figure out you are out of something.  It turned out just fine, as they took the whole order off the check, but still brought my grandfather his side items, and we all shared with him.   It's not like we were running low on food...  The fillet was one of the best I've ever had, juicy and flavorful, cooked to perfection.  On a lovey bed of mashed potatoes that became infused with the juices of the fillet.\n\nMy mouth kept saying eat! Eat! but my stomach screamed for mercy, so I had to request a box.  We couldn't even think of dessert, but it sounded amazing from the descriptions on the menu!\n\nI'd go back for an awesome steak meal anytime, and plan on hitting up the market frequently, but I wouldn't build the town up to out of town guests.

I really wanted to do the old-time photos but that shop lacked information and timeliness.

Yes, you can walk down the street for free, but if you want any of the attractions they will charge you.  Be warned.\n\nOn to the steak house.\n\nThe ambiance is not bad.  Very rustic.  There was no band when we were there, but they do have a stage for one.  Not sure that would help.  \n\nThey have no bread service.  So after you order you have nothing to munch while you wait.

They appear to use real fire (which is a plus!).  But for $21 I expect a LOT more.  Frankly, Black Angus or Outback are just as good (or better) for less.  The fries were lukewarm.  Definitely not fresh from the oil.  And now comes the puzzle.  The chicken was cooked through, but still cold.  Not COLD, but not even really lukewarm.  Did they really cook this fresh?  I don't see how or it would have been HOT.  I suspect it was reheated.  And before you think maybe it was a fluke, the neighboring table had cold chili.  Yes, that's right.  Of the half dozen or so occupied tables at least TWO of them had cold meals.  Something is fishy here.\n\nThey did take the chicken (and the chili at the next table) back and replace it.  But I don't buy that it was a fluke.  I think they are reheating old food.  And doing a poor job of it.\n\nIf you want this sort of food (steak, chicken, etc), there are a lot of places you can go that will do it better for cheaper.
