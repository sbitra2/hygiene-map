Buckle your seatbelt:  this isn't going to be a smooth ride.\n\nOnce again, my theorem about YELP has been confirmed:  the more stars a restaurant has, the more you should avoid it.  I'm convinced that every prisoner released from Sheriff Joe's tent city is promised a $20 bill for their first night's meal in freedom, PROVIDED they write a review on YELP.  How else can one explain the 4 and 5 stars for this place?  Certainly, it couldn't be for the fluorescent lit diner atmosphere ... and it certainly couldn't be for the food ... could it?!?\n\nThe Hot n Sour soup was okay.  My partner thought it too sour.  Hello!  The \"sour\" isn't in the name to make it sound pretty.  I didn't think it too sour at all and they certainly don't skimp on ingredients:  the soup is loaded.  From there, however, it started going downhill faster than a snowball down the side of a steep ski run.\n\nThe egg rolls, too, weren't bad ... a bit greasy, but filled almost exclusively with cabbage, which I like.  But the two dishes specifically mentioned in reviews here -- the Devil Beef and the Mu Shu Pork -- were as disappointing as a visit to the U.S. Senate.  Unfortunately, the quality of the food matched the Senate's performance, too.  Even before I could open my mouth, my other half said what I was thinking when they brought the beef out:  \"My God!  It looks like someone's already eaten it!\"  Mushy, grey, and in spite of the jalapenos in it, bland.  Sort of like Senator John McCain, except it wasn't demanding we go to war in Syria.  And while it is advertised in the menu, Chinese food with ... jalapenos?!?  Chinese-Mexican fusion?!?!  \n\nThe Mu Shu Pork was something I'd never seen before in the many years I've eaten Chinese:  pre-rolled Mu Shu.  Usually, they bring you the wrapping and the filling is on the side and you make it yourself.  Not here:  they do it for you.  That by itself might have been acceptable to all but the Mu Shu Pork fanatic.  But what wasn't acceptable was the salt level in the food.  Unless you have a high tolerance for salty food, prepare to have lots of water nearby and watch your blood pressure go into the 150s over 110!\n\nService was fast, but almost like something out of a bad comedy about Chinese restaurants:  everything was brought at once, regardless of how close you were to finishing the previous course.  The only thing they DIDN'T do was observe you from a distance and wait for you to finish eating.\n\nIt pains me to give a bad review to a restaurant, which is obviously trying to please its customers.  In this case, however,  I'm afraid the review is fully justified.  I don't know who the people are on here, who think this is quality food.  I can only say to that one person, for example, who said he/she wishes this place was closer so he/she didn't have to drive all the way here:  KEEP DRIVING!  \n\nI rarely leave food on my plate and, when I do, I always ask for a doggie bag to take the leftovers home.

Originating from San Francisco, finding a stellar dim sum restaurant in the desert will definitely be a challenge!  But I'm on it!\n\nCathay House was voted best dim sum in the local papers and received other accolades as noted on its wall.  I had high expectations!  \n\nIt was bustling on a Sunday afternoon and there was a 10-15 minute wait for a party of 2.  Once seated in the main dining room, ice water, tea, and forks arrived immediately.  (Forks?)  Okay, so there were chopsticks already on the table but I guess out here, they are used to people asking for forks.  \n\nThere wasn't a huge variety of dim sum dishes to choose from, so that was already disappointing.  I did try the chicken feet in black bean sauce.  This dish lacked the full flavor that I'm used to.  The standard shrimp dumpling (har gow) and pork dumpling (shumai) were basic, if anything.  The salt and pepper shrimp had been sitting out too long after being stir-fried, not a good choice.  The beef rice noodle with a light soy sauce should be cut up to share a bit easier.  The crab claw puffs were average.\n\nI was anxious for the Shanghai dumplings, which they did not have.  Or the Shark Fin dumpling in soup with red vinegar and ginger slices to dip into.  Two of my favorites, and they were not available.  (And trust me, I did ask more than one employee for it.)\n\nLooking around for dessert, there were no egg custard tarts available or black sesame rolls.  I did see the sweet tofu, but that was about it.     \n\nThere were a lot of dishes that weren't being ordered, in other words...they looked stale as they passed our table numerous of times.  When you see the same cart pass you when you first sit down, and realize that the same dishes are still not moving on it an hour later, the turnover of food is not happening here.\n\nI also think it's odd that they serve dim sum until 10 pm.  In my opinion, a true tea house restaurant should only serve dim sum during brunch hours.  That is the whole point of \"drinking tea' aka yum cha or going for dim sum.  \n\nOverall, I don't plan on returning here unless I haven't found a better place yet.

The 4 Shrimp Har Gow had whole and chopped pieces of shrimp.\n\nThe 2 Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf (Loh Mai Gai) were flavorful.  They were generously filled with with chicken, Chinese mushroom, Chinese sausage, scallions, and dried shrimp.  They were one of the best I've had in a long time.\n\nThe 3 Deep-fried glutinous rice dumpling with pork (Haam Sui Gau):were hot and freshly fried.  They were stuffed with pork and dried shrimp and even some Chinese sausage.  \n\nThe Steamed Pork Spare Ribs with Black Bean Sauce had little cubes of acorn squash which was different.\n\nThe 3 Baked Sweet Buns had no filling.

We were quickly sat down, no need to wait.\n\nWe were given our menus and time to scan through it to see what we would like, it was a large selection but still seemed like it was small for a Chinese joint.

Anyways...\n\nI've been eating at Cathay house since I was a kid and I gotta say a lot has changed throughout the years. First big change was the shift of employees over to Chang's many years ago and now the big change in customer service. Back then, the food was so-so and the service even more \"meh.\" Now, I'd have to say that Cathay House has the best dim sum in town! Food was not served cold and the same cart would come around my table at LEAST 3 times. The dim sum wasn't gross and greasy either, which is a big plus. All in all, the quality of food has improved a good amount.\n\nHowever, what compels me to write this review is the major improvement in customer service. I came with a large party during lunch hours. It took a little long for us to get a table since we came during the peak hour. I noticed the back room was open and not all the tables were full, so I asked the hostess if we could just be seated there. THIS CLEVER WOMAN replies \"I'm sorry, we only have two waiters working that room together and I don't want you to have bad service.\" It was such a perfect answer I couldn't argue back. After my dining experience, I was glad we waited the extra 5 minutes for a table to clear just so we would truly have customer satisfaction.\n\nAs of right now, Cathay House is my favorite dim sum place in town, mostly because of a recent bad experience at Chang's. However, PLEASE avoid Orchid Garden for dim sum. I noticed they have 3.5 stars right now on yelp, but please if you care about the people you are dining with, you should not support their business!

The tea was clearly oversteeped. The highlight of the meal was actually the tripe, which was very clean and had great texture. Have prices creeped up over the years? We racked up a $70 bill for what didn't seem like very much food, especially in between all the limp veggies and half-filled dishes.\n\nThe service and cleanliness have also gone downhill; where I feel like Cathay House used to clearly be the nicest dim sum place in Chinatown, I can no longer say the same. While the servers are fairly patient and accommodating as usual, one of our party observed that some of kitchen staff don't perform the required hand wash after a bathroom visit, and that they were talking on their cellphones in the kitchen!

It's definitely NOT 5 stars as given by S.B. but it's got potential. Surprise is DESPERATE for quality Asian food. Saigon Kitchen is great Vietnamese but we could really use a GOOD Chinese place and no...Pei Wei is NOT good Chinese. \n\nThe service staff is VERY green, but they are very attentive, polite, and aim to please. The hostesses are adorable and enthusiastic, albeit very young, and very inexperienced BUT in a charming kind of way. Our server was very nice, very prompt, and apologetic for the newness of the restaurant and the kinks. (Suggestion-please don't have the hostesses dress like they are going to prom. It makes them seem even younger and more inexperienced than they already are) \n\nThe atmosphere is very clean and professional looking but you wouldn't know you were walking in to an Asian restaurant at all. I guess because I KNOW this used to be Picazzos...but they didn't change the decor AT ALL. The patio tables could use some sort of covering on them. The metal mesh tables weren't great when Picazzos owned the place and they still aren't great now.  A table cloth would be nice...or something more substantial than the metal mesh. \n\nThe food. I'll be kind and say it has potential. We had the chicken lettuce wraps and the sampler platter for an appetizer. The filling for the lettuce wraps was VERY plentiful but it lacked flavor. Even the sauce that they brought along with it, which I think was some sort of peanut sauce was very under-seasoned. The sampler had 2 of the following: egg rolls, crab puffs, wontons, chicken skewers, and fried shrimp. Everything was under-seasoned. There was no sauce for dipping either so that didn't help. \n\nOur entrees included Volcano Beef, Filet Mignon, Orange Zest Chicken and Mongolian chicken. These dishes were much better than the very underwhelming appetizers. While they were more flavorful than the apps, they were still very cautiously seasoned. All dishes come with white rice. If you want fried rice there is an additional $4 charge. They do not offer brown rice as an option. The menu is pretty common with most Cantonese style restaurants though so there is something for everyone. We liked each dish but hope that, with time, these will blossom into bolder seasoning and bigger flavor. Even adding salt would be a good start. And please don't under-season because of the Sun City crowd. They will be gone soon and you will need to cater to the people who live here year round. Trust me, we like SEASONED food. \n\nWe concluded with dessert after getting our hopes up from the main dishes but to say dessert fell flat is an understatement. We ordered the dessert sampler which included mochi, fruit soup, and tiramisu. The tiramisu is obviously frozen and not house made nor was it made with ladyfingers. It was super dry on the lower layer bordering on stale. The fruit soup was basically fruit cocktail in a glass of milk. And there must have been some issue with the mochi because it took a good amount of time for us to get our dessert and our server brought out the tiramisu and fruit soup telling us the mochi would be out \"soon\". \"Soon\" was about 10 minutes later. Dessert was VERY disappointing. \n\nThe portions were pretty generous although the sampler was kind of skimpy, only having 2 pieces of each item. Makes it hard for a party of 5 to really enjoy that offering but everything else was large enough for all of us to share and then some. The prices were pretty reasonable.\n\nThe biggest problem with Ann's Asian Bistro is that they are too conservative on flavor. They really need to amp it up if they are planning for the long-term. The service will work out its kinks and be fine but it won't be enough if the flavor isn't there. I am rooting for you Ann's Asian Bistro and I definitely will be back to check you out.

Diane and I were seated on a comfortable banquette and a Chinese-themed chair behind a black lacquered table.\n\nThis was our best bargain of RW, because for $30.13 the first course for each person included an Asian Tapas Sampler that consisted of a Steamed Shrimp Dumpling with Chili Aioli, Pan Fried Pork Potsticker, and a Spicy Wonton; the second course a choice of Wok Seared Salmon with Ginger Basil Sauce, Grilled BBQ Korean Short Ribs, or Honey Walnut Shrimp with Lemon Aioli; and the third course a Dessert Trio of Chocolate Ganache, Lemongrass Gelee with Coconut Tapioca, and Lychee Mochi Ice Cream.  None of the appetizers or desserts could be ordered in such combinations off the regular menu except to pay for each item separately.\n\nThe potsticker was excellent with Ginger Sauce.  I didn't find the wonton to be spicy at all.  And, I quickly gobbled up the delicious steamed dumpling.  Since I was very hungry and wanted to thoroughly check this place out, plus present a more comprehensive review, I also ordered a bowl of Spicy Chicken Hot & Sour Soup, which was nicely hot and spicy as billed, with morsels of chicken, bamboo shoots, Wood Ear Mushrooms, Green Onions, and Black and Glass Noodles--a fairly mild but still spicy, good-sized serving for one diner.\n\nLucky for me, Diane had a Hard Rock Hotel BOGO coupon for Fu from the night before when we had become introduced to Culinary Dropout, so besides two entrees of Honey Walnut Shrimp, we were also presented with our ordered choice of Kung Pao Chicken.  Diane got her Walnut Shrimp devegetablized but I enjoyed the cool cucumber slices that served to offset the warm and large battered shrimps.  The Lemon Aioli on this dish was subtle, the shrimps were succulent, and the candied walnuts were neatly covered with sesame seeds.  This entree was quite large in size.\n\nIndeed, there is no noticeable portion control in operation here.  The Kung Pao Chicken that was plunked before me on a platter was easily enough to serve two (even though I ate two entrees by myself).  But I'm a big boy with a big appetite!  LOL!  This was dead-ahead Cantonese Kung Pao Chicken just mildly spicy with slices of Red and Green Bell Pepper, mostly whole peanuts, and no visible Chili Peppers.  The spice emanated from the Brown Sauce in which the large tender hunks of chicken and other ingredients were bathed.  No filler like celery was present, and no fat clung to the top-tier chicken.\n\nIn the assemblage of desserts, the tapioca tasted lemony, and the mochi resembled the flavor of vanilla.  The Chocolate Ganache with chocolate rabbit ears on top, and cake underneath, was fabulous.  Even the smooth and hot Jasmine Mist Organic Tea was great!  And, refilled ceramic pots just kept on coming for the extensive duration of our dinner.  The meal lasted long because I was barely able to finish all of the fine Cantonese food laid out before me.  But eventually I did!\n\nThumping music added to the otherwise serene ambiance.  And, service was friendly and excellent, and so accommodating that when I asked for Sweet & Low, although I found out that it is not normally served in the restaurant (Splenda and Equal are), a server on his own initiative left the restaurant to get some from Room Service, and quickly returned with a large supply of pink packets.\n\nThis was a great way for us to bid goodbye to Restaurant Week just before we left for California.  And, we will surely be back for more of the wonderful Cantonese food so graciously served at Fu.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 7, "useful": 11, "cool": 11}}, {"text": "Excellent food!!\n\nThe lobster puff balls are really good!!\n\nTry all the Tapas on the menu!!!\n\nTony the manager is super friendly and remembers your name and makes you feel right at home! :)", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "What's up FU!?

Instead of battering the pork and deep frying it, they do it in a way that the batter isn't fried in. Its like a separate layer above the meat so you can taste both parts when you bite into it. Its weird to explain but its good. So good, that we order it every time we go there. \n\nThe Pan Fried Sea Bass is my absolute favorite. The lightly fried sea bass comes swimming in sweet soy sauce but it doesn't overpower the taste nor the light crisp. Definitely a must order.\n\nThe Roast Duck here is waaaaaay better than at Sam Woo BBQ. The dish here actually has large chunks of meat. It has a right combination of crispy skin and meaty meat. That's the way this dish should be served.\n\nThe Salt and Pepper Sea Bass was good but not a must have. The Spicy String Beans with Pork was good also.... But not a must have.

Definitely a must have if you like this kind of dish.\n\nLast but not least, the Garlic Ong Choy is one of my favorite veggie dishes. It was cooked perfectly.

This dish you can order anywhere and I was sort of sick of it from places like Panda. However, that is only due to the fact that I forgot how much better it tastes at authentic Chinese restaurants.

But I'm sure for everyone else they still love it. The fish is very light that is balanced with the soy sauce and oil. The chopped scallions also adds a nice touch, almost like sprinkles on a sundae.

I was truly impressed because the fish still held up it's shape and it wasn't distorted into pieces (if that was my job, it would have been another story).

I consulted with him and he assured me that 'americans' like myself would still be able to find something to eat at Joyful House, so we decided to check it out. \n\nThe restaurant is quite large and well-lit, with a bunch of (like 15) tanks for fresh seafood that you can see. It seemed like a pretty legit operation and my coworker was already conversing in mandarin (or something) with the friendly wait staff, so we knew we'd be treated to a wide variety of dishes.\n\nSpeaking of wide variety, everybody ordered a bunch of stuff and then my coworker spoke to the waiter and apparently ordered like 6 more dishes. Everything is family style, so we had waaaayyyy too much food, even for our large group of like 12. Here's a quick run down:\n\nGarlic Baby Bok-Choy - loved it. Not bland like your usual veggie dishes. Highly recommend.\nMandarin pork chop - the favorite of several people at the table. Sweet and breaded, which is my fave.\nSizzling steak - just ok. We were pretty pumped after the sizzling presentation, but it wasn't anything special. Not spicy (despite the warning on the menu).\nClay pot scallops - served with rice noodles and really good.\nSeafood dish - don't know what it was called, but I really liked it. It came with shrimp, crispy noodles, and some other stuff I can't remember. My 2nd fave.\nClay pot eggplant - good not great.\nPork fried rice - standard.\nString beans with pork - good not great.\nAppetizer soup - just the soup they serve to everybody, I guess - beef broth with nothing in it. It was as good as you can make beef broth, but the 1 year old LOVED it, so bonus for that.\nTapioca Dessert Soup - no thank you. If you're into tapioca, you might like it.\nLemon iced tea - really good! Sweetened, but not too sweet. I actually had two glasses, which I usually don't do.\n \nPrices were kinda high - $15-20/meat dish, but everything was good, including the service.\n \nAny time I have somebody in town craving a 'fancier' Chinese meal, we will definitely take them to Joyful House.\n \nBonus points for being open late (til like 3am)!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Unfortunately Yelp REALLY  let me down w/ this restaurant.

The batter and spicing/seasoning of the pork was very well done. Quite crisp and a good balance of salt/heat/batter/fat.

Anyway, it stays open late, til 5 am, and appears to be very popular with the Asian community for larger family dinners.. they have a private banquet room as well. It is usually very busy, but if you keep vampire hours, it is one of the better options for dinner at 3 or 4 am. \n\nThe menu is heavy on esoteric East Asian food....a lot of the menu is not the same old \"safe\" Moo Goo Gai Pan, but everything I have had there is great.  \n\nHot Pot dinners appear to be also very popular there, with the table-top heated pot of heated oil or water and a plate of various meats and vegetables that are dipped in the pot to cook.

It's about 1 pm on a Saturday and this restaurant isn't as busy as I had hoped.  (Not a good sign.)\n\nMy friend and her dining companion are already enjoying their Pineapple Buns with Egg Custard when we arrive. This is definitely a good sign!  (I'm not sure if the buns were hot when they came out, since I arrived a bit late.)  I enjoyed the sweetness of the custard, but the BF found it to be too sweet for him.\n\nWe ordered their standard shrimp dumplings and pork dumplings.  Both were standard.  They even had the Shanghai dumplings readily available as well.  They were tastier than Orchids Garden's version, that's for sure! http://www.yelp.com/biz/Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ?hrid=aU3RP30FNJmzdi1e-Ksa-g  And since the red vinegar is left out on the table, you can feel free to drown it as much as you'd like!\n\nWe also had Chinese broccoli, shrimp on tofu, crab/shrimp puff thing, shrimp rice noodle, and chicken feet in black bean sauce.  All were pretty good.  We even had the salt and pepper shrimp that came right out of the kitchen, so it was nice and hot.  \n\nThe downside?  Service was blah, I mean really blah.  The ladies never smiled or showed any personality whatsoever.  And the guys working there were not that great either.  They refilled our teapot, but left it on the far end of the table, out of our reach.  One lady was very indifferent as she slid our order across our table.  They were quick to clean up our plates once the bill was settled, which can be a good or bad thing.  (It usually means they want you out of their fast so they can have the table back.)\n\nInstead of sending the carts to the back for refills, they have waiters carrying a bunch of dishes in their hands or stacking them up and then placing them on a the cart.  I'm not so sure this is visually appealing.  \n\nThe bill was about $40 for four, not including tip.  We found this to be a bit more expensive than Orchids Garden and Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine since we know we ate less here.  (The BF wasn't so sure we got the correct bill even since the guy handling all the checks seemed quite unorganized.)\n\nOverall, the selection was there, although lacking in desserts.  (I did see the sweet tofu come out, but no custard tarts!)  They did have a few things that some of the other dim sum restaurants didn't seem to have.  Sometimes you get the feeling they are really trying to push a dish on you.  I mean, how often can the congee lady come by asking if we want congee?  Because the restaurant is a bit smaller and they don't push the carts into the back, you'll find the ladies 'idling' by one side of the restaurant, which was pretty much hanging out by our table.  They could really use a lesson or two in customer service.

Grew up in Boston, where there was always good Chinese restaurants, dim sum or otherwise.  Worked with my father (as a kid) at one of the restaurants he worked in (as a busser, the bar boy or general help).  And, of course, there was mom's and Grandma's cooking, and my friends' mothers' cooking, so I would say I'm kinda in the know.\n\nI'm in the military, since 1989.  Where I currently live, the only Chinese you get are the buffets, which to me is catering to the community, which doesn't have a large Chinese community, if you catch my drift.  I understand that business is business, and some of the restaurants are trying to sneak in some \"real\" dim sum items, but still ...\n\nWent to LV a few years back, and found out that there's a Chinatown.  But I'll call it what it is:  Asian Alley (I should say Avenue).  There's a large selection of Asian businesses for what you want:  Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Viet, et al.  (My sister, who lives in LA and occasionally trips down to LV, didn't even know until I recently told her.)  It had been years since I had dim sum, and was hurting for it.  Drove down to Chinatown (it wasn't too developed back then), and found Harbor Palace.\n\nHarbor Palace reminds me of the dim sum restaurants I went to while growing up.  The food and atmosphere takes me back, and I'm a kid again, a kid in a candy shop.  If the candy was dim sum.\n\nWent back to LV temporarily in 2008, and decided I will have as much dim sum as I could stand for lunch and dinner (I would get take out).  I would eat at least $20 every trip, so I spent over $250 in less than a month, and that's just on dim sum only.\n\nFound out a few months ago that I'll be moving permanently to LV around May 09, and you can bet  your ass I'm heading back to Harbor Palace.\n\nOkay, here's the food review.  If you've never been to a real Chinese restaurant, give it a try.  The food you find in buffets is analogous to eating Taco Bell for Mexican.  You've had beef before?  Chicken?  Shrimp?  Pork?  Then most of the dishes you can eat because you've had it before, either as a burger, buffalo wing, or so on.  It's the way the food is prepared that I think scares people, because they've never had it cooked that way before.  If you ask the staff, they'll tell you what the protein is; vegetables are vegetables, and everybody needs more veggies so eat up.  The dim sum dishes are cheap enough that if you get a dish and don't like it, it won't be an expensive experiment.\n\nSome may say that the service is a little off-putting, because of attitude or some imagined slight.  That's just the way it is, folks.  People go to France and talk about the rude waiters there.  If you already know and go, then why grouse about it?  Keep in mind the staff at the Harbor are immigrants, and English isn't their first language, so please be gracious, patient and understanding.\n\nWhy not 5 stars?  With the amount of money the owner(s) got coming in, the place could use a tune up.\n\nOoh, and don't forget that there are fish tanks, if you choose to pick your own victim for a meal.

I asked if they would show the speech on one of the three TVs which were all turned off.

I ordered the fried calamari and the Pad Ga Pow (might be spelled differently on the menu) with beef.  Interestingly enough they do not serve pork here!  \n\nThe calamari was quite nice.  It came with about half tempura squid and half tempura veggies.  If you can forgive the veggies and don't mind eating a little healthier, I would recommend this dish.  The batter was very, very light perhaps one of the lightest I have had, but had enough flavor to keep it interesting.  They use the typical Thai style sweet and sour sauce, clear and pinkish red in color, not too sweet, and with light tasting chili flakes.  \n\nThe Ga Pow was very unique and surprising.  I haven't had this dish prepared in this style before.  The waitress informed me that it is more of a Southern style Thai restaurant.  The meat was very lean and finely minced.  At first I thought it was hamburger by the look, but I was definitely mistaken when I tasted it.  It was very light and almost fluffy.  No feeling of extra grease or fat.  The veggies (onions, bell peppers, etc) were well prepared and fresh tasting.  On top of jasmine rice, it was a very light version of the dish.  One thing to note here is that this place is quite a bit hotter than most Thai restaurants.  The waitress warned me that my 3/5 was VERY hot.  The spice level did not disappoint, and I quite enjoyed the heat level balanced with the lighter flavors.  The dish was not sweet at all, which deviates from the typical version of this dish you find in Vegas.  Very light on the palate and the stomach.  The one criticism I might have is that it also wasn't very complex (no or very little basil, mint, etc), but as simple as the flavors were they worked very well.  \n\nI am very curious about the style of this Thai cooking.  I most certainly will be back to try some of the other dishes like the curries and noodle dishes.  Their motto is no sweetness, and I like that in a Thai restaurant.

It pretty decent size compare too the front entrance thinking too myself this place is tiny. The waiter she was fabulous greeted me warm welcome and since lunch not very packed she like pick anywhere too sit. The menu is fairly simple with most staple Thai dishes find at most other Thai restaurants. I wanted too try couple things so started with the gyoza but this one was all vegetables no pork in the filling. Interesting. The filling definitely not as hearty and maybe use too gyoza traditional sense only way with pork felt like filled with air. The dipping sauce was nice. The way they steamed then seared the gyoza was on point. Just not that much fan of the filling but think great option if vegan. My entree went with the Spicy Basil Fried Rice. Sakina spicy rating they go only from 1-5. So being first time not sure played it safe went with 2. I wish went higher because 2 felt like bland and thinking Spicy Basil Friend Rice no kick factor. I know next time go higher and for all spicy fans not sure where 5 is compare too other Thai restaurants go 1-10. I enjoyed the mixture of vegetables in the fried rice, the sauce that fried rice cooked in (my own fault should have went 3 or 4) solid, and fried rice could eat everyday. I plan on coming back trying more dishes. Overall honest nothing that can rave about or compare too my favorites Archi or Pan Asian. I only had two dishes.

A little tingle but no pain, and tons of flavor with the herbs and crunchy veg.  Good seafood mix, giant muscles and grilled shrimp, so-so squid.\n\nYakisoba, Meat Combo -- Pleasantly sweet noodles with lots of veg and meat.  Skip the plain (but moist) thin strips of beef and chicken, just go all shrimp, baby.  I wish there was more cabbage.  (Good line for my tombstone, gotta remember that one.)\n\nCrispy Catfish Salad -- Bizarre at first, since the fish is minced super fine, then fried to an indiscernible crisp ... so we just saw a blanket of brown crunchies and were confused where the \"fish\" went.  But after the lovely server explained it's a different style, we mixed it in with a green apple salad and our faces basically exploded with tart, sweet, spicy crunch.  In fact, we kept spooning the mixture over everything else we ate, because it had a crunch that could not be stopped.  I wouldn't be satisfied with just this plate for dinner, but it's an excellent sharing dish for punching up everything else.\n\nCrab Rangoon -- Unlike any I've had, rolled long and thin in spring roll wrappers.\n\nI'm diggin how this place comes at my usual orders with a different angle.  I also appreciate the Chinese options on the menu, since our group doesn't all love Thai, so everyone leaves happy and stuffed.\n\nAlso in love with their roti, since I haven't found roti this good since Flat Top Grille in Chicago.

The waitress was very sweet and helpful - including getting gloves and showing my daughter how to properly properly wrap the spring rolls in lettuce and mint for maximum flavor. All in all we were very pleased with both the food quality and the service. We arrived rather late only a half hour before close and at no time did we feel like they were rushing us out the door so that they could close up.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Wonderful place.

We used to go twice sometimes three times a week, but we moved to QC but still manage to go there once a week. We always order the Pho. Even in the summer time, it's always my favorite thing to get. Also the chicken pot stickers are delish. They don't taste like your typical gyoza or dumplings. Very crispy and tasty. \nTheir orange chicken is also another favorite. They don't over batter the chicken like they do at panda. They make it so it's just crispy and made with all white chicken.  \nDiane and her husband do such a great job running the place.
