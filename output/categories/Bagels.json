The Portobello Benedict is more expensive than all but the one with lox which was kinda sad since I am vegetarian.  They have departed from the standard eggs benedict with not a appealing result.  It comes on a bagel that is supposed to be toasted which is wasn't. So it was cold and chewy and a whole lot of bread in comparison to the rest of the toppings. They also decided to add cheese to all of the different combos which when you combine it with the hollandaise is not a good thing.

Very disappointing there are far better eggs benny in the area ( see my other reviews )  Maybe this place is just not for vegetarians.

I had to make a snap decision or I could've read that novel all night. \nSeeing the famous original Jewish sliders (featured on Food Network's Man vs. Food so they MUST be good, right??) I made my decision. And they come with gravy, which should always be a win-win. \nI also ordered the matzo ball appetizer and tried the potato knish. Both were mostly flavorless, greasy, and tasted frozen. The matzo app was served with a ranch dipping sauce (WHY??!) and the potato knish was a small, lonely loaf of deep-fried sadness. The rest of the meal was even more disappointing. The sliders came out very quickly-- much too quickly to be freshly made. They came with a side of potato wedges, which tasted rather stale and definitely was frozen. The sliders were larger than expected, but the buns were heavily greased and required multiple napkins throughout the meal. The brown gravy served on the side as well as on the sliders was nothing to write home about either -- tasted like any other gravy, I guess if you like that powdered gravy mix taste. \nI'm not sure what kind of meat was on the sliders... Beef? I'm guessing so as its supposed to be a Jewish style/New York delicatessen.

We did the smart thing and called ahead to let them know that such a large party was planning to dine there at 1:30.  We were seated in a \"party room\" which had a TV, fireplace, and plenty of room, which was nice, but it also was dirty.  Three tables had previous diners' dirty dishes and cutlery left on them.  The floor hadn't been swept.  And, one busser stopped in and cleaned off only one of those table during the two hours we were stuck in there.\n\nSo now for the real problem...  We were seated in this dirty room and after a few minutes a waiter came in.  We all ordered food and drinks.  It became very obvious the one server assigned to our group was overwhelmed.  It must have been at least 10 to 15 minutes before we started to see any of those drinks.  I don't know how long it takes to pour drinks for 15 people, but couldn't someone at least bring some pitchers of water and glasses during that time?  Drinks finally arrived.  Then nothing.  It was an hour later when some pickles were brought to the table.  I'm not joking.  An hour later and our meals still weren't ready.  It was 2:30 in the afternoon.  I was planning on being at least getting ready to pay my bill by that time.  Fortunately, none of the kids were complaining, but at least make sure they got their orders in a fair amount of time.  Everyone was hungry.  Neither the server nor the food were anywhere to be seen.  When our orders finally arrived at 3:00, the trays were placed on one the still dirty tables (a few of us noticed, but everyone was too hungry to complain).  The saving grace was that none of the orders were wrong.  The waiter was smart enough to bring free cookies with the bill, but the only reason none of us got a manger and complained was because it was nearly 3:30 and we all had places to go and just wanted to get out.\n\nThe one redeeming part of the visit is that the food is the same as every other Chompie's.

Another thing they had in the cold case which I found to be odd were jars of Nathan's pickles.  Nathan's, like the hot dog place.  I would imagine a Jewish deli would have Ba Tampte pickles....I didn't even know Nathan's made pickles!  It was a little lame to be honest.\n\nAnyways, I go up to the counter where there doesn't seem to be anyone working.  There was no organization to it.  So I waited.  And waited.  In New York, the deli is a finely tuned machine designed to move people quickly.  Chompie's? Eh, not so much.  When I finally did place my order, the guy who took it had a hard time punching it into the computer and asked me to repeat it several times.  Despite saying I wanted my bagel toasted several times I was given a cold, untoasted bagel.  I waited a little longer for my order to come up and went on my merry way.  \n\nHere is the breakdown of the food we ordered-\n\nMatzoh ball soup- Surprisingly good.  I have never had matzoh ball soup with carrots and celery...so much chazerei!  Just give me the matzoh ball! Although, I will admit, it was solid.  I wouldn't go all the way to Chompie's for it because I know that I can make it better in my own kitchen. \n\nPlain bagel \"toasted\" with cream cheese- Terrible.  The bottom of the bagel was entirely too thick and was very hard.  They didn't even cut it all the way through, probably because the crust is too thick! \n\nCorned beef on rye- Meh.  The corned beef wasn't very good, it wasn't corned enough.  If they make their own they didn't use a piece of brisket that was fatty enough.  The rye (which was not marble rye...) was lackluster.   It couldn't handle the corned beef, became soggy, and eventually fell apart.  The pickle it came with was the grossest thing I've ever seen.  And it was definitely a kosher dill, even though I asked for a half sour.  The potato salad was actually really good though.\n\nKnish- Terrible.  The knishes in my elementary school cafeteria were better than this.  First of all, the outer crust was way too flimsy.  It should have been much, much, thicker, especially considering the gargantuan size of the knish.  We essentially ate a large plate of mashed potatoes.  The potato inside itself was unremarkable.  Not only do I have this Jewish thing going on but I'm also Irish....I've never met a potato dish I didn't like.  Until today.  I didn't even finish my half of the knish. \n\nNow for the prices.  What's with this meshugas?  $2.29 for a bagel with cream cheese is a tad much.  In NY they run you about $1.35.  The corned beef sandwich was $12.50!  Now, I've paid that much for sandwiches in NY before but you get 2 lbs of meat and several layers of sandwich!  This was not a $12.50 sandwich.  I was also going to get us some whitefish salad to sample but at $15.99/lbs it wasn't happening.  \n\nWhy anyone should schlep all this way, in this heat, schvitzing all over, for this dreck?

Great, but shouldn't someone check on that from time to time?  Re: pastrami, she checked the meat and and confirmed it was over the top.  According to the deli guy every once in a blue moon they'll get a piece of meat that wasn't cured properly.  I mentioned the poor service and the manager excused it due to our server being new.

WHY do does anyone close their kitchen before 11 in Phoenix is beyond me but that is a separate issue.\n\nI check my phone for the time to make sure I have not lost time in a department store and voila!

I thought a turkey ruben was a turkey ruben and didnt have choices, so I'm like- \"I\"ll just have it how it normally is done\". Well I ended up with a dry-ass plain turkey sandwich. No ruben to it. I was upset, and I had gotten it to go so there was no going back. \n\nMaybe I wasn't clear or the cashier didnt here the \"ruben\" part but anyway, it was a botched visit. I plan on hitting them up again soon and trying again- in house this time.

The bread was sliced so poorly that I literally had half of my bread missing on one side of the sandwich.

From there, they grew into a new location on Greenway and added several more locations throughout the valley.  In Phoenix, it's always a good sign when a restaurant is still around two years later, let alone thirty.  Chompies has established itself as a traditional NY style deli.  Now, I've never been to the city, so I cannot argue whether or not this place is a true New York style deli, but I can tell you it is good enough for me.  Breakfasts served all day (most items), Eggs Benedict is made with a homemade Hollandaise sauce, with your typical home fries and fresh fruit on the side.  Eggs are always cooked to order and my wife's favorite has always been bagels and lox.  She has it every time she goes, not trying anything else.  The sandwiches are gargantuan, as are the prices for these sandwiches, but they are good.  The brisket is juicy and tender, the pastrami flavorful and piled high.  The last time I ate there I had the Borenstein burger.  I figure if I ordered something you don't traditionally get in a deli, it will show how well they break out of their mold.  I'll have to say the burger was not bad.  I ordered it medrare with American Cheese and Bacon.  The burger is a half pound of beef slathered with the cheese appropriately melted and grilled on a real grill, not a griddle.  The grilled flavor really comes through on this sandwich.  The bun is fresh and toasted, assisting with that great grilled flavor.  Bacon was crispy and the usual accoutrement was fresh and crispy.  The burger is served with crispy-coated potato wedges, crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside.  Yum.  Of course, I have mine with a side of mayo for dipping.  The plate is rounded out with a small cup of crispy cole slaw, slightly sweet and a perfect foil for the burger.  To quench my thirst, I had the usual iced tea.

To get right to the point, I recently ordered a Ruben with pastrami (AKA as a Rachel, which I have ordered many times before) and was very disappointed. This is the most basic of deli sandwiches and one that I often use as an indicator of how good the rest of the menu is. In my book, if you're running a deli and can't get this sandwich right, you might as well close up the place. \n\nThe sandwich that came to my table was half the size of the usual one and cost even more than I expected. Obviously, the price of everything on their menu has increased by at least $2 or more. If you are going to charge $14 for a Ruben/Rachel, it had better be one hell of a sandwich. The rye bread looked like it had been cut in half across its width and although the pastrami was stacked high, there were too many fat pieces hanging along the edge. I understand that some of the flavor comes from the fat left on the meati, but this was way too much. The sandwich was also greasy and it looked to be from a huge dousing of butter on the the rye bread. Overall, the sandwich was still pretty good, but not anywhere near the $14 price. At many other delis, I could get two sandwiches for that price!\n\nIt's not that I mind paying more for quality food, but lately, the already overpriced items at Chompie's have hit a new level. Sure, everything costs more today and I understand that restaurants are paying more than ever for their ingredients. However, if you really look at what you are getting for your money at Chompie's, you will soon realize that you are being taking advantage of. Call it greed or whatever you want, but the math doesn't add up for what you get. To add insult to injury, you are reminded of their ridiculous prices both when you enter the restaurant on the bakery side and when you leave the same way.

It is a New York Deli in Phoenix's Paradise Valley Mall that gives New York delis in New York City a run for their money.\n\n  My brother and I came across Chompie's Deli after walking out of a nearby restaurant that gave a mediocre first impression. As soon as we walked in the door of Chompie's Deli, we had a confident first impression. A 15-minute wait persuaded us that we were in for a wonderful dining experience.\n\n  A fifteen minute wait at Chompie's is time well used. Their menu is enormous, leaving several difficult choices to make.\n\n  In my situation, when it was time to order, the choices were simple. I ordered two New York Kosher deli icons that I grew up to love in New York and have been having difficulty finding in Las Vegas. They were a knish and kasha Varnishkas. The size of a Chompie's knish is of higher rank than any that I tasted in New York. By the time I finished the potato knish and kasha varnishkas, it dawned on me how much I miss the New York Kosher Deli food.\n\n  In similar fashion to their knish, Chompie's is a large restaurant. It has the same foot print of a T.G.I Friday's with both an entrance from inside and separate from the Paradise Valley Mall.\n\n  Chompie's Deli is more than eating out. They also have a thriving take out business. My brother took out chocolate covered rainbow cookies. Like the Twinkies, chocolate covered rainbow cookies are scarce. Instead of paying $1,000 for a Twinkie on EBay, you can buy something in the ballpark of eight chocolate covered rainbow cookies for nearly $10 in Chompie's. And, near the take out counter there is interesting newspaper clippings that tell the story of Chompie's growth.\n\n Regardless of how well Chompie's excels at their New York Deli business, I offer some constructive criticism. Disparate from the New York Kosher delis that I have dined in, complimentary pickles and cole slaw are nonexistent here.  Then again, this tradition could have changed since the last time I visited New York five years ago.\n\n  I am pleased that my brother and I found Chompie's Deli. Now if a serious urge for a potato knish and kasha varnishkas hits me, instead of boarding an airplane for New York, I can drive around 250 miles to Phoenix.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 4, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "Chompie's is a fun place to go in AZ.

An out-of-town houseguest was the perfect reason to go back.\n\nWe presented the coupon upon ordering our food. The server said \"hang on to that (coupon.)\"  He said that other people had trouble with the fine-print terms of the coupon. He cautioned us to order only items at or above $ 7.99.

The bagels were great.\n\nWhen the server left the bill at the table ($27) I reminded him about the coupon and asked him to recalculate the bill.  He returned with the same bill, saying that \"one of our dishes was a special, and therefore it was not eligible for the coupon discount.\"  We asked to see a manager. \n\nThe manager came to our table and listened to our plea. He did not say much.

Something changed with Chompies a while ago and it's not a good one. I have been coming here ever since they were at 32st and Greenway. They used to have the best pastrami sandwich out there. They also used to have fantastic baked goods. Now, there pastrami is sub standard. It's fatty, it's chewy, it's flavorless and it's about half the size it used to be. This has been at least 8 times in a town now. $14 for a small, very poor quality pastrami sandwich is inexcusable. \n   I had lunch here yesterday and I was so disappointed that I ended up at Jimmy Johns later that night and they put the crap Chompies served me to shame. That's pretty bad to have a chain sub shop have a better quality sandwich then a so-called New York style deli that's been in business for years. \n    Sadly, there baked goods have gone through the same extreme drop in quality as there food. I always end up getting a black and white cookie to go after my meal. These are my favorite cookies. I'm from New York and my parents and I have been eating these for about 40 years. Chompies B/W's used to be nice and soft and had a great frosting. Now, they are hard and dried out with no flavor. \n     I'm sorry guys, but your food has gone all the way down hill.

Not the best.\n\nWe stopped into Chompie's this past Friday morning on our way out of town for the long weekend. My husband and I have this obsession with breakfast bagels - in particular, breakfast bagels from one amazing joint that makes the absolute best breakfast bagel EVER in our college's hometown. We are always searching for a place as good as Bodo's...well, even 3/4 as good as Bodo's would do...and we never find it. Bodo's is about the most efficient bagel store on Earth (literally the line of 40-50 people is serviced in 10 minutes) and cheap, too!\n\nSo, we decided to give Chompie's a whirl. I don't love the location - like everything else in Arizona, it is tucked into a strip mall. However, there was enough parking and we found it just fine. When you walk in, you're a bit confused as to where to go. Then you realize if you want to eat a full service sit down meal, head to the left - we didn't want to do this, but the food that I was eyeing from afar looked good. To the right is their bakery, which has some pretty appetizing cakes, cookies and desserts. Then there is this counter where you deduce that you order \"to go\" meals. We were overwhelmed by the menu but managed to pull ourselves together in time to order. We both had that initial panic attack of \"oh crap, I have never been here and the menu is longer than a 5 year old's Christmas list and I don't even know where to start because suddenly I feel like I can't even read English.\" Deep breath. It's not actually that overwhelming, just a tad unorganized. After ordering, we were instructed to walk all the way across the bakery to a random counter to pay. It was so random the way they had it set up, but we did as we were told and then we waited.\n\nMy husband's sandwich took a while to make....again, I don't know how Bodo's does it, but Chompie's is probably 4 times slower. Or is it more appropriate to say that Bodo's is 4 times as fast? Whatever. Either way, Bodo's has the breakfast bagel process down perfectly. Waiting was fine, though...we weren't in a rush. When my husband's warm sandwich was finally ready, we got our stuff and then headed outside (there is nowhere to eat inside if you don't want to have a full service meal, which is one complaint I would make about this place). Who wants to eat their bagel outside when it's pushing 110 degrees? Not me. Even if I am under a strip mall canopy that provides some shade.\n\nAnyway, his sandwich was actually really tasty - warm and fresh and really yummy. My bagel was not toasted, which I had requested, which was slightly annoying. However, the bagel itself was very good. We will definitely be back for the food, and I totally recommend this place for grabbing some freshly baked bagels or desserts or whatever. They do have a deli counter as well (meats, cheese, etc). Our breakfast was less than $8 without drinks - fair enough.\n\nI just wish that the layout were a little better and that it was more efficient. I also wish I could have eaten inside. Next time we will likely just do the full service thing.\n\nIn the end, it seems that nothing will ever compare to our beloved Bodo's in Charlottesville, Virginia.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "Oy vay!

I asked my server for her opinion and she suggested trying the Sliders and making a combo with the Original Jewish Sliders (Mini Challah Rolls, Brisket, Potato Pancakes, Jack Cheese, Brown Gravy) and the Western Sliders (Mini Challah Rolls, BBQ Brisket, Cheddar Cheese, Onion Strings).....there would be 3 Sliders of my choice and Fries for $11.99.  I decided to go for it and ordered the combo with 1 Original Jewish Slider and 2 BBQ Beef Sliders.\n\nAfter a short wait my food came out.  I couldn't wait to dive into it.  I went for the Jewish Slider first.  I've never had anything like this before.....it was dripping with Gravy.  Took one bite and could taste the Gravy, Potato Pancake, and Jack Cheese immediately....then I could taste the Brisket, which was very moist.  It was pretty good, but I'm not a big fan of Gravy unless it's Thanksgiving.\n\nNext I went for the BBQ Brisket Sliders......they were very tasty.  The proportion of BBQ Sauce and Onion Strings were just right to give it that Sweet & Tangy flavor.  Of the two types of Sliders I prefer the BBQ Sliders over the Jewish Sliders.  The Fries were Breaded Wedge Cut Fries and were awesome......crispy on the outside and moist & soft on the inside.  The spices on the Fries were very good too.\n\nOverall, it was a good meal.  My server was very friendly and checked up on me often to make sure I was satisfied with my meal.  She offered to replace the Jewish Slider if I didn't like it.  I told her that it was good and then she suggested Pumpkin Creme Brulee for Dessert.  I wasn't planning on Dessert, but couldn't resist and said yes.

I have ordered a lot of items from Chompie's, the majority of them very good, which is why I gave them 4 stars. They are unique, their menu items are novel and I enjoy the variety.

Mo H remarked how good the pickles were? Really? I felt they were too soft, and not tart enough, although I do prefer a half sour.\n\nWhere Chompie's hits the mark is with their unique menu items. You must try the \"Jewish sliders.\" This is basically a shabbas meal put on a challah bun. Brilliant. The brisket is amazing. So tender, like butter, the potato pancake is perfect, I don't know why they add cheese, but I would ask them to refrain. It is terrific. Their matzoh ball soup is one of the best I have had. The broth is superb. Not too chickeny, although the cup contains a bounty of carrots and celery, the soup is not overpowered in their flavor. The matzoh ball has the perfect density.\n\nIf you are in for breakfast, try the breakfast skins, but make sure you have about 8 people with you to eat these. Another novel take on something which has become so common, potato skins. Who would have thought about taking a bagel, topping it with scrambled eggs, potatoes, cheese, onions, sour cream.

I got up to take a walk over to the bakery, while our food was being prepared.  The manager, who was on duty that night, came up to my husband at our table and basically shoved the menu in HIS face to show him where it said there was an additional charge for kaiser rolls.  So when I got back from the table, he pointed it out to me. I then, took it upon myself to go up to the manager AND the server and I told them I was sorry, I wasn't trying to be petty, but my husband showed me where it said the additional charge on the menu. I apologized and told them I just couldn't find it, since it wasn't THAT obvious.  Well the freakin manager LAUGHED at me after I apologized!  Are you KIDDING me?

The tables were all set up on the patio  but apparently the server did not want us to eat outside because she was training someone and it would make it harder.  Our hostess went and asked another server, who also was not able or willing to serve us outside.  So, our options were to eat inside or to get it as takeout and sit out on one of the picnic-like tables outside without service.  We elected for the takeout, even though it was not the most convenient thing in the world to juggle the food with a toddler clinging to my leg.\n\nWhen I went to pay for the takeout, I was charged for the Kids Meal, too.  I brought up the \"Kids Eat Free\" and she said that was only for dining in, but she would ask the manager because of our circumstance.  She came back and said no, that the Kids Meal would not be free.  I think she was actually trying, the only person there I can say that about.\n\nBy that point, I was so annoyed that we went to Sprouts, got some nice, fresh strawberries, and went home, made our own sandwiches and opened a can of soup.

Okay fine- maybe it was important. \n\n2nd attempt: Thought to myself \"Let's try this again\" a week later. Walked in and it was fairly quiet and the lady up front was so incredibly rude and upset by something clearly going on in her life. Rolled her eyes when I tried to customize my order and handed me my bag. I couldn't run out fast enough. When I got to my desk she didn't even add what I wanted to my order (toasted bagel with egg... Not that hard). \n\n3rd attempt: Shockingly- I decided I would throw them a bone in hopes for a better experience. \"3rd times the charm\"?? Nope! Walked in and waited... And waited... And waited. No one was in line but me. It's fine if you are busy just say \"I will be right with you\". \n\nHow does this place stay in business?", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "A great way to escape the Arizona heat and a great chance to practice your New York accent.

The woman explained how they could do this and the manager just didn't listen. The couple left without getting their food. \n\nNow it was our turn. My daughter likes cinnamon & raisin and I like cinnamon & sugar. They didn't have either, and then I noticed they didn't have many others. There was very little variety there, and I was disappointed. (Einstein's always has people making more. I didn't see anyone making anything!!!) The manager said she could have the worker wipe butter all over a plain bagel and then pure cinnamon and sugar all over it. I was a little annoyed since they only had like 5 different sorts, so I told them to make it. The worker had no idea and tried to smather butter all over my bagel and then run sugar into the cream cheese I ordered. Terrible. Really worried. \n\nI got my daughter a plain bagel with cream cheese and hoped it would be ok. Really boring and not what she wanted. (They had nothing near what she liked). She was excited to stop to get \"doggie bagels\" for our puppy, so we asked for these. The guy looked at us like we were from Mars. He said snootily that they didn't have them. I know Einstein's does. I asked if he had anything like this that my kid could feed her dog and he was nasty to us. He told us NO and took our money. Gave us our change, didn't bother to cut our bagels at all, and I was really annoyed and will not go back.\n\nSkip this Bruegger's completely. GO TO EINSTEIN'S!!!

Today was my third visit. I had a toasted spinach bagel with egg and cheese-yummy. I was sitting on the front patio when I noticed a bird struggling in a high branch of the palo verde tree nearest the building. The little sparrow had it's foot caught on the branch and was hanging upside down. It would flutter it's wings valiantly every few minutes trying to right itself, then hang helpless again. I wanted to help, but it was so high up I knew I couldn't climb all the way up. One of the staff members came out to see if everyone was happy so I pointed out the little bird and asked her if they had a long pole of some kind. She went back inside and came out with a ladder and a broom. So she set up the ladder and I was preparing to climb up with the broom stick to see if I could help free the bird.  Meanwhile everyone on the patio and passing by had stopped to see what was happening. I was about to climb up when another staff member came out to assess the situation. He quickly came up with a better solution and disappeared inside. Shortly he returned with an extendable pole that would easily reach the sparrow. After gently trying to nudge the bird free we all realized the entaglement was more serious. This kind man climbed the tree and with the help of another volunteer on the ground pulled the branch close enough to reach. He then gently captured the bird and brought it down. Both of its feet were badly tangled with some sortof stringy moss. The bird's thrashing had twisted ithe string so badly he would surely have died before breaking free. Everyone helped to untangle his feet and then we set the tiny sparrow free.

They are HUGE, rolled and baked fresh on the daily, and strike the perfect balance between soft, chewy, and crispy when toasted. They don't skimp on anything, and I never feel like I just got robbed after eating here. The cream cheese assortment is awesome and each one I've tried is amazing! My go-to breakfast bagel is sausage, egg, and cheese on an everything. YUM. And if I have a sweet tooth, the cinnamon raisin bagel with the walnut raisin cream cheese will do the trick every time.

Follow my adventure...\n\nI actually didn't know this place existed until the Groupon deal came up recently.  I Yelp'ed the place and saw how well rated it was, so I picked up the $20 for $10 deal.  The place is only open 7am-3pm, though, and I'm rarely awake during those hours, so I wasn't sure when I could use it.  My sleep schedule flipped over today, though, so 7am was around mid-day for me.\n\nI walked in and was instantly greeted by the girl that worked there, damn I can't believe I'm forgetting her name.  I asked what was good for breakfast, and she said the grill was on and she was making breakfast sandwiches on a bagel.  SOLD!\n\n\"What kind of bagel would you like?\"  \"Sesame.\"\n\"How would you like your eggs?\" \"Umm.... (eggs are eggs)  Surprise me!\"\n\n** I lose a lot of servers here, as they're afraid to bring me something I didn't order, but she was up for the challenge.\n\n\"What kind of cheese would you like?\" \"Umm... (challenge accepted!)   Surprise me!\"\n\"Do you want to add ham, bacon, or sausage?\"  \"Yes.  Surprise me!\"\n\nNot scared in the slightest, she asked if I wanted a specialty coffee drink.  This I'm a little more picky about, so I ordered a vanilla latte.\n\nShe went to ring me up to pay, but I asked her not to, yet, since I had the Groupon and planned to figure out what else to buy while I ate.  No problems with that request either.\n\nWhile I waited for my food, I looked over the menu and realized just how little I had spent so far.  Bagel sandwich was like $3.50, add meat for $1.25, and a vanilla latte was like $3.00.  She showed up with a huge, delicious beverage while I figured out my plan to burn off the rest of the Groupon.\n\nThe waitress showed up with a breakfast sandwich pretty quickly, and I was about to dive in when she asked me if I wanted to know what it was.  Sure.  Eggs over hard.  Muenster cheese.  Sausage.   She seemed proud of the combination, and I can't blame her as it was great.  This ain't no McDonald's breakfast.  And Bagel Cafe has nothing on the speed at Bobby's.\n\nAfter my meal, I discussed my options.  I ended up with a half dozen of assorted bagels (3 sesame, 2 cinnamon, 1 oat), 1 small tub of nova cream cheese, 1 small tub of tuna salad, and 1 small tub of chopped liver for the ex.  I think I ended up paying like $1 or $2 over my Groupon after all that.\n\nHere I am, 12 hours later, eating my second bagel.  Cinnamon bagel was a nice dessert/snack, but the toasted sesame seed bagel with the nova cream cheese on top is sooooo good.  This CRUSHES Bagel Cafe's nova cream cheese.  Bobby's has huge chunks of salmon, and it tastes amazing.\n\nGood food, really friendly staff, great prices, there's not a lot to dislike about Bobby's other than their hours.  Sadly, I will likely not get to enjoy Bobby's very often.\n\nOh yeah, keep your eyes on LivingSocial this week... a little birdie told me they're running a $4 for $10 promotion for Bobby's, so you can try it out AND not feel like a glutton buying everything in the store like I did!\n\nOh yeah part 2, I'm sorry Bobby that owns Bobby's, but the video I posted below is Internet comedy gold.

When the plate arrived, I looked down to see a rather large portioned omelet that was stiff, fairly hard, smooth sided, compacted and in the shape of a triangle.  I immediately compared it to the looks of a tan colored cranberry scone.  There was no evidence of a yellow or egg whites.  It was all overcooked and brown.  If it wasn't for the triangular shape i'd say it looked like it was baked too long in a shoe.  yes, the texture while eating it was exactly as it looked.  Rubbery and flakey. Brown.  The omelet came with a bagel and diced potatoes.  The bagel:  Nothing special AT ALL.  It's not like you are going to Einstein's bagels or anywhere of that caliber.  It was not extra tasty or extra large.  I was surprised at that for a bagel shop!!  I usually love hash browns or other types of breakfast potatoes.  Not this time.  These diced potatoes were mushy and sticky in a weird kind of way.

With tax my total bill was $16.48 not counting a tip.  If the pastrami omelet was not the most expensive item on the menu, it was right up there.  So yes, you could very easily get your entr\u00e9e $3 cheaper.

That ended on the playground.. and as a adult, it is NOT OK to be bullied out of your rights! \"She grabbed her calculator and started to try to figure out what she would have to refund and it seemed as if it was either (or both) that it hurt her to figure it out because it was too hard, or she realized that she would be losing cash in hand and all she had to do was fix my order (I mean how many bagels gets thrown away in a day anyway just fix the sandwich) \n\nShe finally understood that I wasn't leaving and that she either had to make my food over or refund me the money.

Jersey is not and never will be NYC. And I don't know where the rest of you are from in NY. Long Island perhaps? Buffalo maybe? Those are NOT NY bagels. Again, as in the pizza.
