Below you can read my original review.\n\nMy wife and I were looking for a new place to try for breakfast. I found Bon Chef Cafe and decided to check it out. \nThere were some nice looking pastries in the display case. We were seated quickly, and got our drinks quickly but that's about the best of it.\nIt took awhile for the server to get back to us to take our order. We both ordered chicken fried steak. The price was $9.99 for the chicken fried steak. My wife ordered egg substitute, I ordered eggs over medium. About ten minutes had passed when the server came back to the table with a menu to inform us that eggs weren't included with the breakfast. What? Since when are eggs not part of a breakfast? And why did it take 10 minutes to let us know? We paid for our coffee and left. \nThe menu is confusing, and the offerings are pretty standard. The other reviews rave how it's so nice to have a chef making the food. And there's definitely a man in a chef's coat working there.

Yup, all this food for the bargain price of $50!\n\nWith a curious and rambunctious 10-month-old baby, dining out is challenging. When we saw other families with kids and the cute little play area, we knew we wouldn't be looked at with disdain if our baby would randomly let out a Pterodactyl shriek (which is his newest favorite thing to do). There was an old couple next to us that ignored our baby who kept waving and smiling at them but I understand not all people like kids. The owners and servers were friendly with our baby and that's all that mattered.\n\nEverything we were served from the first course to dessert was delightful. The stars of the meal were the rich and cheesy French Onion Soup and the light and fluffy Tiramisu. I ordered my steak medium, and it came out pretty well done. Not a big deal though since my shrimp scampi was delicious as was everything else on the menu. Their kitchen has an open layout so you can see all the action.\n\nEven though it was a special menu, several items are available on their regular menu. I'm dying to go back to try their Baked Lobster Bisque and their breakfast offerings.

The photo on Yelp of their Caprese salad was tempting me, browsed through other pictures, everything looked visually appealing as well. So made the decision to have lunch here and Im very happy I did!\n\nThe food Ive tried so far rocks! Caprese Salad and their Beef Kebabs was my order.\n\nCaprese Salad - Layered with fresh mozz, grilled eggplant and ripe tomatoes and sprinkled with basil. Loved it. The cheese was fresh, creamy and tender. Real simple salad but delish!\n\nBeef Kebabs - There was an option for beef kebabs as a wrap or combo plate with veggies and ricel pilaf. I chose the combo of healthy proteins, starches and veggies.  Beef kebabs were nice thick chunky cuts of nicely seasoned beef that are fired grilled. It also came with a Tahini sauce that was made from scratch for dipping. Loved it! The portion sizes are average and fit the prices they charge which is moderate. Both dishes I had were under $10 each. Which is pretty affordable for the specialties they offer here.\n\nAmbiance/Service - Delightful describes my dining experience!! It's a relaxed feel where Frank Sinatra and 40's tunes are piped in. Cherry-wood tables and chairs. Natural light filters in through the floor to ceiling windows that surround the place. Love the hand painted wall art. How sweet and thoughtful they have a little area dedicated for the little ones to dine/play too, so moms (and or dads ) can relax and unwind a bit with a glass of wine.  \n\nIt's a family owned business. The host/server that initially seated me was at the end of her shift, so Albert and Tony took over and did a great job! I also had the pleasure to meet the Chef Ash and the Bon Chef Cafe crew.

It's hard to describe the menu, because there is quite a variety, from your standard lunch fare to many other interesting items.This time-Pastrami sandwich. This was some of the best pastrami I have ever had, fat free, and piled on nice and thick. Also, Chicken Noodle soup. Once again, as chicken noodle goes, this was about as good as it gets. Do yourself a favor a check this place out. Our waitress was very friendly and there when we needed attention, nice job. There is plenty more on the menu I want to try and will be back. This place deserves to be on your list too!\n\n\nChecked out this new place as I like to do. Very nice remodel/cleanup of what was a pretty beat Sushi Factory before. So kudos there. From a service standpoint this was a weak spot. Nothing happenned very quickly, and getting the check seemed like it was never going to happen. When we did get it we were charged for 2 coffees even though we only had one, but I was so tired of waiting I just paid it. Now for the food. It was breakfast, and the menu is fairly basic in that regard. What I would change---the bacon is very thin and narrow, although the sausage was good. I hope they change their bacon---Peg's in Reno is one place that gives you a real piece of bacon. Also, the ham in the omelet looked like a slice lunch ham cut into little pieces---would be better to dice pieces off a real ham--it just makes things better and higher quality. Also, the hashbrowns were kind of a formed, wet lump---there are better ways to prepare browns. All else was good. The lunch/dinner menu looks good, real good. If we go back, it will likely be for one of those. Some very inteesting choices.

Outstanding!  They also have a play area that has tons of cars and other toys for the kids to have fun!  This is a very kids friendly restaurant, with excellent food!\n\nThe highlights of the night were the lobster bisque, which was the best I've had.

And the little baked pastry had a nice chunk of lobster hiding in it! Awesome and fun surprise!  I would definitely order the full size next time I am here.\n\nMy other favorite of the night was the steak pyramid, which this is only a miniature version of....They said they marinate the meat overnight so it gets all the flavors and goodies to absorb inside the meat, and then they cook it with love! Super yummy, and I would definitely recommend it!  Probably the biggest reason besides the hospitality that I will be back!\n\nOther goodies like the chicken florentine, Shrimp Scampi in lemon butter sauce, and Chocolate Dipped Strawberries & Petite Fours and Truffles all get honorable mentions!

After reading all the wonderful reviews, I really wanted dine here.  I love and support local business and was so excited.  I was absolutely disappointed with my experience here.\n\nThe restaurant itself is adorable.  It is cozy, allows a lot of natural lighting, and quaintly decorated.  I was so excited to be there.\n\nThe service was absolutely subpar.  Our server (I never got her name because she never introduced herself to us) was very impersonal.  Neither of us once got the feeling we were welcomed there or that our patronage was appreciated.  \n\nAfter reading rave reviews about the baked lobster bisque topped with a puff pastry, I was so excited to try it.  I was told there would be a 15 minute wait for it, but good things come to those who wait, right?  My friend ordered the steak pyramid.\n\nWe drank all our water and our glasses remained empty until the time we got our food.  So, for over 15 minutes we waited with no water to drink while there was only one other couple in the restaurant.  I overheard the other couple trying to order an alcoholic beverage.  The server seemed perplexed as to their own drink menu and the gentleman had to point out on the drink menu what he wanted to order.\n\nWhen our food finally arrived, I still had high hopes.  Here was an opportunity for recovery.  Unfortunately, everything fell flat.  The puff pasty is messy when you break it into the soup.  The flakes kind of fall everywhere.  This wouldn't be a problem, but the soup is served in a little bowl on a little saucer, so pastry flakes went all over the table.  Even my friend's plate seemed too small for his dish and rice (even though he ordered fries) fell on the table.  And I swear neither of us are messy eaters.  \n\nWe brought to their attention the error in my friend's order and that was remedied, but it felt like we bothered them to get the side we had ordered in the first place. \n\nThe lobster bisque was just disappointing.  When I think of lobster bisque, I think of creamy, orangey soup with thick chunks of delicious lobster in it.  This bisque was liquidy, greyish orange (there were visible oil beads separated from the rest of the base floating on the surface) with 3 small pieces of lobster in it.  I couldn't bring myself to eat the whole thing.\n\nThe steak pyramid was just okay.  There were only 3 small pieces of actual steak in the tall pyramid that we determined was primarily made of onion rings. My friend asked for it medium rare.  It was definitely medium well. It looked nothing like the other Yelp pictures. Another disappointment.\n\nWe were both obviously done dinning for awhile and sat in sheer disappointment as we waited over 10 minutes for our bill.  I still have no idea what our server was doing because as I stated, there were only 2 couples in the restaurant.\n\nAs a small business, it is imperative to be proactive in customer satisfaction. I know the owners actually read these reviews as I see recovery responses to the negative reviews on here.  But if your employees actually paid attention to your customers while they were at the restaurant, it would never get to this point.\n\nThe service absolutely needs refinement.  I am not expecting to be catered to, but I expect to be treated with respect and as though I am appreciated as a customer.  Never once did our server \"talk\" to us or even ask how we were doing.

I wanted to show my support for her first UYE, but knew I was going to be out of town that day.  Sorry Shirley B!!\n\nAll was not lost though.  Coincidentally, Terri R brought up that we need to try Bon Chef before we start to get serious with our training.  I was thinking the same thing.  And you know what would make dinner at Bon Chef even better...that's dinner with Shirley B herself.  So it's on!!! Terri R contacted Shirley B, I contacted Ian A, and my other favorite twin Alicia R also made the dinner.  Just from the line up, I already knew a great meal was ahead of us. We arrived at the same time and was greeted with open arms from Chef Ash and Team Bon Chef.  Chef Ash noticed that we had Shirley with us and stated \"Tonight, you will be treated like Kings and Queens\".  All this special treatment just because we had the Duchess with us.  First impression...5 stars Homie. And by the way, I'm the Duke of In-N-Out in case you wanted to know.  \n\nNow let's take a look at the menu. First review off the menu was immediate delight.  Everything on the menu was decently price, okay it was cheap.  Everyone got something different, but we all shared the pita and hummus.  This was so addicting that even with two orders on the table, an extra order was made.  I ended up getting their Tilapia a la francaise, which is their tilapia filet, egg battered in lemon and white wine sauce.  Not what you're thinking with this one.  They hooked this bad boy up.  The dish came with rice, some greens that I never eat, and 3 well portioned filets of tilapia.  This was so deliciously made, flaky, and was complimented perfectly with their egg battered lemon/wine sauce.  About 10 oz of great tasting tilapia for less than $12 is a steal.  Obviously, I was not disappointed with my first visit to Bon Chef Cafe.\n\nOnce our meal as done and the bill was paid, Chef Ash brought over some complimentary Baklava for dessert.  I guess when you dine with the Duchess, you truly are treated like Kings.  Thank you Chef Ash.  Thank you Shirley B.  \n\nPS:  Read the reviews. Great service is given to everyone here.  You don't need to have the Duchess with you for a superb experience.  But it sure doesn't hurt. \n\nQuestion for Shirley B:  Who's got it better than us???  \n\nTilapia a la francaise:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=XpXtyXo3q0QC5IC8nFdOhA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nBaklava: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=hyC9TYvDDZH8div7ZdJrDA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 7, "useful": 11, "cool": 7}}, {"text": "Definitely a regular here for a few reasons.

It had very generous portions of mussels, clams, shrimp, crawfish, tilapia, portuguese sausage, scallops and calamari and it was just spicy enough to be interesting but not too hot.

We wanted to try the Buffalo Wings since those are my husbands favorite  food.  After the waiter brought our drinks we ordered those as we were still deciding on our lunch to order.  Shortly after we placed our lunch order.  I went with the Club with soup instead of fries.  My husband ordered the Cajun Chicken Sandwich. In a little bit my tomato basil soup was brought out before the meal (not with my sandwich).  We thought this was strange that we hadn't got our wings yet.  Hmm...   But I was giving them the benefit of the doubt thinking the soup was already prepared and the wings needed a little more time.  The soup was luke warm at best.  It did have a good flavor but would have been better hot as intended.   \n\nTick tock, tick tock, tick tock....   About 35 minutes passed before our sandwiches were brought out.  With no other meals being prepared except ours, I was surprised it took this long to bring us our meal.  I will say my sandwich was stacked with the meat. I wasn't going to complain about that.  But does it really take that long to put together a deli style sandwich? My husbands cajun chicken was just ok.  (I had a little taste).  And still no chicken wings.  Oh well.  \n\nLike I said, I really wanted them to be a 5 star review but I just can't do it with our dining experience.   I know there are yelpers out there that love this place.

For anyone who loves cold potatoes and ricotta cheese it would be the bomb but I'm not a big fan... that's not to say it wasn't good... it's just not the type of food I prefer. The lamb shank was big and came on a bed of the same pasta sauce that the meatballs came with (on the appetizer)\n\nThe service was great and the waiter was courteous and talkative.

I'd been wanting to try it ever since it opened, so much so that it became a running joke between me and my dining partner in crime (henceforth PIC) that I would always suggest \"Bon Chef?\" as an option when asked where we should eat.   This continued for the last 6-8 months with nary a single visit.  When the PIC actually brought it up as a serious suggestion to eat dinner last week, I almost hesitated for fear of losing this running joke.   In the end I agreed we should finally try it and off we went.\n\nWe started with some beers which seemed to take a while to be delivered.  They had a decent selection of bottles to choose from, but after ordering the wait got to the point where I was looking around and annoyingly asking the PIC \"Where the hell are our beers?\"  Then, refills had to be requested by flagging down our server 5 minutes after my glass sat empty, and my PIC who ordered a Guinness was told upon trying to order another that they were out.   Not a huge deal and they supplanted it with another German dark beer, but a mild annoyance.\n\nI'd been craving (and missing) Hedary's lentil soup for some time now, and when I saw Lentil Soup on the menu here I had to order it.   It was decent.   Lentil soups from my experience vary wildly from restaurant to restaurant and this one neither pleased nor displeased me.   Not something I'd rush to order again but I wouldn't push it away if presented it either.\n\nAs for the entrees my PIC got the steak Pyramid which I'd been hyping up since Bon Chef opened, and I went with the Mixed Grill because I always tend to order plates with way too much food (this boasted chicken, beef, kofta, and a pork chop over rice).   In the end I have to say I was very disappointed with my dish.   I ordered my beef to be done \"medium\" and felt that ALL the meat came out medium-well to well.   Most of it was dry and tough and lacked seasoning.  The one exception was the Kofta, which I thought had a great flavor and didn't seem as dry as the others.   The rice that accompanied it was fine, but I've certainly had better at other Mediterranean restaurants I frequent (shout out to Stephanos and Fat Greek).   My PIC's steak pyramid was much better, perhaps because she had the wherewithal to go medium rare on the cook.   Her steak was juicier and more tender than mine, though the flavor on it due to the marinade they used wasn't something that I liked much.   She was a fan though.   Unfortunately I'm writing this review and not her.  \n\nFor food alone I would have probably gone with a 3 if everything else was perfect, but with the slow service on getting drinks and refills, the one bottle of Guinness caper, as well as what I feel are slightly high prices for what you get in return, the end result is a 2.

It's homemade tasting, thick, dense, with little chunks of sweet potato throughout and the just right amount of spices, you can tell the crust is also handmade.

The two employees had no clue what flavor today's tea was, but pointed out there was more sugar available if it was needed. Dumping the tea out, I went back to the standard Dr Pepper and crunchy ice.\n\nI was unsure how a Mac & Cheese place would handle the dish as a 'fast food' type establishment, or like a sit down restaurant. Turns out, more like a pre-made, fast food establishment. Two large chaffing dishes kept some macaroni with a cheese mixture warmed, awaiting a spoon to transfer it into the customer's container before the mix ins are added and put in the oven to melt the top cheese and heat up the entire dish.\n\nWe received our food and gave it a moment to cool down, the cheese was nice and melted, however, as certain cheeses are known to, the cheese formed a solid brick of cheese mix over the noodles.

I really hate the trend in the service/retail industry right now that requires the workers to holler out across the entire establishment, \"WELCOME TO _____!!!! CAN I HELP YOU TODAY!??\" I mean, we're in a building the size of a household living room, there's no need to bellow. But I digress. We looked over the menu, and picked two Lil Mac (kids' size), which includes, and I quote, \"1 Mix-In.\" Thinking that the mix-in that was included was listed underneath the menu section called \"Mix-Ins,\" I selected spinach for my mix-in. I also selected Dorito topping for my mac. Later, I realized I had been charged for spinach, and I asked why. Apparently, a Dorito topping is also a mix-in, even though the menu makes it look like the topping is included. Be mindful of this when ordering!\n\nIt's important to note that Mix N Mac is in the style of Panera or Chipotle, just with macaroni and cheese. Quick service, but not drive-thru. We placed our order at 11:52 (according to the timestamp on our receipt). For 15 minutes or more, no one was working on our food. There was a woman stirring a cauldron of cheese sauce, one teenage boy standing at the register for customers that weren't there, and another was chopping up meat that I knew couldn't be for our meal because we did not order meat in our Macs. I had an appointment to get to, so at this time I asked for it to go. \n\nAt this point is when all hell broke loose. A storm of people came in, all the while the woman stirring the cauldron of cheese without helping the two teenagers prepare food, and they aren't even really doing that. My mac and cheese arrived around 12:20, and I had a few bites. It was, to be honest, slightly fishy like another reviewer had said. There wasn't so much as cheese flavor as it was cheesy-fish flavor. There was hardly any spinach that I had paid extra for due to the confusing menu, and I couldn't even taste the Dorito topping. \n\nThe key part of the paragraph above is that I got my order, but my mom's was mysteriously not arriving with mine. The people who ordered 10 minutes after me and my mom got their food before she did. I was going to be late for this appointment, so she ran out with it in a to-go bag. At 12:31, we left this quick-service mac and cheese establishment not having even sat down to eat. \n\nI will give it another try in a few months, once they get a chain of command worked out and realize that prep work like stirring the cauldron of cheese and chopping meats should not be done during high lunch time. I feel really bad leaving such a bad review, but this place was not worth our 40 minutes or our $15.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 10, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "Not good at all!

It's not BAD, it's just not mac n cheezy.  No tang! No cheezy flavor.  I took mine home and added cheezed it up (seriously, 1 TBS of Nooch (aka nutritional yeast aka vegan gold) made a WORLD of difference), and it was quite good.  The Vegan includes whole wheat noodles, and a few types of veg in a creamy sauce.    You can also get the \"Vegan\" with regular cheese if you want, which people at the counter kept telling me.  They seemed to know that the vegan was not so tasty as-is.  That's sad, because it's actually really easy (and cheap) to make a GOOD vegan mac.

A place that specializes in Mac-n-Cheese..... what a great idea!  However, this place was awful-despite its promising concept. \n\nLet's start off with the basic Mac-n-Cheese which my 3 year old son tried ($4.99 for an individual serving).  What Mix N Mac didn't know was that my son is somewhat of a Mac-N-Cheese expert. This basic dish tasted like overcooked bland noodles with a hint of cheese flavor. Our Verdict: Bland/ Overcooked/ Overpriced!\n\nI opted for the Mexi-Mac. Ground beef, chorizo, jalapenos, cilantro, and tortillas all mixed in with Mac-N-Cheese. Sign me up-- sounds great! Not bad, but the portion size was ridiculous. I felt like I was served a side dish. Wait, is there more? Is there a hamburger that is supposed to come with this tiny baby serving? Our verdict: Good Flavors/Small Portion/Overpriced!\n\nMy wife ordered the Brisket sandwich. This sloppy meat like substance tasted really sweet and was served on what I could only imagine was day old bread. You know the kind of bread you could pick up at the .99 store. Served with potato chips, this was not a winner. Our Verdict: Sweet/Gooey/Not Good!\n\nBottom line, this was not a good dining experience. Don't even get me started on their furniture and soda fountain. OK --now I am started. Their furniture was cheap, wobbly and a blinding orange in color. Their soda fountain was messed up with drinks coming out barely carbonated. I mentioned this to one of the workers, and she was able to fix the problem while we were eating.

Actually it was a review from Elite Yelper and fellow Internet foodie friend Shirley B. that really got me here. A good little location with not so great decor. I have a lot to say about this place so I apologize for my lengthy review. \nFirst, I had already checked out the menu via yelp, and had an idea of what I wanted. They have custom mac& chz where you choose your mix-ins and cheese flavor. Or you can go with the choices they have like \"Spicy mac\" with hot links and jalape\u00f1os or a plain \"cheesy mac\" with different flavor cheeses. They also have sandwich and salad selections. \nMy daughter got a basic cheddar & bacon mac. She enjoyed it. I tasted it, approved. Bacon wasn't mushy and the mac had a nice crisp cheese crust. \nI ordered a custom mac with cheddar, roasted peppers, crushed red peppers, and mushrooms. (Totally stole the idea from Shirley B. and added the crushed) I truly enjoyed it and would return for this item. HOWEVER, a big thing when going out to eat is WHAT IS SPECIAL ABOUT THIS? Really, nothing. I could do it at home and probably better. Was it good, sure. But for $7 it should come with bread and a drink IMO. \nMy boyfriend go the spicy mac. Good concept adding the hot links and it was for sure spicy. I again liked it, but it didn't OMG AMAZE me. \nNow the bad. Well NONE of it was BAD, let me rephrase that, for the just ok, average, maybe not so great parts. The hotlink/meatball sandwich. Um, no. Usually when I think hotlink, I expect spice, not sweet. This has a homemade BBQ sauce that was just gross to me. Almost reminded me of sweet Swedish meatballs. Not something you'd mix with a hotlink I'd think. \nThe ingredients were fresh, but I just did not like the flavor. \nSecondly for the negatives, the service. There was a young girl at the counter who was clearly overwhelmed or under trained. Possibly both. She was sweet, but not genuine. Then when we left it seemed maybe the boss lady had arrived. She was checking on guests, had great customer service, and said bye as we left. The other guy behind the counter (who made and handed out our food) wasn't rude by any means, but he was not kind either. For a newer restaurant business they should be basically shouting smiles at customers.

The Groupon offered the full menu range.  I decided ahead of time to just go with a mac dish to take to our Thanksgiving dinner we were having a week in advance for out of town family.  I let all the family know that I would be bringing this \"delicious\" deal from Groupon.  Well, I arrived at the Galleria Mall and asked 4 different people if they new where the Mix N Mac was located, as I couldn't find them on any mall kiosk.  Nobody knew until I hailed a bicycling security guard.  He informed me they were actually located on the outer ring, next to Panera.  So back around the Galleria to find the Panera, but no sinage for a Mix N Mac.  This search had already taken me 15 minutes, and since I got there and didn't see any signs, I figured they must have closed the business already.  But it seemed odd as the security guard seemed sure they were there, so I slowly inched my way along the strip area next to Panera and finally found the door with a Mix N Mac sign, but no lights on at 9:45 am.  Hmmmm, not a good indicator of business.  But still wanting to get mac n chees for the family, I parked and went to the front door.  I found a hand written sign that stated they had new hours and opened at 11:00 am.  Are you kidding?  I knew right away that business wasn't doing well, plus I didn't have time to wait, we were having Thanksgiving dinner at 11:00.  So I went to my sisters and let all the family and guests know about the problem with Mix N Mac.  We all agreed that starting a business in these times is rough and Mix N Mac probably would not last a year.  But my husband and I decided to use our Groupon the next evening, instead of cooking.  Well, when we got there they had two customers.  I smiled and asked what they would recommend?  They said it was their first time, but they looked a bit grim and didn't recommend what they had ordered.  Uh oh, so I turned to the friendly looking cashier and asked what she ordered when she ate there.  She looked down at the keyboard and had to think hard...lol.  She finally said the cheese sandwich, because it had fresh veggies.  So, I said, \"That sounds delicious, let me order one of those.\"  Then I asked my husband what he would like.  Just as he was thinking aloud, a girl came out from the back kitchen and saw that I had a piece of paper in my hand with the Groupon in bold letters.  She said, in a rude, nasty tone, \"You can only order a mac and cheese with the Groupon!\"  \"Excuse me,\" I said, totally afronted by her attitude.  \"That's what our owners said,\" she stated briskly.  Hmmm.  She then explained, \"I know it doesn't say that on the Groupon, but that's what our owners decided after selling so many Groupons.  So that's all you can get.\"  Hmmm, after more discussion about Groupon and how it brings people in to try an establishment and gain loyal customers, my husband and I decided to leave and contact Groupon for a refund.  I know this is long winded, and we didn't even try the mac and cheese, but customer service is a vital area that ensures return, repeat business.  I don't ever go back where customer service is unpleasant, and I probably tell at least 10 of my friends and relatives, if not more.  I think I did mention it to our friendly waitress at the IHOP who's husband is a taxi driver in Vegas.  So, you can imagine how the word will spread about our negative experience at Mix N Mac.

I ordered the Cheesy Mac and it was okay--the best part was the blue cheese hidden inside, but the rest didn't smack of the cheesy flavor I crave in a mac and cheese!\n\nI can't say that I'll be back again, not because of anything other than some new dietary restrictions, but I am bumping it up from 2 to 3 stars.

It's like Chipotle, but with mac and cheese.  Already off to a good start in my book.  The Living Social certificate was also a good incentive to head on over.\n\nThe menu consists of two sections - pre-defined creations or a list of items so you can make a custom mac.  I opted for the pre-defined Mex Mac.  Jalepenos, chorizo, ground beef, and tortilla chips.  DC opted for a custom - mushrooms and bacon with whole wheat noodles.  I was a little skeptical about this notion of pre-made mac and cheese, but they have a good set up.  The noodles are separate from the bechamel and the mix-ins.  Everything is mixed together when you order it, and then popped in the oven to get bubbly and gooey.\n\nBoth iterations came out of the oven with a baked crust of cheese.  They were hot and steaming and really hearty.  The cheese could use some more seasoning, but the mix-ins really added a lot.  The Mex Mac was loaded with flavor and spice, and the custom mac was pretty good too.\n\nOverall, the pricing was decent for the amount of food, and the flavor was good.  The atmosphere inside was kind of bland and could use a little sprucing up or some color.  \n\nI dont think I would go out of my way to come here, but if I am in the area I will definitely stop by.

The Bayou Mac for $9.49 doesn't even come close to filling me (although it might suffice at lunch), and they're definitely skimping at least a little on the crab and crawfish.

Oh, and Doritos crumbles on the top really added to the mac and cheese as well.\n\nWhat was so good?  Macaroni that is tender but not limp, lots of cheese with creamy consistency, and finished in an oven so there's a bit of burned cheese on top.

I'm willing to give it that excuse because both the service and the food were quite good.  Their rice and beans aren't anything to write home about, but they weren't so bad that it took away from the meal.  \n\nMy only negative, and this could be why there were fewer folks, is that not only do they have a pretty limited lunch menu, with much smaller portions, but they aren't really \"lunch special\" prices.  Their lunch menu ran from $7-10 with most things $8-9.  Considering the full sized meals with more options were available for just $1-$2 more, why not get the larger size and a doggie bag for dinner?  \n\nNot a bad spot, but didn't exactly rock my world either.

They even have a Monte Cristo ($5.15) on their menu! And their basics are great.  I had the Tuna melt ($5.05) on an employee's recommendation and it's one of the best one's I've had in a long time.

Sure - when I saw I could get Hires Root Beer or Squirt with my lunch, I was stoked.  But then I saw their coffee menu.  How about a large (32oz) Iced Coffee for $2.25?

I checked yelp for restaurants that were currently open nearby and thankfully discovered the Morning Star Cafe. It is in a mostly industrial location that you would never just \"stumble upon\".  We walked in to a very cute cafe and were immediately greeted by the owner, offered coffee and given a menu. It was about 10 am, but neither one of us really wanted breakfast and asked if we could get one of the sandwiches offered. No problem at all, order anything you want! So, I ordered a turkey on rye, my husband got a muffaletta. \n\nWhile we were waiting, the owner chatted us up a bit, asked a few questions, discovered that we were from out of town. She told us about her favorite places in AZ and even brought over some of her favorite magazines outlining things to do in the area (we are already planning our next trip back!). Very friendly! I can't even comprehend the complaints about the service being nil. There were a couple of other tables and each was treated with the same warm service that we were.\n\nOur food came, and it was delicious. It is kind of hard to make something fantastic out of the common turkey sandwich, but they pull it off. The bread is about an inch thick, perfectly fresh and soft (delivered nightly by a company just a couple buildings down as told to us by the owner), lots of fresh veggies are offered with the turkey (to order, of course). My husband's muffaletta was perfect. Just the right about of olive salad. The coffee was fantastic too (as others have mentioned). As we were paying our bill (which was very reasonable), the owner gave us a little bag with a couple of their fresh muffins to enjoy on the plane since she knew we were headed out! One blueberry and one cinnamon, they were a perfect mid-flight snack. \n\nSo, I would hands down recommend Morning Star Cafe. This is the sort of place that I would visit on the regular if I lived locally. I am sure that I would be greeted by name and be handed a warm cup of coffee as I came in the door, it is that type of place. I love the fact that it is family owned, they have a guest book which starts with an entry detailing that this cafe has been a long time dream of theirs and describing all of the work putting the place together.  The cute decor was done by their friends and family, rewarded by home cooked meals .

I ordered the Monte Cristo with a side of bacon.\n\nThe food is probably closer to 3.5-4 stars.  The Monte Cristo was actually really, really good - probably one of the best I've ever had.  It was perfectly sweet and just a bit savory and very fresh.  The bacon was good too, though just a hair under how I like mine cooked.\n\nThey brag about having some of the best coffee in town.  Nope.  It's crap.  I mean, we're not talking about drive-thru coffee, but it's at best standard diner coffee.  Two stars on the Joe.\n\nPrices were average.\n\nThe ambiance, at least for me, is a one star.  Maybe 1.5 if I'm feeling generous.  I can't decide if it felt like I was eating at an old lady's house or a church waiting room.  The place is Jesused-out.  I'm not religious, but I don't really mind religion either - I just don't like sitting down to Coffee with Christ.  The whole meal felt like it was served in the green room for the 700 Club.  I guess that shouldn't have surprised me since the restaurant's website links to RBC Ministries.  The whole thing was just way too overbearing to be cozy at all.  Even my super-religious friends would probably wonder where the restaurant was.  Between that and the constant interruptions from the staff, my working breakfast was thoroughly thwarted.\n\nBasically, really good food, meh-to-blah coffee, and a very uncomfortable dining room.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "One of the things Boyfriend and I try to do when we're on vacation is to find local restaurants to try out. I mean, what's the point of hitting up a chain restaurant we could easily find in our own town when there are usually awesome places to explore and local economies to support? We usually start by using Yelp to find places nearby that have good ratings, and this one came up first on the list.\n\nWe had some trouble finding the restaurant, which was really more down to Boyfriend's mistyping of the address into his GPS than the location of the building. It is in a bit of a strange place for a cafe, tucked in a fairly industrial neighborhood with very little other commercial property around, but I'm sure they make good money from the officefolk coming in for lunch breaks. Not a bad strategy, really.\n\nAll the non-vegetarians (meaning the three people there who weren't me) ordered Monte Cristos. If a restaurant serves one of those, you can pretty much bank on Boyfriend trying it at least once. I ordered an egg sandwich, myself, and when the owner heard I was a vegetarian he offered to add some extra vegetables to the sandwich so it wouldn't be boring.\n\nThe Montes were a big hit with everyone else, and based on the other reviews here, I'd say ordering one is a pretty safe bet. My egg sandwich was also delicious, and more than filling enough for breakfast. We liked the place so much that we came back two days later.\n\nTwo more Monte Cristos made their way into the bellies of my cohorts, including Boyfriend again. My sister's husband got a breakfast burrito, and I opted for a plate of French toast. When they say the French toast is big, they MEAN it. Three huge slices of Texas toast, dipped in batter and fried to golden perfection. It makes my mouth water just thinking about it. Again, everyone was pleased with their meals.\n\nI was the only person who had coffee while we were there, and while I don't necessarily agree with the people who rave about it being the best in town, it was definitely not bad. I ordered it both days, which I wouldn't have done if I'd hated it.\n\nAs for the atmosphere, it's definitely a little more Team Jesus than I'd like. I'm not a huge fan of people using their businesses to promote their spiritual beliefs, no matter what religious text they choose to read, so being surrounded by Bible verses and crosses was a little bit uncomfortable for me. However, the good food balanced that out, and the owners were both super friendly and talkative, engaging us in conversation the first day and welcoming us warmly the second day.

My husband's MBA program had an event that they catered, and the food was not up to normal par.  They did a BBQ and the meat was dried out, buns seemed stale, the sides did not have much flavor.  If I did not have my previous experience with them in Utah, I would have written them off.  \n\nSo as a place for lunch- I think they are GREAT.  As a catering company I am not so sure yet.

On top of that, a menu circulated the week prior and you were able to personally select your lunch of choice. Right on. \n\nI chose the Club Sandwich. Yep, that's right. Turkey, ham, bacon, cheese AND cranberry sauce on the side (to happily smear on my bread later for a festive treat). For my side, frog eye salad. Having no idea what this was when I saw it on the menu, I immediately went to Google to find out. Sounded good to me, so I opted to try it. Turns out it's a sweet concoction with tapioca, mandarin oranges and marshmallows (usually). \n\nMy lunch arrived in a little box with a clearly marked label on the top. Inside I found my sandwich neatly wrapped, the salad side sealed in a little container, standard plastic-ware with a single napkin, a pickle and tomato on the side, one cookie and a chocolate mint. (Not to mention packaged condiments like mayo and mustard.)\n\nThis is one of the best free sandwiched I've ever had, esp. with the cranberry sauce adding a great sweet balance to the meats and cheeses. Strangely enough, the size of this sandwich was reasonable, although it wasn't a standard sandwich size - not like the other sandwiches people ordered that were sliced in half. The Club is like a 3/4 of a sandwich, although the stuffings between the bread make it more than able to satiate a big appetite. Every bite of The Club was better than the last. The frog eye salad was tasty, too. The cookie was okay. At least it was soft and chewy. And chocolate (yes!). \n\nI really, really liked my lunch. I can tell that my work mates likes theirs, too, for everyone happily gobbled up their lunches super fast. I think I was the last to finish - if that tells ya anything.

The problem started when I ordered my BLT deluxe and the bacon is floppy or not fully cooked.  This happened consistently and so I finally asked what is the deal with the bacon... they said they order it they do not make it on site.  So then I felt as though I could not order this anymore because the bacon is never fully cooked.  So I still get lunches from them when my company orders lunch but I always get the veggie sandwich which is good and I am happy with that.  \nThe things I really like about apple spice is that they do not put condiments on their sandwiches... they have everything in packets and let you put it on yourself.

Whenever asked about my favourite sandwich I would always refer to the variety of toppings that I could select from at this place. \n\nI was first introduced to artichoke caponata at Vincenzo's as a sandwich topping, and very quickly the artichoke caponata spread that they make so well has become a favourite spread not only for sandwiches but also for crackers or on top of slices of baguette. There is no other art-cap, as many refer to it, like Vincenzo's. For me, they also made pesto-mayo a sandwich \"must-have\". What a simple topping, but also what a flavourful combination. I've tried to replicate at home, but I just haven't gotten the proper consistency. To add a kick of spice to their sandwiches they also offer the Bomb. The bomb is a nice and spicy taponade that they serve as a sandwich spread. While I am not also up for the spice, when I am, this sure does the trick. Be careful though, its really spicy! \n\nWhen it comes to actual toppings, they have your typical sandwich toppings like lettuce, tomato, cucumber, green pepper, black olives, onions, pickles, hot peppers, and bruschetta, but to set themselves apart from many other sandwich places around town they offer fancier toppings (at an additional cost of 25 cents) which include but are not limited to, artichokes, sundried tomatoes, and roasted eggplant. When it comes to meats and cheeses, if you want it, they've got it. They provide a list of meats and cheeses to choose from, but they also have an expansive selections of meats and cheeses not on their board, that if you see at the deli counter you can request on your sandwich. While their sandwiches have gone up in price, they still sit around the $5 mark and are well worth the money!\n\nThis place does not only offer sandwiches though. They have a hot food counter, a salad bar, a desserts and pastries counter, as well as a sushi bar. The sushi is made in house and is not bad. \n\nThis place is also a grocery store, which offers a wide variety of products that you will not find at your local supermarket. While the prices on some of grocery items are more than a local supermarket would offer, the quality you are receiving is reflected in the price. They have some fantastic fresh pasta which comes frozen and you order by the gram. They also have some fantastic breads to choose from in their bakery section. On your way out, if you are leaving through the back (where there is seating to eat your food) they also have a gelato counter and little cafe. They make great coffee here. \n\nThere is nothing bad I can say about this place. Whenever I am in Waterloo I make it a must to stop here and either grab a quick sandwich or some other food selection. Beware, I am not the only one who likes this place, and it has become quite the hot spot in Waterloo, so make sure you give yourself some time when you go!", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 5}}, {"text": "Excellent selection of European and local products.

It's a good mix and performs well all around. I'm simply going to review a few of the services since there are many. I've had plenty of sandwiches and have had coffee there  about twice. If you're into coffee, they made a solid cappuccino but I would have a few more to really give a fair impression.\n\nGrocery store/bakery:\n\nNow when I say grocery store, this is not your typical supermarket. It's got tons of options, many fresh and many imported from Europe. If you're looking for a specific cheese, they'll probably have it. They even have Queso Fresco, which is a rarity (try it on Pizza). You need olives, there's an abundance of selection including fresh olives (low sodium), which is also rare. Same goes for bread, meat, fish, clams, shrimp (keeping in mind, we are inland),  spices, bottled/canned goods from Europe, and plenty of other things that I've omitted. The only section that doesn't have a ton of options is the fruits and vegetables but if you're really picky about this kind of thing best to go to a market. Also, before I forget, the fresh pasta and raviolis are excellent. Well worth getting fresh the stuff over the dry options IMO.\n\nThe store is incredibly well staffed. It's actually impressive how much staff works there. Also, the staff is quite knowledgeable and most seem to be foodies. If you have any questions, they can usually answer them with specific recommendations.  Unless you're waiting for a sandwich or pasta at a peak time (lunch), the service is very quick.\n\nNow the only negative I have of Vincenzo's grocery shopping is because it's got such an awesome selection of delicious food, you might overspend a bit but at least you know you're getting quality and service. \n\nSandwich counter: \n\nthis is almost  a separate business from the grocery store since many people do come in just for lunch. It is very good. There is a great selection (just like the store) for everything you'd like to put in the sandwich starting with the bread and ending with toppings (Artichoke Caponata, Sun Dried Tomato Caponata, Bruschetta among others) . I find that you end up making your sandwich differently because of the choices, which makes it much less repetitive than going to subway. Also, the sandwiches are very well priced. I would highly recommend going here instead of Subway or other chains.\n\nPasta Counter (Thursdays only):\n\nI haven't personally experienced the pasta but my friend really enjoyed the dish that was made for him. There is a selection of meat, shrimp or chicken, then sauces and vegetables, with some delicious sauces (pesto, tomato, cream-based, etc). This is cooked on a stove in front of you. Like the sandwiches, the pasta dishes are well priced. The only negative is that the line can be long for this counter, which will take a while so try to go with a friend to keep you company.\n\nHot counter:\n\nThere is also a hot counter, which I have yet to sample but it also looks quite good.

Its a little confusing at first, because in front you are tall shelves full of bread dips and more soy sauces then I cared to count.  Behind is a rack of biscottis and wafers.

It has a deli, butcher, cheesemonger (is that even a word? if so, what a great word), savoury and sweet sauces and condiments, seafood, hot plate area, cafe, gelato (!!), groceries, and baked goods. I've been here for lunch a few times and I will say that their foods is not as good as the actual store area but it's still a delightful place for Waterloo.\n\nI first came here for lunch and didn't expect a great little retail store as well.  I ordered a sandwich at first and to be fair, the menu sounded a lot better than the execution.  I had the smoked chicken sandwich on a calabrese bun with their 'famous' artichoke caponata and various veggies.  I think for the price, it is fair but it just wasn't as flavourful as it was described to me by the person behind the counter.  I was salivating at the idea of the artichoke caponata as she explained it to me as a beautiful savoury creamy blend of roasted nutty vegetable flavour.  To me, the spread was just a lightly flavoured mayo.\n\nI also headed to baked good areas and grabbed my favourite baked treat... MACARONS!  These were very reasonably priced for minis.  It was less than $1 a piece.  I was thrilled... until I ate it.  The texture of these were far from meringue like and they were heavy like a brick butter cookie.  Upon discovering this, I asked if they were baked recently and found these were frozen in Europe and imported over and defrosted months later here... ugh. Save yourself the trouble and do not buy these!  I also got a tiramisu here and for $5 it was a bit pricey.  I would hope an Italian place would do tiramisu well but this was a disappoint as well.  It tasted only of sugary whip cream and not even marscapone cheese and espresso.  \n\nThe cheese area brought back me to delighted stage.  I found so many great cheeses including real imported GOP buffalo mozzarella.  With the price at $6, I found it very reasonable for authentic GOP.  I also bought some GOP aged balsamic vinegar and it was phenomenal.  For $10, I got a lovely syrupy sweet and acidic black liquid gold that is perfect for grilled chicken.\n\nService is personable, quick, and friendly!

The food is AMAZING not to mention visually appealing with short wait times for food. After a meal at Thai Sun I find myself craving the flavours their meals leave in my mouth for days. Although your typical menu item might cost $1-$2 more than it would at a competing Thai restaurant in Waterloo the quality makes up for it. The restaurant itself has a great aesthetic, although it can be alittle dim inside for me at times, and also features a very large patio for outdoor dining which is fantastic in the summer.\n\nAs a local to the area who frequents the various restaurants in Waterloo I highly recommend Thai Sun to anyone who loves good food.

This place is crazy busy during the holidays- the line loops inside and is out the door! But if you've had the ham and the turkey, you understand why. It's one of  those great holiday traditions- to have a Honeybaked Ham. It's not cheap, but it's worth every penny. There is a full ham, a mini-ham, or a miscut (I think that this one tends to be a little cheaper, out of the three). If you want leftovers, buy a big one. So, if you are planning to come here, and it's around the holidays, better get here early or you will be waiting a while. Then again, it's worth the wait.\n\nThe sandwiches are really good too. Sometimes there are coupons in the weekly circulars (Red Plum) with specials for the sandwich combos @ $5.99. If you get a stamp card, you will get a free sandwich after 6 sandwiches are purchased. We went once over the weekend and we were the only ones here. \n\nIf you want really good ham, come here. This is a well-known brand that people have come to love, year after year.

As was the case a few years ago, when I went with my mom. For years, many families here have enjoyed the delicious ham and turkey during Easter, Thanksgiving, & Christmas. Save the bone for Ham Bone Soup- it's so yummy. You can also buy the bone, but there is a limit of one to a customer. Many years ago, there was a location on Maryland Parkway, across from the Boulevard Mall, but that's showing how long I've called Las Vegas home.\n\nNot only does this company have excellent ham, the turkey is excellent too (roasted, smoked). There are free samples of the turkey (both kinds) and other products. Sometimes the turkey is on special for $19.99 during the holidays. There are several other excellent products like the ham bone soup mix, mustard, pineapple chutney, and side dishes too. \n\nThis company also makes yummy sandwiches. I got the Classic-  roasted turkey, lettuce, tomato, savory sauce, mustard, on a soft sweet kaiser looking roll that smashes down as you eat it.  My husband likes the Smoke Stacker- ham, lettuce, minus the tomatoes which I end up getting, barbeque sauce, on a ciabatta roll (not overly big, which I hate getting). If you get the stamp card, you will get a free sandwich after purchasing 5 sandwiches. We got the combos (lots of choices- salads, chips, etc., and both cost a little over $16.00. FYI, if you have a gift card, don't separate the card from the card that it is attached to, or else, the gift card is no good- it states so on the card. \n\nLocated in a strip mall on Rainbow, not far from Charleston.

They were actual, freshly made meals that tasted great! I signed up for the select diet, 3 meals and 2 snacks were delivered to my front door every night for the following day. I loved the fact that you could log into the website and choose your menu, they had so many different options.\n         In the past two weeks I have tried quite a few meals and snacks. My favorite for breakfast was the whole wheat blueberry pancakes, they were nice and fluffy and the blueberries added just enough sweetness. For lunch I would have to go with the open faced french dip sandwich, the roast beef was super moist and it had just enough cheese and bread. The grilled tri-tip served with a side salad was my favorite dinner, the tri-tip was cooked perfectly and had a really mild horse radish sauce that went with it great. As for the snacks my favorite mid day snack was the sliced honey turkey with fresh fruit and the fudge brownie was amazing for dessert.   \n         Overall I would have to say that I was very impressed with the not only the quality and freshness of the meals but also the great organization the company had, they made it very easy to choose my meals and I never heard the delivery man at night which was nice especially since we have a dog. I would definitely recommend Sunfare to anyone who wants to have good quality meals delivered to them without having to put much effort into it.

Before Sunfare I ate out a lot and ordered a lot of fast food.  I did it out of convenience so I thought Sunfare would be a good idea because it was even more convenient.  I soon realize that Sunfare was more than just convenient.  It was also healthy and delicious.  More so than most places I've eaten before.  My wife and I don't cook and when we went grocery shopping we'd end up wasting most of the grocery items because we never got around to cooking it and end up wasting a ton of money by throwing food in the garbage.  With Sunfare we never have to worry about throwing away wasted food.  So is Sunfare a good value?  Yes, it is!  No more wasted food and no more going shopping for food and no more spending time in the kitchen making inedible meals.

We did not receive one compliment, and the food on most of our guests' plates was barely eaten.  A total waste of our money and food.  Plus, the appetizers included antipasto and  vegetables, served no less with absolutely no ranch dressing ... people were looking around for some sort of dipping sauce.  And, then I had to go back into the kitchen area and request more cheese and salami be put out on the table.  There stood 3 young people just hanging out doing absolutely nothing as I asked them to not let the appetizers run out.  They did not even have another platter prepared!  I watched one of the girls slowly put one piece of cheese at a time on a plate. They just took their good old time.  I had to go around and tell our guests that more cheese and salami plates were being made.  By the time a platter was prepared and ready to eat, shortly thereafter, another person came out from the kitchen and took it away!!  Again, another huge embarrassment and waste of money and food.  On top of it, I could go on and on about the stressful and rude interaction with Chef Timothy.
