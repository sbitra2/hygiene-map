Of course it wasn't very impressive while it was still Hamburger Mary's. \n\nThe service is hit and miss and the food is sub-par. Every time I've been here and ordered a burger, the bun has been stale and crumbly. Every. Time. The salads consisted mostly of the delectable white core of the iceberg lettuce that has no flavor.\n\nThe Sunday breakfast buffet is fairly expensive, around $15 per person. The only redeeming feature of the buffet is the 1 cent mimosas. Smoking is still allowed inside the restaurant (until May at least).\n\nIf you're going to a place to hang out with a large group of friends who drink and smoke and food isn't a pressing issue, then this may be the place for you. \n\nI'm sorry, Burger Betty's. I've tried to like you from way back when, but it's time for me to move on. I have to see other restaurants. I hope you understand.

Either drop your prices to make it just a large bar food type menu - or dramatically increase the quality. Notice I didn't say quantity.  The burgers are big.  And a hungry person might not finish them.  But they wouldn't particularly like it.  And if you want them to order one again, they need to like it.  \n\nSure, you've got a bit of a corner on the whole gay restaurant thing.  (Not a total corner on it though - but I'll give that there isn't that much competition.)  But do you really want to ride on those laurels?  I think you can do better.  I hope you do better soon.  How about a 1/2 size burger for 1/2 the price?  Same thing w/ the salads as right now they could feed a table of 4.  But how many tables of 4 want to split the same salad?  Exactly.  \n\nAnd while I can accept the weird atmosphere changes as you try to find a \"theme\" to carry you to your next success.  How about stopping all of your investment and hard work on the Australian theme and going with a \"good food and comfortable atmosphere theme\".  I'm telling you - it could be a hit.  \n\nI'll try to check back twice a year or so to see how you're doing.  I believe in you Betty.

A burger sounded fine and we had driven past this place a few times so we thought we'd drop in. \n\nWe knew that quite a few places on this stretch were of the gay persuasion, but it didn't occur to us that Burger Betty's would be one. \n\nWalk inside and you'll quickly realize that this is not intended for a father-son lunch spot.
