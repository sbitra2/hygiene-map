Gee - I'm sorry....shall we go stand out in the rain for 15 min while you finish your conversation? Not a good start to our evening... \n\nI likened their dark beer (Caledonian Ale) to more of an amber ale & tried 2 different varieties but thought they were both lacking a certain something \n\nStarted out w/ a Poached Pear w/ Cheese - it was okay but cold.  Guess this is what we get for being the 1st to dine - things right out of the fridge\n\nBoth Mom & Dad had the Salmon which they enjoyed  \n\nMy Veggie Risotto was crunchy - nuff said \n\nOnly Dad ordered dessert - the Strawberries & Cream & the verdict was delish.

In fact, its better if you don't tell anyone else about this place or it could get as difficult to get into as the Wedgwood. The food was certainly as good.  \n\nFirst the atmosphere was well done, stone with tasteful tartan accents. Impeccably Scotttish as was the food. With the layout and the lighting it was romantic, this is not a kid-friendly restaurant. \n\nThe service was amiable and attentive, if a bit difficult to understand at times. As I've noticed at most of the UK restaurants I visited this summer; the staff are from the EU countries in deepest economic crisis (Spain, Greece and Italy were all well represented). But this was a relatively minor hassle. And the food was worth it.\n\nThe beer was excellent and local, you can't ask for more than that.\n\nI started with the haggis wontons in a wine reduction. They were an unusual combination of sweet, umami and spicy that was enjoyable. I followed with the salmon. You really can't go wrong with scottish salmon, it was tender and flavorful. My father had the venison dish, and I tried some. Dear god, I almost regretted my order. It was unlike any American venison I had ever had. It was sweet, tender and completely lacking any gaminess. It tasted like a combination of buffalo sweetness and kobe juiciness. \n\nAnyway, go there. Its a bit off the beaten path of the Royal Mile, but go there anyway.

Our good friends went with us on a Saturday night.  This place was great.  I'd describe it like others: part bistro, part cafe, part casual restaurant.  It also has take-out and a market if you are longing for your European favorite chocolates, sauces, canned meats :-).\n\nWe sat in the restaurant area.  VERY casual and I loved that.  We were greeted very kindly by one of the owners' wife.  The menu has plenty of options.  Our server (who actually was one of the owners as well) told us about the special (Chicken Cordon Bleu) and spoke with such perfection in his accents on Spanish and French words that we had to ask where he was from.  \n\nOne of the owners, Luka (sorry if I misspelled it), was born in Serbia, but grew up in the French Riviera.  His father was a professional soccer player so they traveled a lot.  Luka himself was also a professional soccer player and that is what brought him to Arizona (on a scholarship).  He loved it so much and decided to stay.  VERY humble and nice guy and it is great that the owners have such a stake in the business at these early stages.\n\nTwo in our party opted for the Cordon Bleu special, which was fantastic!  I ordered the Athena sandwich (pastrami) and my friend ordered the Madrid sandwich (prosciutto and turkey and brie).  All of these were the first recommendations from Luka, whithout hesitation.  THEY WERE GREAT!  There were so many things on the menu and I wanted to try them all...so I'll definitely be back.\n\nThe portions were perfect, and the sandwich portion was generous.  We heard about the crepes as well and opted to order (2 per order, yum!).  We got Nutella/Banana and Nutella/Toasted Coconut/Crushed biscuit.  Holy crap they were good -- do the crushed biscuit...it really adds something great!\n\nOverall, this place was fantastic!  If there was a 4.5 star rating I'd have to give it that.  Luka was very kind, explained everything and shared some personal history of his journey to this point.  Great atmosphere.  He also explained the name of the restaurant to us, so you'll have to ask *when* you go (not if, but when).\n\nThis is a great place and we WILL be back!  We saw they have a \"breakfast in Paris\" menu on Sat/Sunday morning so we'll have to try that some time.\n\nIt is places like Pastis that I hope truly survive more than the conglomorates.

It's about the Food!\n\nI guess my lunch was pretty straightforward. I had a Palermo, which is genoa salami, cold smoked pepperoni, ham, provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato & \"special sauce\" (tasted like a savory vinagrette). It came with a fruit cup. The sandwich was very hearty, the bread rustic, and a simple but satisfying lunch. Part of me was proud of going for healthy in eating the fruit cup, but then the cynical part of me reminded myself I had drank about a gallon of Sprite, which I can only assume is not that healthy. Definitely one of the better sandwiches I've had in the Valley.\n\nToni's lunch on the other hand was spectacular. She had pasta di diavolo, bowtie pasta with spicy italian sausage, fresh basil, crushed hot red peppers and creamy marinara sauce, sprinkled with fresh parmesan reggiano cheese. Wow. That sauce was what made this dish so heavenly. Toni let me finish hers off, but she is pretty light on consuming sauce so when it came to my time to step up to the plate (call my agent but let me assure you I consider my comedy routine an art form and not mere entertainment) I noticed there was a good portion of pure, unadulterated, heavenly sauce. With a frenzied look in my eyes, I spoon up the marinara , consume it feverishly, and eye with resentment the glistening remains of marinara on Toni's fork.\n\nPasti's Eurogrille and Delicatessen really elevates my mood whenever I go.

Go figure, right?\n\nTo top it all off, we had the marscapone cheesecake that didn't stand a chance against us even though we said we were \"full.\" It was too irresistable. Not as rich and dense as traditional cheesecake but that's what I loved about.\n\nService was awesome, shout out to Skyler! Manager and Chef came by to check on us.

I've had to rack my brains to see if my recollection of it was as poor as the current reality but upon reading the other 5 reviews here it seems things have always been ropey. Dealing with the positives first my French Toast with Bacon & Maple Syrup along with my friend's order turned up in good time after the order was placed, as did our paninis on the first of our 1am visits. Drinks were also not delayed. On the down side, however, our second late night visit saw us having to amend our drinks order twice (first due to there being no St. Helier cider & secondly due to there being no Rose) and the requested Nachos with no Guacamole but extra Sour Cream arrived with the green stuff & not the white as Sour Cream had also run out. They were therefore left untouched (they looked rather unappetising anyway due to the uber-orange cheese used in their preparation). Invisibility at time of the bill being required was also an issue. As an earlier reviewer points out they have a captive audience but this should really spur them to do the niche they occupy justice. 2-and-a-half years after my last visit here I took the decision to pop in last Friday around Midnight for want of anywhere decent that wasn't soon going to be kicking out. Nothing's really changed since 2008. Both my companion and I ordered Caesar salads and I also had a burger, having wrongly assumed my salad would be starter sized. The salads were of decent proportion but the chicken noticeably dry whilst the burger was no different from what I could manage to remove from a packet and grill myself at home. For some reason too my supposed mango shake tasted mostly of banana. Leaving the rating at 2 because you could probably still manage to sit here for hours and not eat without getting hustled out by the staff but I really must remember not to go here when food's required. Ended up here for food yesterday teatime (not my choice) and got the impression the place had changed hands. Service was good (we were the only customers for the hour we were there so they'd have been hard pressed to mess that up) but the Arabic wrap wasn't as good as some I've had from other places in town of late. \nChange of ownership thoughts were occasioned by what looks to be refurbished seating and the redesigned menu (see photo) which whomever quality controlled it before printing deserves the sack for  as well as the highlighted error it is riddled with 'serve' instead of served and offers 'Quacamole' as well as the commoner, non-duck Guacamole.

The menu is quite extensive, granted you can get all day breakfast as well as typical nosh, and for some items you can make combos up as the menu states. We chose omelettes one with smoked salmon and cream cheese, the other with chicken. \n\nFood comes with fries and salad - though I wasn't impressed with either. The fries on a cold plate are not too pleasant to eat! Would it not be more beneficial to keep the plate heated right up until serving and include any green leaves as a separate side dish? That said the plate sizes were huge, I mean larger than conventional sized dinner plates(8-12\").\n\nI might go back again to try some other dishes to see if this was just a one off but will ask for fries and salad served separately or dropped. The friendliness of staff is ok,  and it's not too busy even around 8-9pm, means you can get a seat, also the omelettes were very tasty.\n\nFavorit is also not very far away from the centre of town to walk to and competitive prices. \u00a320-ish for two mains, one Belgian waffle dessert, two coffees, and soft drinks. I would recommend for people on a budget especially during high season or festival times.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}], "state": "EDH", "stars": 3.0, "latitude": 55.9454326}], "2 2PR": [{"full_address": "3-5 Rose Street\nNew Town\nEdinburgh EH2 2PR", "rest_id": "SczkajqoJLycUK_yedMzGw", "categories": ["Pubs", "Bars", "Modern European", "Nightlife"], "city": "Edinburgh", "review_count": 0, "name": "The Abbotsford", "longitude": -3.1945389, "reviews": [], "state": "EDH", "stars": 4.0, "latitude": 55.9532862}], "85251": [{"full_address": "7167 E Rancho Vista Dr\nSte 111\nScottsdale, AZ 85251", "rest_id": "_AvHni-xdRHmZ3XfYHwGkg", "categories": ["Modern European", "American (New)"], "city": "Scottsdale", "review_count": 0, "name": "Posh Improvisational Cuisine", "longitude": -111.9280645, "reviews": [], "state": "AZ", "stars": 4.0, "latitude": 33.5068492}], "2 3JD": [{"full_address": "158-162 Rose Street\nNew Town\nEdinburgh EH2 3JD", "rest_id": "B430si3BBCcULnKBS6Bh8Q", "categories": ["Modern European", "British"], "city": "Edinburgh", "review_count": 0, "name": "Pickled Green", "longitude": -3.2017123, "reviews": [], "state": "EDH", "stars": 4.5, "latitude": 55.9518742}]}}
