I discovered wild pigeon, venison and cranachan there (fortunately not on the same plate). It was always the place I recommended to friends looking for good Scottish cuisine and I've got nothing but fond memories. \n\nI've now recently visited both Dublin Street and St Mary's St locations and I have to say, I'm left wanting more. I had a thoroughly pleasant evening last night, the restaurant is very pretty in a Georgian manner, I think the prices are reasonable and the meal is fine, but distinctly unmemorable. I found the menu repetitive - vegetarian options all featured brocolli (which I am allergic to) and the dish I chose also arrived with a slightly yellowed sprig to garnish my dish. Beetroot was also quite a feature (I like beetroot, we are all good on that front). \n\nFor starters, I had the sea trout cured in vodka and beetroot, served with beetroot and red amaranth. The  sea trout carried barely any flavour but was a stunning deep red colour and overall the plate looked impressive, but the beetroot itself was the over riding flavour, drowning out the cured trout and the lemon mustard dressing was entirely forgettable. My dad tucked into some moist looking duck and was most happy with it. \n\nFor the mains, I had 10 (or 5?) spice salmon, with dill mash and beans (and a surprise guest - brocolli). Again, it looked pretty, and this time, although none of the flavours were particularly amazing on their own, combined with the citrus and chilli creme fraiche (not spicy), came together nicely. My mother enjoyed her lamb casserole and my dad was impressed with his pork dish. \n\nFinally, we finished off with the autumn brioche (dad loved it, I found it a bit too heavy on the spice for me, something didn't taste right) and marscapone panne cotta - the blackcurrant ice cream was delicious, the panne cotta bland and for me, there wasn't enough of contrast in flavours to enhance either. \n\nOverall, I think Stac Polly still does a lot right, but their menu doesn't excite me, or move me in particular. There are lots of small things which makes me think that it falls short of being impressive and simply remains at 'nice', where once I would demand Stac Polly for any monumental occasion, I think now, it sits nicely in there as a pleasant, middle of the road restaurant that hasn't reached the heights of fine dining, but is definitely of a better class than most, but it needs a bit of a push to make it a place I would aspire to go to.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "The service really let this place down, as my food was of very good quality.

I like a gooey French onion soup. For my main,I ordered the Frenchie burger because I heard DB is famous for his burgers. However, the burger that i got was more like a salt brick. The patty itself seemed that it was way over-salted. Plus they added the \"morbier cheese confit pork belly\" which sounds delicious on paper but just added to the saltiness. The burger was so salty, i finished 4 glasses of water and only finished half of the burger. In hindsight, I should have sent the burger back, especially paying $19 for a burger, it should be perfect. Also, I do understand the restaurant just opened, so it could be a learning lesson for the kitchen as well. My friend ordered the lingini and loved it. My other friend order the Yankee burger and loved it as well. So take my words with a grain of....salt. ha.\n\nService -\nWhen our party arrived we were seated immediately in a very nice booth. The restaurant does look like French bistro/brasserie, upscale yet casual. Upon being seated, we waited about 5+ minutes until we received our menus, which I thought was odd. Not sure why the hostess doesn't just hand out the menus (seems inefficient to me). The waitress was very nice and welcoming but seemed very busy. There were a lot of manager looking people standing around. Not sure what they were doing but felt the service could have been more efficient. But again, having recently opened, I'm sure this will be worked out.\n\nOverall, I'm not sure I would recommend this restaurant, especially with all the awesome dining choices you have in Vegas. However, if the food was better (perhaps the kickhen wasn't tasting the food?) and the service kinks were worked out, I do think this could be a good restaurant, especially for the value.

The pat\u00e9 and foie gras were excellent with some fris\u00e9e served with them.  We each got two slices of bread on which to spread the pat\u00e9.  \n\nFollowing this, we were brought escargots sp\u00e4tzle with chicken oyster, garlic, parsley coulis, and hazelnut.  The sp\u00e4tzle was soft and very tasty and the nut pieces for texture were a perfect addition.\n\nNext came a course of sea scallops on a bed of corn.  The scallops were cooked on point and this, too, was a very tasty dish.\n\nThe the Tunisian lamb chop with some merguez sausage with cousocus, lemon braised spinach, red pepper tagine, and some chickpeas.  The chop was excellent, perfectly rare, and the spinach was very good.  The sausage had a small bit of spiciness to it.  Another winning dish.\n\nFor the last main, we got the crispy duck confit with a petite onion ring, trumpet royale mushroom, and some swiss chard and a small turnip.  Excellent duck.  \n\nWe then went to our dessert course.  We had ordered 6 items--a cheese plate with 5 selections, raspberry clafoutis, black and white fondant, Gateau Basque, \"Le Pr\u00e9sident\", and Madeleines.  The five cheeses were: Pierre Robert Triple cr\u00e8me, Humboldt Fog goat, Petit Basque sheep, Pennsylvania Noble cheddar, and Fourme d'Ambert bleu.  The cheese plate was served with cranberry bread, nuts, and quince preserves.  The cheese plate was outstanding!  My favorites were the triple cr\u00e8me and the bleu.  I often buy Petit Basque so that was nothing new for me.\n\nThe desserts were quite good.  Standouts here were the Gateau Basque, \"Le Pr\u00e9sident\" and the black and white fondant with verbena ice cream. \"Le Pr\u00e9sident\" was a chocolate-hazelnut mousse tort and coffee chantilly.  The gateau Basque was a custard cake, brandied cherries, and vanilla Anglaise.   The texture differences of \"Le Pr\u00e9sident\"--the mousse tort with the bitter chocolate rings hiding the interior were wonderful together.  The gateau Basque was very smooth and quite a different cake than generally served.  With dessert, two of us had coffee and one had a single espresso.  \n\nThroughout the meal, the waitstaff was excellent.  There was a little hesitancy with one server as the restaurant has only been open for about three weeks.  I was brought a fresh glass of iced tea before finishing the one I had.  Water was refilled during the meal.\n\nThe only reason I didn't give the fifth star was the mixup in the tasting menu.  The runner had taken the lead in contacting the restaurant about a tasting menu.  After some conversation, a list was sent and approved for our group.  However, two of the things we had chosen were not served and one of the appetizers we got, the scallops, was not ordered.

Quiet, yet boisterous. Elegant, but subdued. I've wanted to try Chef Boulud's food for a long time. It exceeded all of my expectations...which were very high.\n\nThe service was good. We had an attentive waiter, everything came out in a timely manner and every need was met. Nothing over the top and nothing that set DB apart from the norm, but good. The only gripe I have is that it would've been nice to have some more description of the courses as they came out. These aren't your typical \"steak frites\" or \"onion soup\" dishes. Some involved some serious thought and expertise and deserved more than just, \"here's your calamari.\"\n\nI loved the atmosphere. A fine mix of classic French decor, (tile floors and leather banquettes) and a contemporary, inviting ambience. It was luxurious, yet comfortable.\n\nBut what brings this restaurant to five stars is the food. We didn't get an entree; just a plethora of small plates and appetizers.\n\nLamb flatbread: perfectly crispy and rich. The buttery lamb was braised down with eggplant and Mediterranean spices until it was smooth and silky. The yogurt based sauce on top added just the right amount of tang to balance out the rich flavor of the lamb. It was garnished with micro cilantro that still had seedlings of coriander attached and diced apricots. Really added nice fresh and sweet notes so that everything was in perfect harmony.\n\nShellfish plateau: this is a guilty pleasure of ours. Nothing different from the norm aside from the ridiculous freshness of everything. We had oysters from both the east and west coasts (I can't tell you what kind they were because we weren't informed). They were plump, juicy and sweet. There was also king crab, lobster tail and shrimp. The mignonette was tart and peppery and was perfect with the oysters. They also served a beautiful \"French\" cocktail sauce which had the addition of mayonnaise and brandy. A nice touch that gave a lobster bisque-ish flavor to the perfectly poached shellfish.\n\nBalik smoked salmon: my favorite dish of the evening. The house cured and smoked salmon was garnished simply with toasted caraway seed and sliced. It was so unctuous and creamy. Easily the best smoked salmon I've ever tried. There were little potato dauphinois puffs with the roe and a touch of creme fraiche in the middle. Light, but rich and unbelievably delicious. I wonder if they sell those instead of popcorn at movie theaters in France. The trio of salmon was finished with a decadent salmon rillette with a tiny toasted pumpernickel cracker on the bottom. So much technique was put into this dish. It was perfect.\n\nBurratta salad: a simple and unique take on a tomato-mozzarella salad. The burratta sat atop a braised artichoke heart, which, in turn, sat atop diced tomatoes. It was surrounded by a salad of arugula with a sharp balsamic vinaigrette. Under normal circumstances, the acidity of the dressing would've been overwhelming. But this is why I was so impressed with this place. The chefs know how rich the burratta is and how much it craves to be cut by a little acid. Balance. It's all about balance.\n\nThai calamari: perfectly cooked. I know it's cliche to say something like that in a review, but more often than not, calamari is over cooked in many restaurants. The beer batter was so incredibly crispy and worked so well with the chewy texture of the beloved mollusk. The sauce was a play on thai red curry and had some good spice to it. It was all finished with pickled, bright red Fresno chiles and cilantro. A beautiful dish in sight and in taste.\n\nPommes frites: I had to get em. Nothing special here, but they were, of course, perfect. Served with ketchup, to my surprise. I asked for a side of aioli and was obliged. When in Rome!\n\nBalance. Years of training and obsession with perfection. Countering textures and flavors. Sweet, spicy, bitter, sour, savory...they were all there. My hat is off to you, Chef Boulud.

That DB Burger was simply too amazing and when I found out that DB Brasserie was returning, I had high hopes in being able to have the DB Burger once again.  However, a few weeks before my trip, I saw their grand opening menu and noticed that it was missing, which almost made me not want to go.\n\nWhen I arrived in Vegas, at first I wasn't too sure about going there since it was so close to their grand opening and I assumed they were still working out the kinks.  So it pretty much became a game-time decision on my last day there when I made a reservation for dinner.  And I don't regret that decision one bit!\n\nI love the fresh new look of the place.  It's definitely brighter and more inviting than the old location which was dark and almost cave-like.  The decor is quite similar to Bouchon which is a hybrid of classic bistro look with a modern touches.\n\nMenu -- http://bit.ly/1mmt90m\nI'm not sure what exactly carried over from the old Wynn location, but this current menu is a like a 'greatest hits' mashup of all his restaurants in NYC from Bar Boulud, DBGB, and Daniel.  Unfortunately for me, the DB Burger that I enjoyed back at the old location wasn't on the menu here.  Which was fine because I was willing to try something new with this visit.\n\nHere's what I had for dinner:\n\nFresh baked baguette and foccacia. -- http://bit.ly/1omQGCE\nThey give you a small portion to start with, but you can always ask for more bread.  The baguette was nice, hot, and chewy.\n\nEscargot Spatzle -- http://bit.ly/1omQMKA\nburgundy snail fricass\u00e9e, chicken \"oysters\", mushrooms, garlic, parsley coulis, hazelnut\nI've never had Escargot of any kind before so I decided to man-up and try this.  It was delicious!  I actually couldn't distinguish the Escargot from the sauteed mushrooms, but everything on the plate tasted good with the spatzle giving it some substance.\n\nBeef Duo  -- http://bit.ly/1noUxOz\nred wine braised short ribs & roasted tournedos, Supergreen spinach, pommes pur\u00e9e, carrots 'ni\u00e7oise'\nI basically decided to order this beforehand when I saw them post a pic of this on their Facebook page.  Can you say....OMFGYUM!!!  The short ribs were braised perfectly that it broke down so easily with my fork.  No knife needed!!  And the tournedo was like butter!!  So tender and juicy and just melted in my mouth!  This was probably one of the best beef entrees I've ever had.\n\n\"le president\" - chocolate and hazelnut mousse tart --  http://bit.ly/1p5pp9Q\nChocolate-Hazelnut Mousse Tart, Coffee Chantilly\nBest way to finish the night.  I ordered this with zero expectations and it was rich decadent.  Very nice presentation!  The mousse was nice and cool too.\n\nI'm definitely coming back to DB Brasserie.  I would love to try everything else on the menu and hopefully next time I go there, maybe the DB Burger will return.   I actually wouldn't mind coming back for lunch as well, now that they have a 3-course prix-fixe menu for under $30.  It doesn't get any better than that, especially on The Strip.

Decided it would be nice to take advantage of the better dining options at the Venetian since the Rio is sorely lacking in that area.\n\nOur hostess was very courteous when we asked if they had a table for two available although were a walk in (although I didn't show up with a huffy and entitled shitty attitude, so that probably helped too, take note Yelpers...) and we were offered a vacant table right away.\n\nWe were waited on promptly and told our waitress we had a time constraint. That mostly worked well although we had to wave her down when it was time to head out, but at that point quite a few more diners had arrived and the bill was still settled in time. \n\nI chose a glass of wine from a list that looked thoughtful and well-curated. It was an exceedingly rare occasion to have an available selection of quality wines offered by the glass. \n\nOur starters were the burrata and the escargots spaetzle. The latter was an exceptional combination of flavors and textures. Mains were the halibut and Tunisian lamb. Perfectly seasoned and cooked with an elegant but simple presentation. \n\nI would go so far as to say this definitely exceeds Bouchon for a few reasons: service is better overall, ambiance more intimate (Bouchon can get deafeningly loud with a crowd in there), cocktails and wine list appear better and the food is much better overall. Not much \"simple\" French bistro fare at DB but most dishes feature Boloud's signature Med touches yet remain unfussy, despite the lengthy menu descriptions for some.\n\nI would compare our dinner to courses I've had at a few one-star Michelin restaurants even. I highly recommend a visit here if you're staying at the Venetian, and even if you're not it's worth coming from another hotel to dine here. \n\nWe didn't have time to try dessert or an opportunity to return, but I'd love to return next time I'm in Vegas.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Went here based on the reviews.

I tried my friend's Manhattan, and it had nicely layered flavor.\n\nFood:\nI started with Escargot that were fried to a delicious, almost crispy chicken skin consistency.  There was also a mixture of shaved and fried garlic with normally cooked escargot.  The Foie Gras with cashew bread and a sweet chutney leveled with the salt and fat present very well.

While in a cab to our hotel, I grabbed one of the free booklets in the cab and immediately saw Daniel Boulud's restaurant DB Brasserie.  I immediately went to OpenTable to book a reservation.  I recently finished reading \"Talking With My Mouth Full\" by Gail Simmons where she talks quite a bit about Daniel Boulud so I knew I had to try his food.  When we arrived, I don't think the restaurant was half full.  We were seated at a two person top.  I quickly found that my back was to the restaurant which bummed me out.  I was facing a wall.  Before we were even served our dinner, another couple was seated right next to us.  Really?  The place is half empty and you have to seat another table right next to us?  I thought that was pretty lame.  But we started with bartender's choice mocktails of which mine was pineapple, orange, cranberry juices and my partner's was lavender soda.  They were both good but hers was a bit more unique.  We then tried the Thai style calamari.  It was excellent with a lime sauce and pickled, julienned vegetables.  There were also some fried onions which I didn't think were really needed.  I'd preferred just the calamari rather than what seemed to be a filler for the tender seafood.  My partner got the Duck Confit which was incredible.  It was tender, flavorful meat with a crispy skin on top of swiss chard with saut\u00e9ed onions, crispy onion rings, turnips and a thick, leathery mushroom that my partner didn't like so I ate them.  The dish was awesome.  She was in heaven.  It's not often that you find duck confit for dinner which was a nice treat.  Whenever we see it as an appetizer, we get it so it was such a treat to have it as an entree.\n\nWe'd been hiking all day so I was really interested in the pasta dish Linguine De Sud which was lemon linguine with assorted seafood.  When it was set down in front of me, it looked amazing.  It was a reasonable portion of pasta.  I hate when a trough of food is placed in front of me.  I'm more about quality than quantity.  Usually, when there's enough for six people in one dish, they're making up for something which means it's not going to be an incredible dish.  I took the first bite and just loved the feel of the homemade pasta, the smooth, richness of the delicate sauce.  I was in heaven.  Before I could take my next bite, I felt a bit of heat to the dish.  I actually coughed a few times as I wasn't expecting it to attack the back of my throat.  My partner asked if I was ok.  I told her of the heat.  We exchanged bites and I warned her about the heat.  I love spice but she does not.  It completely choked her.  She drank a glass of water and had to wait a bit before resuming eating her dinner.  I didn't mind the heat but did find it a bit overpowering for such a delicate dish.  I really felt that they accidentally dumped too much red pepper in the dish and just didn't feel like remaking it.  I thought about mentioning it to the server but didn't want her to think I was complaining.  I did finish the entire dish but had that pepper catch in my throat several times.  I was almost sweating by the time I finished.  I reread the menu and I wasn't sure it was the same dish.  I was happy none-the-less.  We decided to split a dessert - the Le President which was a chocolate-hazelnut mousse with coffee cream in a chocolate shell.

It is an inviting open restaurant with a large bar area and dark wood furnishings all around.  \n\nWe arrived before our other guests and sat down for a pre-dinner drink at the bar.  We had boulevardier ($17) and a maitresse ($13).  The brasserie's version of the boulevardier is a mixture of Bulleit rye whiskey instead of bourbon, Aperol instead of Campari and sweet vermouth with a slice of orange rind.  It was a really good pour with no ice to mask the taste and the heavy cut crystal glass it was served in was a nice touch.  The maitresse, served in a martini glass, was a sweet concoction of rum, lime and coconut liqueur that perhaps would make a good drink if you were sitting by the pool but it didn't work well before dinner.\n\nWhen the rest of the group arrived, we started with the Terrine of foie gras ($24), burrata ($14), and the crab timbale ($20).  All three tasted ok but the delicate crab flavor was overwhelmed by the taste of the overlying fruit and the foie gras terrine didn't have the punch or flavor of the seared version that you could get upstairs at Bouchon.\n\nFor dinner we has the Tunisian lamb with merguez sausage ($45), the sea scallops ($29), the oven roasted halibut ($40) and the swordfish ($42).  The scallops had a good sear on them and were served on a bed of sweet corn and shitake mushrooms.  They were delicious. The halibut was also cooked just right and was moist and flavorful. On the other hand, the swordfish was on the dry side and kind of bland.  Perhaps they had two different chefs cooking the fish that night?  The lamb and spicy sausage tasted fine on its own but seemed heavy in comparison to the first two seafood dishes.\n\nFor desert, the standout of the night was the grand marnier souffl\u00e9 with vanilla anglaise sauce ($15). I don't know how he got it to be so light and airy or how it came out so fast but it was one of the best I have ever had. Roy Yamaguchi could learn a thing or two about cooking souffl\u00e9's from this place. We also split the pistachio-cherry Sunday ($14). This tasted great while you were eating the overlying flavorful pistachio ice cream but it lost its charm when you got down to the sour cherry ice cream underneath.\n\nOverall, it was a good dining experience.

I mentioned in my review of George Hughes & Son Fish Emporium (note, not a fishmonger) how important I (and a lot of preachy TV chefs) feel using local, sustainable produce is so this is good to see.\n\nThe menu is fairly simple and I like this. Convoluted, overly long menus really put me off a place. Ranging from leek, red onion and blue cheese tartlet to beef rump with potatoes and pepper sauce Bia Bistrot has something to cater to everyone. Prices are fair. Not cheap, but fair. And the food is delicious. They also do a pre theatre menu for \u00a39 (2 courses) or \u00a310.50 (3 courses), which is pretty reasonable. \n\nIt's also very tastefully decorated which makes for a nice atmosphere.

What made it even better for us was how wonderfully baby friendly the place was, completed with delightfully friendly staff.\n\n We were in for Mother's day lunch and the menu they had on was a delightful selection of dishes. \n\nTheir starter of asparagus, poached egg and herb salad made my day as the asparagus was wonderfully sweet and the egg was poached to perfection. My husband's starter of mackerel (complete with perfectly crispy skin) and rhubarb was gone in a flash and our son was delighted with the piece he was given to nibble.\n\nMy main of free range chicken breast was cooked so well it was full of flavor and the meat was still tender and moist and was accompanied by a lovely little smoked chicken pasty and some very tasty braised leeks. My husband's main of slow roasted pork didn't disappoint either and had fantastic crackling and beautifully flavored meat. We also shared a side of garlic potatoes which i very highly recommend, as well as there homemade wheaten stout bread that we had as a nibble before out starters came... it really wet the pallet.\n\nTo finish off I had the gorgeous chocolate pot that came with a shot of hazelnut liquor and melt in the mouth shortbread, i couldn't have had a better end to my meal, while my husband enjoyed some wonderful Aged Mull Cheddar. \n\nTheir menu is fairly priced, great fresh food at a great price. They offer an a' la carte menu as well as a set menu of 2 courses for \u00a39 or 3 courses for \u00a310.50, offered between 12pm - 2:30pm and 5pm - 6pm.There wine selection is good and they offer a great range of real ales, much to my husband's delight.\n\nIf you love local seasonal food then this is definitely a place that you need to try and we will certainly be frequenting there again.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "A coworker took me out to Bia Bistrot for my birthday the other week (24 November, if you have your diaries out ...).  Neither of us had been since it changed from an Olive Branch, and that coupled with it's very convenient location, made it a must try.  They advertise a two course lunch or dinner for a very reasonable price.\n\nI generally can't be bothered with two courses for lunch so was pleased when the waitress was happy to let us order single courses off the set menu.\n\nMy coworker decided to try the cumberland sausage with mash, and I went for a salad with poached egg and haggis.\n\nI heard good things about the sausage and mash, but probably not as good as my salad.  I'd never thought of putting haggis on a salad before - I don't really know why, I'll put any other type of meat on a salad - but wow, this was fantastic.  The haggis was sliced, so it had a crispy outside but broke apart easily and went wonderfully witih the salad leaves.\n\nI do love a good poached egg but I am very very very picky, and this one unfortunately was pretty underdone to my taste.  I have to have a liquid yolk but absolutely can't stand if the white is anything but completely cooked.  If I can do it at home, why is it so much of a stuggle to find that when I'm paying someone to cook the egg for me??\n\nIn any case, the food was in general quite nice, and the wine and service were excellent.  Two mains and two glasses of wine came to \u00a322 - a wee bit more expensive than I would have expected for lunch, but overall very nice.

Not pretentious, but neither was it dull. The important thing was that the ingredients are well sourced and excellent, and then compiled into well balanced and delightful combinations. The staff too were friendly and helpful without being either too attentive or too absent, as seems to happen too often. And the ambience is perfect, neither too noisy nor too quiet.

I've always been tempted by it and had fancied trying it for awhile. The lunch and early evening (til 6pm) menu prices suit my student budget so it was always on the to-do list.\nDespite being a large group and arriving later than planned, staff were great and still allowed us to order off the early menu. There are around 4 choices for each course and (I think) its around \u00a311 for 3 courses, before 6pm.\n\nThinking we'd be on the cheap menu and the portions would be small was a mistake. Portions are a decent size and food is great. I had a terrine to start with and it came with gluten free bread (toasted) which was lovely as usually it is only higher-end restaurants that would offer this. Lovely gamey flavours, complemented by a (apple?) compote. My main was chicken and mash potatoes - winter is coming, I need comfort food and this is a good test of a restarant being able to cook a basic dish well. The chicken was cooked to perfection - lovely crispy skin with tender meat underneath and perfect mash, lovely and creamy with no lumps. I loved the gravy (ok for GF) with a hint of tarragon in it, just lovely comfort goodness. We shared sides of carrots and savoy cabbage which were good and I tried some very garlicky potatoes which were great (crispy on the outside, fluffy inside).\n\nFor pudding, I opted for the coffee chocolate pot. Again ok for GF (without shortbread) and my portion came in a large ramekin, so although I was special (no shortbread), I had infact been spoiled by a larger portion which was lovely and a nice touch. I noticed some colleagues didn't like the chocolate pot - I loved it as the coffee was strong enough to flavour but not overpower the chocolate but it is probably one of those deserts you would either love or hate.\n\nTalking to colleagues, they were full of praise. Several had opted for the terrine and a fish pie for the main which was meant to be awesome. As it was a work do, I'm not sure if colleagues had ordered more expensive wine than I usually would or if this was the standard pricing (\u00a323 per bottle) as this might make this a more expensive night out than planned, so 4 stars still I can confirm the booze prices...\nI would go back to Bia Bistrot - great food and service and fab value if you eat early or at lunch.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 2, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "I think Bia Bistrot will always hold a special spot because it was one of the first restaurants I visited in this city.

We stood under a church canopy on the Holy Corner waiting for the rain to subside.  We quickly ran into Tesco to dry off but then realised we were hungry (and thirsty for something to take the edge off us being completely drenched!) Across the road we saw a packed bistro that looked very cosy. I recall there was only one table left and we quickly sat down. We both enjoyed a fantastic meal - I had venison which was cooked perfectly. It was such a memorable restaurant, that whenever my uncle visits me we make a point of coming here for dinner. The staff are very friendly and you can tell the chef takes real pride in the food. Bia Bistrot really lives up to being, \"fresh, local, seasonal, sustainable, and homemade\".
