I still contact this spa (from North Carolina!) to mail-order their sugar butter body scrub and lotion -- it is the BEST!  \n\nIf you are in Phoenix and need spa services or just a manicure/pedicure, I recommend calling Tocasierra.  At the time we were in Arizona, we read that Tocasierra was rated one of the top ten spas in the state so you may be better off getting an appointment instead of hoping for walk-in luck.

Good classes on the schedule, and plenty of cold water and fresh towels.\n\nNow, the spa, on the other hand, is mediocre at best.  The pool is a bit of a walk and available to anyone at the hotel; same with the jacuzzi, which also means the jacuzzi is outside!  Why no jacuzzi inside?  The steam room is small and there is no sauna.  There are only 3 shower stalls, with shampoo and shower gel, but no conditioner. The lounge area is also small and not at all relaxing.  And the robes are super thin (with a chilly room; that's not even nice!) and not very big.  I had to sit very carefully so as to not expose myself to everyone. Hello! haha.\n\nThe massage itself was very nice, but the spa is not relaxing, especially for the prices.

My employer has a corporate account with the center, which brings the price down to just under a dollar a day! You can't beat the price. \n\nA decent range of classes are included in membership, from Yoga to Strength training. I haven't tried any classes yet, but I've heard that they're good. \n\nThe fitness center isn't big, but it's fairly complete. There are several cardio options, a full set of dumbbells and around ten machines. One other plus, they have an honest to god bench press. Machines just don't cut it. A pool is available as well. It's big enough to do laps in, so that's a plus. \n\nOver the years I've found that one of the most relaxing things I can do is work out on my lunch break. I get my head straight for the rest of the day and I don't have to feel guilty about being lazy in the evening. Thanks to Tocasierra I can do this! \n\nI should also mention that the staff is very friendly and helpful.

I had a membership there through work for a few years but truthfully I would not pay full price for this gym myself.  It's very high priced for what they offer.\n\nOn a positive note, the facility is small and non threatening (good for those like me who are not really gym people overall).  All the machines are well kept and you can easily get access to one right away.  They offer a ton of free weights and a schedule of classes.  I'm a HUGE fan of the yoga workshop by Sherry.  She really describes the postures and why they are good for your body.  It's a wonderful class to take for beginners to yoga to really understand the full benefits of the practice.  I can't speak for the other classes but they seem like fun and have people religiously attending them. \n\nOverall a great low key gym located at the Squaw Peak Hilton Resort.

I made reservations in advance to make sure that the spa could accommodate everyone at once.  We selected this spa because we were all staying at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak, so the location was convenient, and they were offering happy hour pricing that fit our budget.  The spa is located across a parking lot from one of the hotel buildings, and is relatively easy to find.  My husband and I arrived first, were handed big fluffy robes and directed to the men's and women's locker/waiting rooms to change and prepare for our appointments.  The locker rooms were lush, with ginger scented lotion and soap, a cedar sauna, showers, and a relaxing waiting room with iced tea and cucumber water available for refreshment.  \n\nI enjoyed a facial by Barbara. She did a wonderful job, analyzing my skin, suggesting and applying treatments most beneficial for my skin type. I was left refreshed, and for the first time ever did not break out after the treatment.  I also had a pedicure, which prepped my feet for a week of desert hiking, pool(ing?), and flipflop shuffling. Even after all that abuse, they still looked great. It has been two weeks, and the polish on my toes hasn't chipped a bit!\n\nMy husband enjoyed a massage and pedicure.  He said that he loved both. My other family members seemed to equally love their experiences.  \n\nIn all, I think this place is awesome. The facility's ambiance is perfect for anyone seeking the zen relaxing spa atmosphere. The people providing the spa services were very professional.  The price, reduced due to the happy hour rates, was just right.\n\nIf I ever make my way back here again, I will definitely stop by.  If they are offering a few deals, I will probably treat myself to another spa experience!

I would have enjoyed the spa facility more if the had an indoor jacuzzi and a more comfortable quiet room.  Also, I used to Burke Williams because I thought they would have some fruits available like apples and bananas. Nope. \n\nWell my deep tissue massage was disappointing.  She asked me what i wanted her to focus on, i said my waist up: no legs or arms. In the middle of the massage, she even asked me if there was anything I wanted. I said, could you work on my knots.  She didn't. Additionally maybe this is how it's done, but I was on my stomach for the entire 50 minutes. I thought she would at least ask me to turn over to stretch my neck etc. Instead I was bruised up at the base of my skull while she was pressing down.

There was very little \"tour\" given. As in, I was shown to my locker and wasn't even told how to function it, had to ask one of the other spa goers. They had a steam room (which is tucked in a weird corner in the locker room), which I didn't even know about until the end of my visit after I was fully dressed and ready to leave, which totally bummed me out, had I known about it I would have taken full advantage of it. \n\nMy first service was my massage. It was one of the worst I have ever had. The guy seriously talked THE.WHOLE.ENTIRE.TIME. Oi Vey! aaaaaaaaaaand he seriously worked me over so hard that I was sore for 2 days afterward, I've never had that happen. \n\nHOWEVER, my second service was a facial and it was top notch.
