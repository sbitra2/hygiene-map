I must admit the spinach artichoke dip and nachos are ALWAYS good.  \nAs for beer, the brewmaster left sometime in 2004, and the Angelic hasn't been the same since.  They have a decent selection of tap beers, but I am quite sad that I may never taste their trippel or doubel ever again.  There are fair priced drink specials to draw you there on the weekdays.

Shared a Dirty Dog IPA- very nicely hoppy, mean but not too mean that it can't be more than a single session beer. Got a 2nd more mellow beer, the Tailwagger Wheat, a hefeweisen beer.

I got potato salad because no one ever has that as a side choice. It was pretty good, a little heavy on the sauce on the pork, but it was decent. the salad was mayo based and used redskin potatoes- definitely not bad. \n\nBF had chicken tenders in the hot honey sauce which comes with celery and carrots but BF added a potato salad as well.

This began with a food love affair of fried Wisconsin walleye at the now long-boarded-up Holy Cow! just across from the now shuttered and defunct Sahara Hotel & Casino. When that fine eatery closed, I began frequenting one of its sisters: Big Dog's Draft House on Rancho Drive.  It is known for very tasty comfort food at all hours, large portions, and excellent brews. I cannot vouch for the brews, because after a bout with gout a few years ago, I stopped drinking alcoholic beverages altogether--even wine.  I guess that is the price one must sometimes pay for several decades of fine dining while savoring rich foods high in purine content like Escargot, Sweetbreads, and shellfish. So, you will never hear me extol the virtues of various cocktails or vintages in any of my reviews. I can, however, vouch for the root beer at Draft House, which is home brewed and excellent but heavy enough on the gut that I have not yet finished a large glassful.  So, I usually opt for Sprite or Coca-Cola instead. Free refills are cheerfully provided, and on this latest outing I polished off three large glassfuls of Coke. \n\nMy purpose in going to Draft House on this particular evening was to try out items on its new dinner menu.  But imagine my surprise when pan-fried Potstickers were no longer on the menu!  I had ordered them every time I had been here, because they were large and excellent, and served with a really kickin' Asian dipping sauce.  When I asked my server if Potstickers were nevertheless still available, she took on a sad look and said, \"Unfortunately not, and neither is the large quesadilla, which was really great, too,\" as if she had fielded this question at least 20 times before already.  I think this is a foolish mistake by restaurant management, because I am sure that the Potstickers were a best seller, and now I and others have less incentive to come here.  My wife even wanted me to dock the restaurant a star on account of the elimination of this great appetizer, but I refused to do so.  It is well and good to tweak a menu now and then, but not throw out one of your best items to make room for another questionable offering like Southwestern Stuffed Pork Chops that are filled with roasted Poblano chiles, chorizo, and smoked Gouda cheese and drizzled with a spicy chorizo-tomato cream sauce.  \n\nSo, as an appetizer we grudgingly ordered a Bavarian Soft Pretzel that was served with sweet beer mustard instead.  This new menu item was large enough for two to share, supple, and very good--as was the sweet mustard for dipping.  It was also very salty, with several salt crystals adhering to the dough of the pretzel.  But the crystals could easily be brushed off by hand to attain the level of saltiness desired. \n\nNext I tried the new Pulled Pork Sliders, which were very good, except all buns were completely dry and not enough barbecue sauce remained after cooking.  The pulled pork wasn't dry but it wasn't very saucy either.  My suspicion is that some of the sauce had leached into the cooked onion straws that topped the meat.  So, I asked for more barbecue sauce, and received it.  When asked, the server said that it was Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce.  Adding more cold sauce catapulted the sliders into the excellent-quality range, but they would likely have been even tastier if more sauce had been COOKED with the meat. The accompanying German potato salad was superb, as always. It was difficult to finish all three sliders, but that is probably a good thing. \n\nMy wife enjoyed the Golden Fried Shrimp appetizer, which, although no longer on the menu either, the chef was able to provide.  I sampled one morsel of the eight plump fantail shrimp that arrived at the table, and it was juicy and succulent. The skin-on french fries that came with this dish were also very tasty: crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. \n\nWe finished up with another new dish: Big Dog's Key Lime Pie, which was excellent: appropriately yellow in color, tart, and redolent of lime flavor with sumptuous and creamy whipped cream spread on the back of the top of the generous slice, and sporting a delicate and crunchy graham cracker crust on the bottom.  It was like a very good cheesecake but lighter, and reminded me of Miami Beach Key Lime Pie, which is a great compliment to Draft House's pastry chef.  \n\nService was friendly, fast, and efficient.  Ambiance was that of a typical, fairly dark, and woody pub, for we ate in the high-tabled bar area.  The restaurant closes about 9:00 p.m.  But food is available in the tavern all night long.  All in all, if I could, I would have rated this meal 4-1/2 stars.  Only sliders that were light on sauce blocked an earned fifth star on this night out.  But I still had a very satisfying meal.\n\nMessage to Draft House management: Please bring back the Potstickers!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 5, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "Big dogs comes with a little bite.\n\nThis place is okay for the following reasons.\n\nCame with a big party of 9, and didn't feel like our server gave us the attention we deserved.

Priced about average (less than $10)' It's still delicious and taste about the same as other pub and grill joints.\n\n-Fish and Chips:  Deep fried and greasy.  Poke a couple of holes in the breaded fish and drain the greasy out first.  Now you're takin'.  Now it's at least edible.  I think the batter is a little too thick and takes away from the taste of the fish.\n\n-Steak:  Not a bad option, but it's a little dry.  However, it's cheap and you get what you pay for.\n\n-Pizza:  Has to be over 2 years since my last pizza here, but it's cheap and one of their better prepared items here.  For less than $10, a personal pizza here is tasty and not too greasy.\n\n-Burgers:  2nd favorite to their pizza.

I'm not a huge fan of nitro beers, but this one was creamy, had a great whiskey barrel taste with lots of deep coffee notes. Overall, great beer.

Chicken, Mushroom, & Barley Soup with celery, soft carrots, and tendrils of fresh falling apart chicken is very good, as well.     \n\nThe beef in Big Dog's Beef Stroganoff has always been all lean beef, with hand cut large Button Mushrooms, and an ample dab of sour cream placed atop Stroganoff Sauce (similar to Swedish Meatballs Sauce) liberally spread over an abundance of egg noodles.  This is a nice and heat hot, filling dish.\n\nA Bavarian Pretzel was really salty, as expected, but soft: good with provided Mustard Sauce but I liked it better simply smeared with butter.

Later in the evening, our curiosity prompted us to ask the server to climb the dog.  When we got the 'good to go,' we literally took a thousand pictures on that statue.  Awesome.  The inside is pretty huge.  It actually reminds me of a local pub in Wisconsin.  Pictures, awards, Wisconsin shaped everything!  The bar is definitely the center piece of the establishment.

Curds were perfectly salty.  We also got the full order of Doghouse Nachos for $14.00.  Chips with cheese, tomatoes, jalape\u00f1os, olives, sour cream, scallions, salsa & guacamole.  This bite reminded me of stadium nachos.  Nothing special, cheese from a can.  Lastly, we got the Chicken Wings for $9.00.  It's served with celery and carrots. You can choose to have the wings plain, BBQ, medium, hot, spicy chipotle or honey hot.  We asked for half BBQ and half medium.  The wing was crispy and perfectly fried.  The mild sauce was my favorite.  The actual sauce didn't seem to over power the wing and really showcased the chicken taste.  The BBQ, on the other hand, seemed to really over power the wing for me.  Super sweet flavor. If they used a little less sauce, I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more.  \n\nAfter all brews and food, our bill was $80 for 4 people.  That's a deal.

The good news is the beers are still awesome.  Had the Winter Wheat - served with a slice of orange and a sprinkle of nutmeg.  Mmmm...\n\nFoodwise, the new, slimmer menu was a bit sad for me.  No more salmon fish & chips and no more meatloaf.  My two Rock Bottom favorites.  Ordered Mac & Chicken and Mac+Chicken+Chorizo.  A side of fries for my picky 2-year old and the badass ballpark pretzels to start.  Now, admittedly, this is bar food and has always been on the salty side, but they've gone a step further.  Now, I do like to binge on hugely salty food once in a while, so I won't say I didn't love it, but I can literally feel it now... Blood pressure meds, here I come...\n\nThe big bummer was the service.  It started out with the hostesses.  Friendly enough, but it was a bit off-putting to be asked twice if we needed a high-chair (and respond twice that no, just a booster would be great) and then end up with no booster.  Walked back up to the front and asked again, no problem.  OK, so far.  So, then, we sit down... and we wait.  No problem, must be busy... Friday night, holiday season at a big shopping spot... but wait, those are empty tables... 6 of 'em in our section the whole time (maybe shoulda taken that as a sign).  \n\nAnyway, after about 5 minutes, our server comes.  She's friendly/pleasant.  We order our drinks and the pretzels.  Drinks come just fine.  Another few minutes later, she returns to take our order.  No problems, but 2 place settings.  3 people.  Hostess doesn't notice.  Waitress doesn't notice.  Then, I see what appears to be a manager stealing settings from one table and putting on another... so, I follow suit and steal one myself.  Problem solved.\n\nAbout 60 seconds later, our lukewarm fries arrive.  Whatever.  Just for the kid.  Appreciate the speed.  That's followed a minute later by my wife's side salad.  About 10 minutes later the pretzels show up, followed by our entries 45 seconds later.  Nice timing.  Then, the kid starts griping about no ketchup.  Hmmm... that's odd... Fries, but no ketchup and no ask from the server.  Whatever. So another couple minutes goes by, and we see our server flying by and flag her down.  Ketchup for all.\n\nDuring this time, I overhear the table behind me working through a problem with their bill (charged for 3 beers they never ordered or drank).\n\nIf this were a Denny's, I'd be more than pleased with the service.  But, maybe I'm getting picky/cheap in my old age, but it feels like it's kinda shoddy for a $25/head meal.  \n\nOur waitress was pleasant and earnest, but clearly undertrained.  The several tables left unbussed around us for the duration of our meal was also a clear indicator.  The three hostesses on duty unable to effectively service a light crowd was another sign.  This place clearly has systemic management issues.  \n\nWon't be coming back to this location (though I'll keep an eye on the GM sign in the window and try it again when it changes again).

Having been frequent patrons of the M/resort we decided to give Anthony's Burgers and Brews a try for the first time. From Top to Bottom that was the worst experience, service wise we have experienced. We walked up to the empty podium for starters, after 3 minutes a young lady walks up, doesn't apologize, and I ask if there is seating available outside, she says its open seating out there and we say okay and start making our way over to the patio and she yells and say you'll need some menus, and hands them too us and we walk ourselves out to the patio. We then sit for approximately 15 minutes waiting for someone to acknowledge our existence. So I physically have to get up and flag someone down and ask to be waited on. 5 minutes after that, a Casino Floor Cocktail waitress, not a server, came to take or order. She was nice but clearly didn't know the menu and seem to struggle with remembering what we ordered. We sit there for another 10 minutes and we don't get our drinks, water or appetizers. So I get up again and grab the manager and let her know we are having a problem, she apologizes and acts like she is going to take care of the issue. 5 minute later a runner brings out our drinks so we get our first drinks after 40 minutes!!!!! As we sit there and start to drink we watch the hostess seat a table near us and it just flat out makes you feel like we were not good enough to seat or serve, enough was enough and we got up and left, telling the manager on the way out that that was terrible and we will not be back. So we lost an hour there and had to skip our happy hour and we went to Republic Kitchen and Bar and had excellent service and food. Its really unfortunate, we planned on spending the day at M pool but really don't want to relive that experience so we have opted to change that plan as well.

A group of us came on a Monday night, so no crowds. The servers were all very friendly and accommodating for our large group of 8. \n\nEach of the burgers on the menu is conveniently named after the recommended beer pairing. I believe each burger was in the range of $10-15 for a 10oz. patty. Pretty good deal. The burgers come with the lettuce, tomato, onions, and pickle on the side for you to put in as you like.\n\nConsidering majority of the group was male, most of the orders were for the Imperial burger that is stacked high with stout braised short rib. I had a taste of the Imperial and it was cooked well, but the selling point was the short rib and no one was blown away by it. The short rib was shredded but had no other real flavor of its own so it was just meat on top of meat. Not a bad burger, but a little disappointed by it.\n\nI wanted to get something different so we could try more on the menu. I ordered the IPA to stand out from the group. I liked my burger a lot more. It had grilled chilies, pepper jack cheese, and fried jalapenos on a bbq spiced patty. I like my food with a little kick and this burger had flavor and a kick. Cooked well and seasoned nicely. \n\nWe also ordered 3 types of fries to go around: truffle, garlic and Parmesan, and the bacon and cheddar. The favorite of the table seemed to be the garlic and Parmesan. The fries are nice and thick cut but still crispy. However they seemed to have a heavy hand with the truffle oil, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the truffle flavor was a little overwhelming considering it also came with a truffle dipping sauce. The bacon and cheddar ones tasted just like a baked potato. \n\nOverall, we had a nice dining experience and the burgers are a real deal for the price.

The hostess taking my reservation was the same one who was there to greet us with a table already made up for the group, and she was fine with a couple of us waiting for more from our party to show up.   So far so good.\n\nOnce the majority of the party (6 of 8) had shown up, we decided to be seated and we immediately asked the waiter if we could do separate checks.  He said that they do not do that there.  \"At all?\"  \"Right.  Never\"   We shrugged it off as no big deal and started ordering drinks.  I've had Jack and Cokes all throughout this great city of ours and I gotta say this was a piss poor example.  Very watered down, and no surprise that 4 of them later I barely had a buzz going.  Strike one.  I ordered the IPA Burger with Sweet Potato fries (I'm a sweet potato slut).   Several at my table ordered a variety of other burgers and fries.  Most of us ordered our own order of fries and when they came out there were way too many for each individual to eat.  I thought it would have been nice for the server to maybe say each order could feed 2, but I won't hold them to that.  I personally loved the sweet potato fries with the maple sauce, even though it tastes exactly as it sounds: very syrupy, very rich.   Others at my table werent nearly as impressed.  They are much skinnier than I am.  The burger was quite simply a disappointment.  The meat was alright, and prepared the way I ordered (medium rare), but the problem was the lack of flavor outside of the meat itself.  The IPA is supposed to have a BBQ spiced burger patty, roasted hatch chilies, pepper jack cheese and fried jalapenos.   I honestly never felt a kick in the least.  Another at my table that also ordered it said the same.  Not sure how that is possible with those ingredients.  Seasoning in general needed work, and I heard from someone else at my table with the Imperial that the short ribs were flavorless (a sentiment I've seen shared by others here).  Maybe it's the pumped in oxygen into the M that somehow renders these burgers nearly tasteless.\n\nOverall service was fairly pleasant, and they even hooked me up with a free jack and coke for my birthday, and replaced a spilled one (no I swear, I wasnt drunk) for free.   BUT, at the end of the meal, the waiter comes up with our check, and announces that the last couple to arrive asked for their check to be split.  WAIT WHAT?  A few of us immediately brought up the fact that earlier he said they dont do that at ALL.  We were promptly ignored.  Look, I get that he initially wanted to not split the check probably for the forced 18% gratuity or what have you, but there's no need to lie about it.  \n\nBe thankful you hooked me up with those free jack and cokes and that I'm such a whore for sweet potato fries and maple syrup Anthony's, I'm being generous with my 2.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 4, "useful": 4, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "Simple menu, complex burger, amazing sides and just simply delicious.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "It's crazy.

Comparing his burgers to Wendy's, McDonalds, Denny's, or even Fuddruckers (which I enjoy greatly) is like comparing apples to cheese covered 10oz Angus beef patties. They are in the IVY league of burgers my friends. I ordered the Pilsar. The beef was exquisite and, for most, there'd probably be enough of it left over AFTER you eat; to walk (OK, drive) over to the Mirage and throw a snack to the tigers (Something I don't recommend in any way... I was merely being discriptive; moving on). I didn't like that the already expensive burger ($13) didn't come with french fries, but it was a pretty big burger which leads me to believe most people wouldn't be able to finish it AND fries.\n\nTrue to name, and form, I DID order french fries with mine. :-) \n\nThe fries were delicious. I've said it's nearly impossible to ruin french fries, but then I went to Hash House a-GO-GO and was quickly confronted with the COLD reality that I'm not always right. They were cut thin, seasoned just right and a half order served as more than enough to accompany the hefty burger. They, along with the burger, were a bit pricey ($4.50 for a half order).  I usually don't talk about the service at any restaurant unless it effects the food (i.e. I see the tray with my food ready to be brought to my table but it sits on a counter for 10 minutes) but our waiter was especially attentive and educated on the menu.

It was delicious.  Others have said it was overkill, but I think that was kind of the point.  It had great flavor and it was decadent.  My dining companions had the Lager Burger (with onions, mushrooms, and cheese) and the Pilsner Burger (cheese and pilsner sauce).  Both got high marks as well.  One of my dining companions also noted that the garlic parmesan fries were the among the best fries he's ever had - a glowing review to be sure.\n\nPerhaps the best part of Anthony's is the beer selection.  Several craft bottles are available for $5.  Considering some strip casinos charge more for cans of bud light, this is a great value.  The only thing that would improve the beer selection is if Anthony's could tap into the draft selection at 32 Degrees across the casino floor.\n\nM Resort is not too far from my house and I'm there frequently.  Anthony's Gourmet Burgers & Brews is one of my favorite places to go when I want a great burger for a decent price.\n\nOne side note - what's with the chairs?

She returned with the same burgers, just with the mushrooms scraped off. Really?!?! OMG....so angry. \n\nWe politely told her these were again, NOT what we ordered and did not just want the mushrooms scraped off.

You also have the option to add fries for another $5. They have different flavors and toppings, however, I just chose the salt and pepper fries. Man, what an amazing burger!

I already had my order planned and ready before I arrived.\n\nGuacamole Burger with Sweet Potato Fries- 3.5-stars- I ordered this one cooked to medium. At first, I couldn't find the guacamole, but it was under the cheese packed in tight. So it wasn't as gooey or squishy as I had first anticipated. The burger itself was quite juicy, and had a hint of salt which stood out. There is also a lot of olives between the meat and cheese as well. Between the tomato and lettuce was some surprisingly fresh red onions--it definitely hits you fast. I'm usually a fan of caramelized onions on my burgers. The sweet potato fries were average, yet crispy and delicious, as fries should be.\n\nCrab and Artichoke Dip- 3.5-stars- The crab flavor hits immediately, and you can tell this is soaked with crab. The amount of oil was a bit off-putting for me, since it made me feel sluggish and tired. Little balls I thought were potatoes, my mother confirmed was indeed artichoke hearts. This is served with tortilla chips and flat bread. I would go with the bread to slather on the dip. Otherwise, your chips will crack under the hefty weight!\n\nLoco Moco- 3-stars- I ended my trip the way I started, at the Triple Seven Microbrewery, as I waited for our shuttle to arrive. I ordered it medium rare, as I like to have some blood in the morning--I also hear, I sparkle in the sunlight. Either way, this one comes with a thick brown gravy, which seemed a good fit, but the flavor was overpowering. A mix of salty and robust, it overwhelmed the other ingredients. The egg, I ordered sunny-side-up. The burger was just a burger at this rate. Served hot enough, my tongue was a little singed for a day. The plate was definitely filling, but not too exciting over-all.\n\nBlackchip Porter- 4.5-stars- I'm a lover of dark beers. I love the deep woodsy flavor which washes around in your mouth. This porter also has an earthy, chocolate flavor when you drink it. Served with a thick lather of froth on top. Definitely a beer worth trying.\n\nAtmosphere- They really keep the look of the train station here. Huge glass windows show off their giant microbrewery, housing all their different beers. The wide open-space takes away from the look of a bar, which would be great for a place like this, and makes way for an almost family dining environment. Tons of tables and seats, rarely filled--since the next-door Garden Court attracts the big eaters. There is a lot which could be done with this place, and it's not out of reach either.\n\nService- Service is decently fast, with a touch of Aloha--since this is a very local hotel the way it's run. The meals were delivered quickly, and there are television screens all around to watch the games and sports-reels.\n\nConclusion- A good place when you're not feeling the buffet. The hours are pretty generous from 11 a.m. to 7 a.m., definitely a place to stop when you want a drink and something to eat after long hours of 20x odds on craps, slots, or blackjack tables.

I wished I had some Hawaiian chili pepper water from back home.  The wait staff is very friendly and attentive.\n\nThe second visit was later at night--about 2 am.  They were still bustling.

That's telling for me, because usually a place will have a few duds, and you just have to learn what not to order.  Trust me when I say the Triple 7 always delivers good food.  I read other reviews refer to this place as a gem, and they are correct.  It's what you want when you look to a meal you can enjoy at any hour.\n\nSome of my \"Must Try\" recommendations are the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich, Triple 7 Wings (when you're taking down a few of their Triple 7 Brews), Monterey Chicken Sandwich, Fish & Chips, or my drunken go to: Baked Italian Sub.  \n\nLook, I could go on and on, if you're looking for a solid meal and you're downtown, this is by far the best place to eat at.

Kinda of a Gordin Biersch type of feel.  Huge breweries on one side and kitchen on the other.\n\nService:\nFor the most part the 6 times I've eaten here went problem free. Sure most of the times its been after midnight when it was slow but all the waiters/waitresses have been more than adequate.  Beware of the weird hours.\n\nCost:\nPrices will run you around 7-11$ per person but overall its pretty cheap.  If you're getting sushi(in which I never have) each item will run you about 3-4$ which can easily get pricey. During happy hour(3-6pm M-F) they have a decent happy hour of $5 appetizers and better yet $2 beer & wines.  If you happen to be from Hawaii and are here with \"Vacations Hawaii\" then this restaurant participates in the food voucher program but your selection is kind of limited to mostly burgers and appetizers.\n\nFood:\nSo I've been here 6 times and for the most part I haven't been impressed.

The gravy was your typical packaged powered gravy that you would buy for $0.75 in the store.  If you go here stick with a simple burger or the pizzas have looked good\n\nConclusion:\nTriple 7 looks the part of a good brewery restaurant but just doesn't cut it on the food end.

I didn't order off the express menu though, and decided to go with a burger since that's what a friend recommended I try. I went with the San Francisco burger which uses grilled sourdough bread instead of buns. The burger was great and cooked medium like I had asked for. \n\nWe sat at the bar and the bartender was really nice and attentive throughout the meal. When we left, he asked if we worked in the area and then proceeded to fill out a couple stamp/punch cards and handed them to us. Ask for one if you're a local, you'll get a free meal after 5 weekday lunch purchases. \n\nOverall this place was great, both food and staff. I will have to return for some brews after hours.

Though Sin City might indeed be the creator of many sinful provocations and temptations, \"humble\" isn't a word that comes to mind readily. However, visiting the little brother of The Strip and spending time in Downtown Las Vegas had the benefit of finding a nook, a corner to sit in where the smoke of cigarettes and waves of slot machines faded to a hum. Brick walls and copper colored beer vats instead took place and slowly, it's easy to phase into a history mixed with old speakeasies and modern day breweries like BJ's. Triple 7 Restaurant & Microbrewery welcomed everyone back to the brewing days.\n\nDeco: 4 stars\n\nThe interior is surprisingly large. Although located inside Main Street Casino, walking in felt like you were inside one half of a giant brewery, waiting to be explored like an adult in Willy Wonka's beer factory. Large copper vats can be seen and old saloon ceiling fans churned the atmosphere. Flat screen TVs showcased the latest in sports and a huge open dining floor with no partitions to be seen showcased the large space available for accommodation. There is no glitz and glamour of a showgirl here. Simply the girl-next-door humble look we all learn to love one day at a time.\n\nService: 3 stars\n\nThe service was friendly, almost down right Southern. The server was pleasant, introducing the different specials of the day as well as the selection of beers that are brewed within the very walls you find yourself. However, as tantalizing as the descriptions for food and drink might have been, it was a bit slow. Hopefully you are in no hurry.\n\nFood & Drink: 4 stars\n\nThe great thing about a simple place is they give you simple, delicious food in large quantity. Sure, this isn't Bouchon or Mesa Grill but it doesn't have to be. There is no need for comparison because the food tastes great for what it is: traditional American cuisine made with good ingredients and lots of generosity in portion sizes. The burgers are juicy with crunchy, savory breads. The fries are crisp with a texture perfect for sauces. The salads are huge and filling for vegetarian and omnivores alike. Come hungry and you'll leave full. Come famished and you'll leave satisfied.\n\nAnd because they brew and create their own hoppy libations on site, you as a diner have the pleasure to sample and indulge on truly unique beers you can only find here. The porter was delicious with that oaky, smokey, caramel aftertaste after each sip. The amber ale was as golden as a Swede's hair in summer. Plus like every brewery, there are flights to be had and spirits to enjoy. If for nothing else, you should come for the beer.\n\nPrice: 4 stars\n\nThe price might not be the cheapest in the land, hovering around the same price you would pay at a Hoff's Hut or BJ's, but you get so much for your money. It never feels like you've been cheated out of your money or you made a gamble by coming here, which is a great feeling considering all the dangerous that your wallet will face before or after dining here. Instead, just like the food, you feel satisfied.\n\nConclusion\n\nMany people won't know about this wonderful brewery. Even more people will find it hard to believe you. But once you come here and truly experience what a gem this place really is, you'll be wondering why you never came before. From the artisan beers to the tranquility within the storm of chaos all around, Triple 7 Restaurant is truly unique and worth experiencing. You'll make a lot of bad choices during your stay in Sin City.

I watched as server after server wandered around the room asking \"did you order...?\"\n\nMy biggest issues here were definitely the problems I don't see them resolving with some simple management.\n\n1. I like beer.  I like craft brews and love microbreweries because you can get something completely new.  Not here. I tried every beer they had on tap, except the one they said wasn't ready yet.  The pale ale was decent, but murky and boring. The hefe had a strong vinegar smell, but luckily tasted a little bit better with a strong banana residual flavor.  The James Brown nut ale had the most character, but at the end of the night, was just a nut brown.  The ESB was boring...little flavor and too dark for the style. \nOverall, I enjoyed the guest taps much more.  The Great Divide saison and the Four Peaks black IPA were much more interesting and worth calling craft beers. \n\n2. The food. What a disaster.  I sat with a group of 4.  We ordered their pretzel bread, which I think is just rye bread with pretzel salt on it.  It didn't have much flavor.  The three dips it came with were decent though. I don't eat seafood so the choices for dinner were limited.  There was chicken, burger, bangers and mash, or shepherd's pie.  We ultimately ordered three of these.\n\nWhich all came out about 5-10 minutes apart.\n\nThe chicken was a drumstick and thigh on about 3/4 cup rice.  VERY salty and mostly just a teriyaki taste.

While the pretzel bread was good the three sauces that came with it were the bomb! My only complaint was there was not enough of them in the little cups. My wife loved the crab dip and the mussels. The burgers were good but needed bacon. We were told after we had eaten that it could be added but no one mentioned it to us and it wasn't on the menu. The servers were very friendly and apologetic on some of the misses. The beer was good. Not great but not bad. I tried the Hefe and the Pale Ale.\n\nSo the misses. And these were pretty big misses.  I was the first person to get my plate and my fries were ice cold. Totally inedible! Between the time I got my plate and the last person on our table got his plate was more than 10 minutes. I was done with my meal completely by the time the last person started digging in. The Mac and Cheese, had no cheese on it at all. It was just bland noodles with what  were supposed to be peas in it but I only saw maybe 2 peas. They should just take this off the menu!!! It was by the far the worst thing we ate!\n\nMy other complaint is really kind of my own. The place seems to be a geared towards a seafood menu. Out of our entire party, only two people liked seafood. When I think beer, I think burgers and meat and manly food. When I think seafood I think wine. Maybe that is what the owner is looking to change, but with only just 3 or 4 things on the menu not seafood I think they are doing a disservice.\n\nOverall, there are a dozen other brewhouses in Phoenix that serve fantastic food and fantastic beer. I really hope North Mountain Brewing gets their act together, there is nothing on that side of town and it could use it! I will be back in a month or so to see if they can get things together.

I had bookmarked them after stopping by their booth at the Strong Beer Festival in February but they are pretty far from where we live so I hadn't gotten around to paying them a visit even though I have seen some pretty good reviews from fellow Yelpers. Unfortunately we had just had a huge meal so we did not sample any of the food but I did try all four beers that they had on tap that day. Their production facility is pretty small so they don't make a whole lot but the nice thing is they do also keep some other local brews on tap so you are sure to find something you would like to drink.\n\nI tried the four that they make themselves. First off was their Funk 49 wheat ale, similar to a Hefeweizen but with a bit more flavor. It was a nice light beer, perfect for summer, and had a pleasant mild taste with a crisp citrus aftertaste. Hubby ordered one of those put an orange in it, as he is wont to do. Next we tried the CREEM Ale. This one was a bit lighter than I was expecting but surprisingly enough I really liked it and ended up ordering a pint. I can't remember how they categorized it but to me it was like a very mild red ale but with some really strong caramel undertones. We also tried their pale ale which as expected was a bit too hoppy for me and their Nonpartisan lager which also as expected was too tasteless (nothing against NMB, I just don't care for pale ales or lagers). I look forward to trying their stout some day since that one sounds great!\n\nWe had a great time chatting with the friendly bartender. Everyone working there seemed really nice and they greeted most folks by name as they entered (it was the middle of the day so they were not busy). Even though the interior looks brand spanking new and everything was pretty shiny and modern, it still had a homey feel to it since the space was small and very open. Also, the smells coming from the kitchen were mouth watering and their menu looks fantastic. I love the fact that they have some traditional pub food but then throw in some unexpected twists. They even had some Vietnamese items on there. Apparently they just lost their chef so they may be reworking the menu soon, though. And it sounds like their beers change all the time.

Because I was rushed I picked a beer that wouldn't have been my 1st choice had I been given more time to look. Oof. ANYWAY, I digress - I chose a pint of West St.Mungo lager (had it before, really like it) Now I don't know if I imagined this but I swore I seen Brooklyn Lager on the menu after I had already ordered and I do *love* a pint of Brooklyn so I was kicking myself that I had felt rushed into ordering. Dang. \n\nService was swift - the waitress that brought our drinks also then took our food order. This place specialises in quality burgers of all kinds. But fear not my vegetable loving friends! They DO cater for the veggies - with 4 types of veggie burgers on their menu amongst other non-animal dishes too. Also on their menu was tasty sounding breakfasts (only served til 12 Noon though...not very good for us late risers), various salads (who orders a salad when there's burgers on the menu?!) and other types of meaty sarnies. \n\nI opted for the (unadventurous) Cheese Burger and my boy ordered the Cheese and Bacon Burger. Both arrived swiftly and made my eyes go 'BOOOIIIINNNGGG!' like in the cartoons of old. Our HUGE burgers came on a wooden slab to make us feel even more Paleolithic-like (Ug!) and served alongside were lovely skinny crisp fries and a wee bowl of fancy coleslaw. Also in the burger was a delicious beer mustard mayo and the usual dill pickle, lettuce and tomato. I had to halve my BEAST BURGER coz being a dainty fingered lady (Ha ha) I could not handle that cow sandwich all in one go. \n\nAll was very tasty and along with the beer I was one very satisfied lady indeed. After eating I thought in my wee head wouldn't it be grand to have a bar like this in Glasgow. There most probably is one but I've not came across it yet. \n\nOnly downside was the teeny-tiny ladies toilets. Made me feel like a giant and when a place serves such good burgers they cannot expect all their lady patrons to be the size of Victoria Beckham.

Unfortunately the location of that wee gem does not favour me as a local.\n\nEnter Holyrood 9A. Located a perfect 5 minute walk from work, this is one of THE after-work bars in Edinburgh. \n\nSituated just off the crossroads between the Pleasance and St. Mary's Street, 9A offers a stylish setting to the office crowd, students and regulars of its old incarnation (name escapes me... little help?) alike. The slick interior has a warm charm about it that many modern bars fail to deliver, making it an easy choice for a quick drink or a bite.\n\nSpeaking of which... although 9A can boast a trendy-yet-not-central-bar claim, the ace up their sleeve is their extensive and classy range of burgers. The variety alone is enough to drop a jaw here or there. \n\nAnd the quality of their product? Well I probably couldn't count the number of 9A burgers I've had on two hands (I am the Duke after all!), but I've yet to experience a bad one.\n\nScratch that; a mediocre one! They're simply awesome. My firm favourite being the Venison Burger; thick and juicy, topped with a wedge of brie and cranberry relish. Well if that don't have you drooling.... you're probably a vegetarian....!\n\nOther notables are the Haggis Burger, the Pork & Apple, and the Pioneer (topped with rosemary-scented mushrooms,bacon, swiss and a garlic mayo). They do veggie option, they do breakfast, they do finger food, they do desserts, but it's simply all about the burgers at 9A. All come served with a side of red cabbage coleslaw and a cup of fries (upgrade to Piri Piri fries for better days - fact!).\n\n\nOf course it takes a lot for a bar to fall under \"perfect\". 9A has its flaws. The first of which being the prices; the \u00a33.40 mark seems to be the standard for the range of spirits on offer, and although I'm no beer drinker, I hear the asking price for certain tipples are closer to the \u00a35 mark, per pint. High street prices from a bar that sits arguably on the border of student land (Pleasance, Cowgate, et al) is a bit of an ask, and I'm sure if they lowered their prices, they would benefit from increased midweek custom from the student crowds.\n\nThe other blemish on 9A's reputation is short and simple: turn on the bleedin telly! Fair enough the manager maybe doesn't want a rowdy football crowd coming in to watch the FA Cup, but I've seen my fair share of idiots on a Friday afternoon so they're not really keeping that crowd away regardless. And I don't think it's too much to ask that they show the tennis when I ask.\n\nGreat bar, made great by a) the friendly, personable staff (wouldn't be my Cheers bar if they weren't!); b) the quality food served up; and c) the clientele that frequent the joint. A great social regular, marred only by overzealous prices and a stuffy manager.\n\nBut don't let him keep you away.

O en Escocia, en este caso.\n\nPed\u00ed la hamburguesa bohemia, y estaba exquisita. Para refrescar el gaznate, una cerveza llamada Cesar Augustus que estaba estupenda. Y para rematar un enorme postre que llaman \"The Kitchen Sink\" y que son diversos tipos de pudding amenizados con bien de helado.

Unfortunately, because of these bold flavors the beef did not get a chance to stand out on the burger and the bun was only average.
