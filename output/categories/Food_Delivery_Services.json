Very relaxing and refreshing to walk into.\n\nThe menu here is somewhat simple.  Part breakfast, part lunch, with a few options to those who are hungry.  I got the omlette, with tomatos, cheese and onions.  When it the food came out, it was so tasty!!  My mom had the crepes, and said it was the best crepes she has had in some time.   Best breakfast that I have had in some time.  Plus, our server was wonderful!!!

My over-easy eggs were a little raw, but the hash-browns were crispy, just as I had ordered them, and flavorful, with a hint of onion. The bacon was thick and delicious, and the pancakes were yummy in spite of a somewhat chewy texture. The coffee was fine, and I appreciated the giant glasses of water. \n\nThe owners and staff were all very friendly, and when I asked one of them about what was in the pancake batter, she said she would have the chef come to my table. He was a great guy, and admitted that he was disappointed with the texture of the pancakes himself of late, and planned to adjust the recipe. \n\nI'm sure I'll be back to try other items on the menu. It's not the Good Egg where you have an overwhelming 4 page menu, but everything on the Breakfast Joynt's menu is a breakfast or lunch classic. They have healthy options as well, such as fruit and yogurt and items made with only egg-whites. Then again, they also have a Monte Cristo and chicken fried steak.

It's a decent sized glass so I feel like the value is good.  The husband and I both ordered the same thing, biscuits and gravy.  It came with hashbrowns and 2 eggs any way you want it.  We got scrambled and I ordered a side of bacon.  I cannot resist good bacon.  The biscuits and gravy was amazing.  The gravy was smooth and delicious.  It didn't get a nasty skin or congeal-y or anything like that.  There were lots of chunks of sausage in it and the biscuits were super fluffy and tasty.  This is heaven.  A perfect amount of gravy for two perfectly sized biscuits.  The hashbrowns could use some seasoning, but the gravy mixed with them was divine.  The eggs were eggs.\n\nI love this place.

The actual bar is still there, with a flat panel TV in the middle, but surprisingly the shelves are still empty all the way up to the ceiling.  They've only been there around 6 months, so maybe this will change as they settle into the location.  It has a very clean, upscale feel to it - something not out of place in North Scottsdale.

Being from the South, it wasn't thrilling that the biscuits were somewhat small and square shaped, almost like a little dinner roll.  They have their own style (and they've informed me that they are homemade) but I was looking for something more substantial to be smothered in sausage gravy.  The pancakes were not served hot with the other food items, and they seemed to have settled and were somewhat chewy and elastic.\n\nMenu was rather straightforward and clear with sectioned boxes, with a nice highlight of their featured stuffed apple pancake.

I love all their food and drink, and I do not think I've ever had a service issue to complain about. So, this review is going to be all positives. Pretty much you're going to read this for my recommendations!\n\nI always get the same three things here: the beef hot dog and the pepper jack on a stick and a regular lemonade. They're the best things on the menu, I believe, and really the best way to introduce people to HDoaS. See, it's the simple stuff here that delivers. The hot dogs are quality Nathan's (I think) so you're not getting value-brand stuff. It shows when you bite into a hot dog -- the meat is still fairly moist and flavorful, and you can tell it's legit comfort food. The cheese, too, is perfect. It comes out super hot and gooey, and you need to take your time getting to it. There's actually somewhat of a science to this: you can't get to it too quickly or it'll be too hot, and you can't wait too long or it'll be too cool. You really have to Goldilocks it, and my informal scientific study reveals the magic wait time to be around 45 seconds from presentation to consumption. Results may vary, so have the lemonade available for when you burn your mouth. Having said that, I accompany my foodstuffs with lemonade. I don't go for the different flavors they offer (lime, cherry, frozen) because I think the original is perfect. It ain't broke, don't fix it...\n\nAs mentioned before, they make the food to order. That means your order could take about two minutes, so don't be upset. It's worth it. Also, just so you know, this place is not a budget eatery like Taco Bell. If you wanna eat a ton for $5, this place isn't your best bet. I spent $18 today on two combo meals plus a cheese. Totally worth it, though. \n\nThis particular location has a more expansive menu featuring chicken and other stuff.
