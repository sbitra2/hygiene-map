Also in the pita: hummus, cucumber/tomato salad, a couple pickles, homemade potato chips and some tahini.\n\nHummus, from what I could taste, was pretty decent, but nothing special. The thing was a mess and fell apart as I got to the bottom! Obviously, not a complaint from me, because this thing was packed to the brim. The falafel balls themselves, were delicious. The potato chip at the bottom wasn't really crispy--it had become soggy by then. In Israel, cuts of potato are either thick or they're french fries. Salad was pretty basic, but good.\n\nSauces: chili garlic, tahini, yogurt dill. Still no green sauce!

Chips are fine on the side, but if it's not thick in the pita, then you don't get any of the flavor--and it loses authenticity.\n\n2) Laffa. Seriously--offer it! More durable than pita and people will pay more. I know I would.\n\n3) Green zhug! It's easy to make, it's spicy, and it's delicious. \n\n4) They should really offer sabih--the traditional Israeli/Middle Eastern eggplant-in-a-pita dish. I'd buy it.\n\nI'm rambling. Overall? Good.

Unfortunately, they can't make a sandwich worth a damn.  There is no balance to how the ingredients are arrayed in the sandwich with sauce maybe lightly coating the top or bottom if they are not passing it off in a side container.  Sometimes the chicken is cut up into manageable pieces, others you are left to rip the unwieldy pieces up yourself.  With my last visit the pita itself fell apart when I took it out of its box spraying toppings all over my floor.\n\nIf you want a good pita sandwich I recommend a place called New Amsterdam in Omaha, which is cheaper, better and gives you more food.

Legend has it that the Jamburrrito is  jambalaya wrapped in a tortilla.

Just like Indiana Jones looking for the lost arch, we journeyed downtown to Food Truck Fridays on a quest for the Jamburrito.\n\nWe discovered the Jamburrito three Fridays ago, and have returned often.The truck serves up food that is fresh, addictive, top quality, reasonably priced, and packed with a lot of punch.

Oh my gosh!! Heaven in our mouths. One of the things I am particular about are tortillas, and the tortillas Chef Brown uses are spot on. While eating the Jamburrito I felt like I had one foot in New Orleans, and the other in Texas. \n\nBELGIAN WAFFLES AND BUFFALO WINGS\nThis order includes one waffle, three buffalo wings, and some hushpuppies with dipping sauce. Best waffle and wings ever!!!! The waffle is crisp and is dusted with bacon and powdered sugar that can be dipped in syrup. Yummy!!!! The wings don't look like your typical wing. They look like mini lamb chops with a little bone sticking out. The wings are meaty, juicy, and have a crispy skin. The wings are placed in a rubb and sauce. Amazing!!! Oh my gosh!!!!

(I've never had IL's products, but the food truck's offerings looked and sounded great, and the reviews have been pretty positive from a few Yelp friends that I know and trust.)  For some reason, I was under the impression there would be authentic Hawaiian sweets on board, perhaps shave ice (nope) or malasadas (fryers were being repaired), so it was a disappointment not to find any.  However, the food that we had were delicious, if not almost worth the pain I had to suffer soon after consumption!  We quickly found theTasting Room via smartphone's Navigation, saw Island Loco's food truck parked in front, and parked at a nearby space (there are many).  After ordering our food, we went into the Tasting Room (food would be brought to us), which was just a room with tables and a bar counter that faced a window that looked into the brewery's warehouse.  FYI, tours of said warehouse ISN'T available at this location.  While FP food isn't available, the manager was able to provide us paper plates and extra napkins to use, since the food truck only supplies the to-go containers in which the foods are placed and sealed plastic utensils, salt and pepper packets, and single napkin.\n\nBetween three adults and two children, we all were very satisfied with the three entrees ordered:\n\nKalbi short ribs platter, $11-- short ribs marinated in traditional Kalbi sauce, two scoops of hot rice, and choice of side (Hawaiian mac 'n cheese).\n\nFusion Sliders, three for $12 (or two for $9), choice of side and any combo of Kalua pork with lomi, Kalua pork with Asian slaw, and Chicken teriyaki with Asian slaw.  I chose one of each, plus more Hawaiian mac 'n cheese. \n\nHawaiian burger with rice, fried egg (any style), and mac 'n cheese, with choice of brown gravy or another topping, which I've forgotten- sorry!\n\nEveryone loved the Kalbi ribs!  So much so, Mom asked me to order another one to-go.  I found the meat to be too fatty, so I just trimmed the non-chewable gristle and put them aside.  The flavor is exactly like Filipino pork BBQ (on a stick), so Filipino Yelpers will know exactly how these taste!  :)  The Hawaiian mac 'n cheese was light, yet flavorful, and the noodles were tender, but not mushy!  I enjoyed this side very much, although I did notice too late that the dressing had very skinny and short ribbons of carrots (allergy), so it's one of those \"enjoy now, and pay later!\" deals for me.  :(  Mom said the rice was excellent--  she asked me to try it, but then remembered that I had an allergy.  She said it was a pity, since the texture was very good!\n\nI asked Mom to see if the slider I was looking at was chicken (I try to avoid corn and anything that eats corn as much as possible), and she said it was pork, so after asking her again if it was chicken teriyaki, she said, \"no, it's pork,\" I tried it.  Loved the texture, but it was definitely chicken.  I knew the slider next to this one was Kalua pork since I could spot it beneath the Asian slaw, but the other one had chunky lomi (Hawaiian-style pico de gallo) and I couldn't see what was underneath it.  (Obviously, I couldn't recall which slider came with the lomi topping, or I would not have to ask Mom to identify the meats...)  I can't recall if sister enjoyed the pork with lomi, but I think she finished the meat portion.  Everyone enjoyed the bites pork and the chicken we all passed around.  My only complaint was that the buns felt like pieces of paper on my tongue at times.  Y'know, as in when you sometimes take a bite of food wrapped in tissue and you get a chunk of paper stuck to the food?  So there I was, picking off what felt like paper on the tip of my tongue, and it's actually a piece of the bun- weird!  Otherwise, the buns had a mildly-sweet flavor to them and were tender.  They complemented the fillings well.  (However, I would wait until they chose another bun variety before ordering \"slider\" style again, because that paper texture was very annoying.)\n\nNiece had the fried egg and brown gravy-topped burger patty over rice and choice side of Hawaiian mac 'n cheese to herself, and while she liked it, she preferred the Kalbi short ribs much more.  This entree was basically a Loco Moco, but I think it was named so, because you could also choose Japanese curry topping.\n\nBring cash if you don't want to be charged a card fee.

It was relatively well balanced, with the chili just slightly edging the the other flavors to the background, to he point that I could just barely make out the cilantro sour cream.

To me, the only thing that means is that I will never be able to find it again because it's going to drive off somewhere else obscure and that's the end of things.  I know there is a lot of hype right now with food trucks and how cool they are and how they're trendy and they're better than traditional food establishments because they are run by independent people trying to make a living and owning land is a sin or whatever LOOK BUDDY I'm just here to put the food in my mouth, so that's all I'm judging this based on, ok?\n\nSo I walked up to the food truck and took the food and tasted it.  I got their signature dumplings, and Imperial Chicken (which the guy then proceeded to call 'Street Treats' which simultaneously made it much more appealing, and much less appealing).  The dumplings were pretty good, especially considering that it's hard to find good dumplings these days and most people's are just those frozen packaged ones that they then reheat.  I'm talking about lots of meat, tender dough, and seasoning that sticks with you for like, the next 12 hours whether you like it or not.  The Street Treats weren't as great.  Basically it was chicken with seasoning and a little bit of marinade that left a bit of delicious oily-style juice in the bottom of the tray.  Not that they were bad, but I am a man who likes to eat pieces of the chicken that I can identify, like the wing or the thigh or the breast or the face.  It wasn't immediately apparent to me that the chicken was strips of thighs, resulting in some inconsistency from bite to bite.\n\nThe service was good, the people were friendly, and the prices were decent.  I'm giving it three stars (A-Ok!), because it FELT like a 4-star experience, but only because it was novel and fleeting.  If it were a restaurant that I could just walk back to for lunch today, would I?  Eh, maybe.  Maybe not.\n\nSo I guess what I'm saying is if you happen to see this food truck (which is probably why you're looking at the reviews), give it a shot and try the dumplings.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Got the dumplings at a food truck festival.

The truck was very clean and the prices seemed a bit high especially for launching day but I was eager to try it. I noticed that this food truck seemed to have some tyoe of rewards system setup where you scan a QR code i imagine to get a discount I didnt get much information on it of how to sign up the sign was just out there. The truck was very well fitted i saw that they had an entire POS system setup with a clear modem and all. The ipad had a square on it that allowed them to take credit cards and it also wirelessly printed the reciepts to a printer that was seup on the side, pretty trick for a food truck. I wanted to try the asian wrap but they were already sold out so we settled for da lobsta ballz and da pho-licious \"Q\". Im not sure what it was but i felt like they lobsta ballz lacked something something to give them a kick or make the lobsta stand out. Da Pho-licious Q was really good however i found the pieces of meat to be a bit too big for a sandwhich that i truly wanted to share. \n\nI decided to re-try the food truck on saturday 4/27. I wanted to try the asian wrap again but again they were out of it. So this time we had da tofu nachos da meatballz and vegtable wa da pho.

It was closer to walk to the food truck than my car. I had both Rollin Smoke BBQ and Wa Da Pho bookmarked for a while and wanted to try both equally as bad as the other. Talk about a food c-block, f-block.  Well since Wa Da Pho usually isn't out there, a regular food truck and occasionally a good food truck is parked there, I had to go for some. For lunch they have a \"da pho box lunch special\".  Choosing 2 of 5 items and a drink or a dessert and chips for about $9. I went off of the pictures on their food truck since everything looked good, didn't read the food descriptions usually the best way for me to do things. \n\nThe first item I chose was the \"da lobsta ballz\" http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wa-da-pho-las-vegas?select=ggcqbQoGku7B-hmsjahGWg#ggcqbQoGku7B-hmsjahGWg I enjoyed most of it.  The outsides tasted very delicious. The insides however was meh, it tasted exactly like imitation lobster which is what the menu exactly said after I read it, lightly fried imitation lobster balls served with 'da' sauce spiced with their special blend of seasonings. I did no care for the insides because it was mushy like when you use too much water when you cook a pot of rice and try to salvage it. I know some people who like this kind of mushiness so maybe it suppose to be like this, which is fine.  \n\nThe second item was the \"pho-licious 'Q' slider\" http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wa-da-pho-las-vegas?select=ggcqbQoGku7B-hmsjahGWg#FPBIQcO1L4JkJRqleDeUKg it tasted like eating a pho in a slider with more. It was a pretzel slider bun with BBQ pho brisket, papaya slaw, cabbage, cilantro and their 'wa' sauce. It was good again but I didn't really enjoy the pho meat part maybe because I always dump sriracha and hoisin into my pho. I'd ask for more sauce next time or even some of that 'da' sauce from da lobsta ballz. The chips and cinna-bao dessert were enjoyable.\n\nI sampled some of the \"pho-licious 'Q' nachos and they were very good, nice sized but a little small for the price.  It was lightly fried wonton chips with pho 'Q' brisket (wow they actually call it that haha), cilantro, green onion, melted big eye swiss cheese topped off with a splash of 'da' sauce.

I also wanted to try one of their smoothies out. I went with the Coco Coca. The description mentioned that it was like a drinkable Almond Joy and I was sold right there. The total came to $13, not too shabby considering the portions. I didn't even touch my salad because the smoothie was so fulling, definitely a meal in itself. Towards the end of the work day I was getting hungry and decided to try some of the salad. I was asked if I wanted a balsamic or raspberry vinaigrette to go with the salad. I told the guy whatever tastes better and he told me that would be the raspberry vinaigrette. The salad was delicious. The kale was chopped up so finely that it really didn't have a taste so if you're not a huge fan of kale you might still like the salad. The portion was huge, it was good for 2 meals. \n\nI try to eat healthy and like to support local businesses. Mojo Bowl definitely brings those two together for me.

Let's pick apart the product:\n\nThe blend: organic a\u00e7a\u00ed, wild blueberries, banana, peanut butter, and chocolate almond milk. I gotta give props for the organic a\u00e7a\u00ed, and the finished product tastes like it contains powdered a\u00e7a\u00ed, not sorbet. This might be less fun for people who want to pretend they're eating ice cream, but my recommendation is to go get ice cream if that's you. The peanut butter is natural (and delicious) and almond milk is exponentially better than soy milk or apple juice in every regard. Plus, even if there's some added sugar, it's chocolate-y, and I dig that.\n\nThe toppings: Laura's Gourmet Granola, banana, walnuts, dried cranberries, carob chips, and honey. Mojo uses granola made in Tempe, and even though it contains brown sugar and canola oil (tsk tsk) there's only a sprinkling of it on top. Places that overload their bowls with fatty, sugary granola turn the whole thing into a hippie-dippy sundae of regret. The walnuts, carob and fresh banana on top were a perfect combination, and I skipped the honey and dried cranberries because it was sweet enough without them. \n\nThe PB Monkey combines all the best things about a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl into one: it's healthy, filling, nutritious, uses local/wild/other expensive-sounding words/natural/organic ingredients, and leaves you feeling awesome. $8.50 for a bowl of happiness that keeps me satisfied through lunch time? A\u00e7a\u00ed, I say yeeee.\n\nP.S. - Good people of Mojo, might I suggest using a larger bowl?

In a city full of street side taco trucks, you'd never think that one would be so tremendous, but there is a reason La Frontera's truck is in the same place every day of the year. It's un-flipping-believably good. \n\nUpon first inspection, La Frontera is a mangled parking lot full of haphazardly parked cars, a few bums walking by every now and then, and a lot of neighborhood folks. The unassuming \"restaurant\" is made up of folding tables and chairs, a blue tarp as a sunscreen, and a truck full of awesomeness. The menu has all the Sonoran Mexican favorites like tacos, tortas, burritos, quesadillas, and chicharonnes. One will order at the counter using as much broken Spanish as possible, while the employee uses as much broken English as possible. Eventually you will find a medium, and you'll complete your order of amazing. When your number is called in Spanish, you'll get your order along with the typical limes, radishes, cucumbers, and salsas. Upon request, they have grilled jalapenos available at no charge. \n\nThe food here is truly fantastic. The tortillas they use are fresh, homemade, gooey flour tortillas. Their meat is grilled to perfection and marinated exquisitely, which is something you very rarely find in a Mexican street food shop. My pick is the Burrito de Carne Asada, a large flour tortilla teeming with hot grilled beef, beans, salsa rojo, onions, and a bit of cilantro. If you're a taco lover, you'll love the barbacoa beef tacos, a Mexican style BBQ meat with an almost briny, indescribible taste. Wash your meal down with one of their many bottled Mexican sodas, and consider yourself lucky that you got to try one of the finest examples of Mexican street food in the state. I'm so spoiled now and hold just about every burrito in town to this standard... which has led to many disappointments.\n\nBe forewarned that La Frontera is cash only, and basic knowledge of Spanish is recommended, though not necessary. Just remember these phrases and you'll be good \"Burrito de carne asada, con todo\" \"para llevar\" \"es todo\" and remember your number.

Tacos, Burritos, Tacos, etc. with your choice of the normal meats (Asada, Pork Verde, Chorizo, etc. The staff primarily speak Spanish, but  it wasnt an issue to order, Although they did call my number in Spanish, so I could see that getting confusing if you don't know Spanish)\n\nThe food was FANTASTIC. Best Carne Aasda and Chorizo I have had in a long time. Fresh toritllas, great tasting meat, good fillings, a good size, and cheap.

From what I can tell, La Frontera is one of the only places you can get a Sonoran hot dog during the day. Most of them are parked later in the day, ready for bar goers. The funny thing was is that there were actually two trucks on site, and only one of them served the dogs so I ended up at both. \n\nChicago has its celery salt and pickles, and New York has its sauerkraut and mustard, but in Phoenix, they've got Sonoran dogs. Hot dogs are never my go to food but this combination is BOMB. The Sonoran-style hot dog, found also in Tucson and in neighboring Sonora, Mexico, is a hot dog wrapped in mesquite-smoked bacon then cooked on a grill then topped with beans, grilled onions, fresh onions, tomatoes, mayonnaise, cream sauce, mustard and Jalapeno salsa or sauce and served on bread and often with a side fresh-roasted chili. It originated in Hermosillo, the capital of Sonora.\n\nI also ordered a cow head (brain) and cow tongue taco. I'd had cow tongue as a youngster so I wasn't too surprised but the meat of both was mushier than I'd like. I'm also not a huge fan of the corn tortillas but the cilantro and cucumbers were refreshing.\n\nI felt a little out of place here.  Everyone else was Mexican and non-English speaking but we managed.

Eight dollars for a biscuit sandwich I thought imagining some Pillsbury Grands Sized Biscuit or a KFC Biscuit.  But I thought what the heck, it is my goal to give every Truck a chance.

It was HUUUGE.  Shortly there after my name was called and I picked up my own piece of history.

The chicken was a moist generous piece of crispy fried chicken breast.  This was then topped with a creamy authentic country gravy, thick smokey well cooked (not to much not too little) bacon and a slice of cheddar cheese.

They had a \"tasting menu\" going (none of the items on the regular menu were available):\n\n1.  Kalbi rib slider\n2.  Beef & cheddar slider\n3.  Mac & cheese slider\n\nUnfortunately, the Mac & cheese had already sold out by the time I got there (around 1pm).  I ended up with two of each the others, at $3/per.  I've posted some cell-phone pics of my order for everybody to check out.\n\nThe Kalbi Rib slider was served on a lightly grilled bun about 2.5-to-3 inches in diameter.  The boneless beef rib had been prepared in a shoyu/garlic/ginger marinade (nice!) and topped with some grilled cabbage which gave some crunchy texture contrast.  The protein was a bit toothsome, but nothing that would turn you off... actually  I remember thinking that the substantial bun was well-paired with the chosen internals.  Overall, I was digging the Kalbi sliders...  I wonder now if a -tiny- bit of mayonaisse could have been added to the bun.  Mayo would have definitely made the flavor profile more reminiscent of the teri-beef burgers you get at local drive-ins in Hawaii. \n\nNow for the Beef & Cheddar slider:  A person who likes fresh colors and contrasting textures might find this slider too one-dimensional.  Before I picked it up, I was expecting it to be a greasy slog, but instead I was pleasantly surprised at how well the buttery croissant had held it's saucy fill.  The beef was something like you'd find in a traditional philly steak, thin-cut, chopped, lean and well-done.  It had been topped with what I'm guessing was the bechamel cheese sauce from the sold-out mac & cheese slider.  The sauce was rich!  After two of these bad boys I was feeling _HEAVY_.  All items at the Slider Truck are made to order, and that's a good thing because any more than the few minutes between pick-up and consumption would turn the Beef & Cheddar slider into a funky, soggy mess.\n\nI'm going to give three stars today, because my order was fresh and flavorful.  I'd like to revisit the Slider Truck when it's serving up it's full menu, plus a couple tasting items.

I spend a lot of time in LA and NYC and go out of way to find my favorite trucks and to check out new ones.\n\nThe slidin' thru truck is decorated very cool, comic-book panel-like.  I tracked it down in a Bank of America parking lot.  There were a few people there, but not many more than the crew I had assembled to meet up at the spot.  I was curious to see if the gourmet truck thing that has taken LA and SF by storm had a chance here.  This city is such a driving town, not many places where there is a high density of locals where a truck would be able to park.\n\nAnyways...  they had a surprisingly big crew scrambling in the kitchen.  The truck was clean and appealing in design.  I couldn't wait!\n\nUnfortunately I had to.  First, they were out of 2 of the 4 or 5 sandwiches they serve.  That was a bummer.  Once I ordered though the bummer got even bummier.  Took like 10-15 minutes to get the food.  There were more cooks back there than customers?  What gives?  My friends got there before me and ordered and were still waiting well after I arrived, parked, perused the menu and ordered.\n\nWell, if the food is killer it's worth it, thought I.  Finally got the grub.  Looked good.  It wasn't bad at all, just not that great.  I'd rather drive through one of the many In-N-Out outposts than wait in an out of the way parking lot for just okay food.  \n\nBun was a little stale.  Meat was seasoned well, but kinda dried out.

I finally had the chance to check them out the other night. I arrived a little early to beat the crowd and I wasn't the only one with that idea. It was funny to see several people waiting in their cars. Who would ever think that a slider truck would cause so many people to wait in an empty lot for its arrival. I wasn't sure what to get so I ended up getting 5 different sliders and an order of sweet potato fries. Here's how I would rank them from best to pretty good:\n\n1. Pep Pep -- I love the sauce. It was like a Thousand Island type of sauce. It added so much depth to the beef, onion and bacon.\n2. Kalbi -- It had a wonderfully sweet taste to it, but the meat could have been a bit more tender.\n3. Barbie -- Love the bbq sauce!\n4. Yaya -- The feta and tzatziki sauce with the patty was a good combo, kinda like a gyro.\n5. Captain's Order -- A little overcooked. Compared to the other sliders this one just didn't have the same wow factor, but still a solid burger.\n\nThe sliders were bigger than I thought they would be. The patties are thick and 2 or 3 are probably enough to fill up most people. Luckily I had my wife and kid to help me finish all five. Then of course we also had the sugar coated sweet potato fries which were delicious. All of that only cost $15. That's one of the best bargains you'll find anywhere in the city. Where else can two adults eat a satisfying meal for $15? And I'm not counting fast food chains because this food is far superior.\n\nI didn't have the chance to try the pulled porkie (they were all out) but I'll definitely track them down again for another round. They not only have the best sliders in town, but burgers that are just as good, if not better than, many of the upscale burger joints around.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "Great food and service, but fall short in other areas.\n\nThe Barbie, Pep Pep, and Pulled Pork are all delicious and for $7 its just a great value. Just enough to fill you up for lunch, but not enough for dinner.  \n\nCombine with the very friendly service that you can only get from a locally owned business, this would get a 5 star right? Nope, there are some issues.\n\nFirst, the cinnamon fries at $3 is pricey for what you get. I was disappointed to see them use frozen Ore-Ida. When your competition In-N-Out is using potato that is cut in the store and your using frozen potatoes, just disappointing. There is just a difference between frozen potatoes and fresh ones. I rather get animal style fries and have some change left even though I'm a big supporter of the locally owned businesses. \n\nAnother issue is that you have no idea what the offering is for a certain day. They might be offering their 6 regular items, they might only have half the menu available, etc. Today when I came, they only had the Barbie, Pep Pep, and Pulled Pork. Lucky for me, I checked Twitter right before I came. Had I  wanted one of the other 3 and didn't check Twitter before, I would have been disappointed. I know everyone and their grandma has a smartphone, but at least be considerate to your non-smartphone customers like Lisa L. A simple sign showing whats available for the day on the truck could easily fix this.\n\nThe biggest issue with this place is the wait time. 25 mins from the time of ordering is just ridiculous. I could see 10 to 15 minutes, but not 25 minutes. There was about 5 people ahead of me, which added another 10 - 15 minutes wait time before I can even order.  So from the time I arrived, till I got my first bite was about 35 minutes. I know this isn't fast food, but really? I don't even think this was considered busy. Imagine how bad it would have been if it was actually busy. I hope you have 1 hour to spare because thats how long you'll need.

Damn good food and a fun atmosphere.  \n\nFor everyone that has spent time in Austin especially during SXSW you know that while you are in town some of the best food comes from the gourmet mobile trucks around town.  Slider Truck is the first thing in Vegas that is similar.  You might be thinking \"Isn't this just a roach coach that gives laborers heart burn\"?  Answer: no!  The big difference is Slider Truck is manned by three 20 somethings that have a simple menu with gourmet ingredients.  \n\nWhen I visited Slider Truck they had a simple menu of 5 different types of burgers (even a vegetarian option).  I picked 3 and unfortunately 2 of them were unavailable because they had run out of a key ingredient (in my case this was Korean beef bar b q and pork).  The food is cooked to order so be prepared to wait. This isn't a bad thing per se as there are tons of people hanging out in the same boat but, all have really good attitudes and most of them are focused on telling their friends via facebook or twitter about what they are doing.  You see Slider Truck isn't just food it's created it's own social and cultural following.  \n\nSeeing as how this is Yelp lets talk about the food.  For 3 sliders and an orange fanta I paid $9.  It was worth it in my opinion without a doubt.   The Captain's Order burger was tasty and the different elements blended well. The Barbie had a unique kick with the caramelized jalapeno which added a fun if not surprising flavor in every bite (I must admit it is a bit spicy so be forewarned). Finally the Pep Pep which tasted more like an average burger with the super sauce and caramelized onion rounding out the flavor.\n\nI gave slider truck 4 stars instead of 5 simply because I got there an hour after they setup in the location and they were already out of the specials.

This ingenious group of 3 guys who graduated from the CIA of Las Vegas decided to open their own business, riding on a popular trend of food trucks serving unique foods that was sparked up in the Los Angeles area.  My past experiences on these trucks were pre-made sandwiches, and tacos al-pastor (one of my favorites).   This truck only focuses on one type of food product...sliders.  Ricardo was one of the fellers that took our orders and told us about the food and their business.  That day the menu was limited to only three selections: the Pep-Pep, the Barbie, and the Pulled Porkie.  The wife and I decided to order all 3 choices and double up on the Pep-Pep.  My eyes could not stop gazing at the 4 sliders piled high with generous amounts of meat topped with light brown toasted puffy buns.   The Pulled Porkie was filled with layers of stewed juicy and tender pulled pork.  For the other burgers, I wanna say about  to 1/3 lb amount of ground meat cooked to about a medium, so the meat was very moist.  The Barbie was a burger that was covered with cheese and bacon , but was overpowered by the bbq sauce.. The Pep-Pep is what I wanted to focus my taste buds on  because it is the classic burger, the most simplest of them all the menu.  If someone can't make that right, then they don't know what they are doing at all.  \nThe verdict: the Pep-Pep was completely amazing.  When I sunk my first bite into this burger, my mouth felt the texture of the soft toasted bun, then the gooey cheese, and crispy thick bacon, and finally the moist burger.  My mouth lit up because I could actually taste how well seasoned the meat was and how the homemade thousand island, salty bacon, pepper-jack cheese, the lettuce, and tomato completed the whole slider, nothing was overpowering.

I've been wanting eggplant lately so that helped that odd craving. \n\nOff menu today was a brisket slider. It had beef brisket with the BBQ sauce that is on my favorite, the Barbie. Sometimes brisket can be chewy, but this was not- a tender bite. Since we took this home I wanted to add some spice. Perfect zing was this Indonesian hot sauce called \"Sambal Badjak\" which is chili with onions/shallots in oil so its spicy and a bit sweet. AM-A-ZINGGG! I think I'll be bringing a bottle in my purse from now on if we eat at the truck.\n\nSo we had the sweet potato fries last week and it was good with the sugar cinnamon sprinkle on it. This time it had a bit of salt with the cinnamon sugar so I think Ric was maybe reading our reviews again and saw Adina's and worked it in. (HI RIC!!)

Maybe some regular fries next to round out and try everything...but I like sweet potato fries so much though that I gotta hope I'm in the mood soon or someone is and I can pinch a few from them.\n\nOther than that- the same old.

Really? Those people must be desperate to be eating food from a truck that just rolls on up and throws food out a window. Don't they see the 7-11 right here? At least with a 7-11 hot dog your expectations are so low it's hard for them not to be met... but I digress. Slider Truck, at first glance, I thought you were a poor excuse for wetting my taste buds. And now I'm here to publically admit how very, very wrong I was. \nI can now proudly say I am not only a Slider Truck stalker, but an addict. Drug of choice? Pulled Porkie slider with a sweet potato after shock. I'm actually not a big fan of burgers in general, so I leave the rest of the sliders to my husband to explore (he's tried them all and he, too, is now an addict).  But the Porkies?  Holy shit. I can't remember a time I tasted pork so flavorful that just a light drizzle of BBQ sauce is all that's necessary to make them sing praises in my mouth. (They normally come with some caramelized jalapeno- but I like to keep it simple.) The buns are light, but toasted to perfection and each mouthful is truly scrumptious. And as if that weren't enough to make your stomach growl for an encore--there's the sweet potato fries. To date, the best sweet potato fries I have EVER tasted. Crisp, light, sweet with a dusting of cinnamon and sugar (although, I know Ric--the slider truck guy--is more than happy to dust with salt if you so prefer).  You know you have a good thing when I'd rather find the Slider Truck for date night than hit up some restaurant...and the fries--great to stuff in your purse for the movie-shhh!

The slider truck, although casually camouflaged with a comic theme and serving nothing but sliders, creates great eats that are inspiring for those who love to eat and for those who want to cook.  With the food comes the people, a plethora of individuals that somehow meld together into a friendly mass of hungry fans.  Despite the wait time for excellent sliders the people converse as if they know each other, making the wait seem like a few minutes rather than a bit longer.  I don't mind waiting in line with the cult followers because they are a mixture of artists, parents, students, geeks, photographers, and more.  While waiting in line for the slider truck you get an intelligent conversation in with great people. I love it.\n\nWith the crowd comes the need to feed, and the slider truck delivers wonderful morsels of juicy burger love.  They changed me, turning me into a fan of things I do not normally eat, and that is a feat in itself.  The menu is simple and there are days when they have secret menu items available as well, items that their regulars will wait an hour in line for just to get a taste.  Today it was the french dipper, a roast beef slider with melted cheese, onions and mushroom with a side of au jus.  I tried one and it was to die for--tender, juicy, packed from top to bottom bun and seasoned so well that I wish I ordered four more.  I will definitely dream of that french dipper till the next time it's on the secret menu.  When it comes to turning me, the pulled pork sandwich--one that I refuse to eat ever--became an instant favorite of mine from the slider truck.  It's perfectly cooked and the barbecue sauce is spicy, sweet, and oh so smooth.  That pulled pork is juicy and tender, well seasoned and the sandwich, although slider size, is packed full of it.  The other thing that I hate to eat are jalapenos, but they make a jalapeno jelly that I cannot get enough of on their Captain slider.  I could eat fifty of those burgers with the jalapeno jelly on it.  \n\nWith the mind changing food comes great service.  The owner handles the truck personally, along with three to four of his trusted friends that basically line cook to keep the food coming out fast.  They are all friendly, always smiling and they take extra care to pack everything nicely and with everything you need.  A great touch is the candy that you get with every order, because candy can make anyone smile even on a bad day.\n\nThese sliders are like no other.  They are amazingly filling, great tasting, with fresh ingredients and cooked to perfection.  The texture of the patties are perfect, and their sweet rolls that they split into a bun are yummy.  I love the slider truck with all my heart, and they inspired me to try something different every once in awhile.  if you think that this food truck is like others, serving plain food fast and greasy, you have it all wrong.  They serve unique, what I consider gourmet style sliders on the fly. With great prices and service, and the fun crowd and fun times trying to find the truck daily, this is a stop that I'm willing to drive across town to line up for any day of the week.\n\nLine up soon and get your slider fix today, before the food runs out.  The crowds are a plenty, but the specials may not last till you're ready to show up.  That's the fun in this truck--finding it, lining up, talking to people, and then finally eating your addiction.  Get it hot and fast with a smile.  What more could you ask for?  As for myself, nothing.

Using social networking platforms like Twitter and Facebook he is able to let his customers know where he'll be parking for lunch that day, or if there has been a last minute change to the schedule because he's been booted from his post. His truck has already become the talk of the town and he's only been open since Spring, so plan on a line when you come. His colorful comic strip ride is fun to look at while you wait, but if you try to stay out of the sun when its 100 degrees out, I'd suggest coming after summer. At one point my husband and I had been semi serious about starting our own food truck, but the realization we would be in a confined space with limited AC and a flat top in the middle of summer stopped us dead in our tracks. I give Ric and his crew major points for facing this challenge, so I suppose the least we can do is wait a few minutes for a few of his tasty creations.  \n\nThe day I faced the heat I tried the Pep Pep, the Yaya, and the Pulled Porkie, of which the latter was my favorite. The pork was tender and not shredded to death, and the tangy, spicy barbecue sauce bathed it well. The caramelized jalapeno was a nice touch. The Pep Pep was good but ordinary, something like an In-n-Out Burger with a special sauce moving more in the direction of tartar than Russian. Ric also adds crispy bacon to his. The Yaya, a Greek inspired slider with feta, red onion, tomato, and taziki felt healthier than it was on account of the sharpness from the white wine vinaigrette dressing the lettuce. The flavors are great but perhaps lamb for the meat instead of angus would have been better. I can understand the constraints on using more expensive proteins, however, because his sliders are very affordable. You can get one for $3, two for $5, or three for $7. I would be willing to try any of his other sliders, but next time will pass on the limp sweet potato fries, $3. They're tossed with cinnamon and sugar, which I believe would make for a better seasoning if the sugar were replaced with salt. The sweet potatoes offer all the sugar you need, and if that's still not enough then you can munch on the whimsical fun pack of skittles Ric puts alongside your sliders.\n\nIt seems the young people starting unique food businesses in Vegas are favoring burgers. I'd much rather have these businesses than not, but it would be great if someone could come out with something a little different.

The sweet potato fries are my favorite, while they probably aren't as healthy as they sound, I still try to convince myself that they're healthier than regular fries (denial at it's finest).\n\nI have to say that the food isn't what makes me a recurring customer, it is definitely the whole \"food truck\" experience.

If you own a business, slider tuck is a great place to network believe it or not. I also take my dog almost every time, it's hard to find places to eat out that are \"dog friendly\".

Thankfully this time I didn't have to do anything untoward, just pay money and the food came.\n\nSo me and my favorite part time wench went to a park in Henderson to try this local phenomenon.  I got into line. The line barely moved. I waited. The line barely moved. I waited 30 minutes and I was not much closer. Rex became angry. Rex became incensed. Rex cried out to the skies. Rex cried.  After an hour, two beatings, and a slight case of heat stroke I arrived at the window. I had gone to their website and studied their menu. I knew what I wanted. I ordered like a pro. The kid who took my order smiled brightly and called me his hero. I blushed. Me and my sometimes intimate partner I only have to pay scale moved over to wait some more.  We ordered 1 Barbie, 2 Pep Pep and 3 Pulled Porkies. We added drinks and the sweet potato fries.  We waited some more. It took time. Rex hates waiting and this has tried my patience and my left hook to the point of exhaustion.  Finally the food came. We celebrated. We danced. She cried out of her non-glass eye.  It was a beautiful day, only about 200 degrees outside. We sat under a tree. The food smelled great.  \n\nI ate the Barbie and the BBQ sauce was great and the caramelized jalapeno balanced the sweetness.  The Pep Pep was like an attempt at a gourmet Big Mac. The sauce was very familiar and very tasty. Tangy and sweet. It was good. Then the pulled pork. Tender pork, bbq sauce and a little heat from the jalapeno. I ate one of the sweet potato fries and then put about 75% of the container in my mouth at one time.  The verdict...decidedly mixed.  I admire these kids and their attempts to recreate the food trucks of other cities...but it needs to be more than just clever and right now this is just clever. The star of the show was the pulled pork, and why...it was the  only thing that wasn't overcooked. It wasn't sauced enough and it needed a little more flavor in the pork when it was cooking, but overall it was very good. The bun has a bit of grease on it and that made it very buttery. That was nice.  The burgers had the potential to be amazing, but they just weren't. They were so far overcooked that the Barbie I had was like a hockey puck. The Pep Pep was very good but again over cooked and under sauced. I loved the fries. They were well done and relatively inventive. Salt, sugar and spice. Excellent. Another surprise flavor could have really stepped it up a notch, but I am not going to nitpick. \nI want to like these guys, I want to support them. But when I spend almost 30 bucks on dinner I better get more than some really over cooked meat.  The portions were \"slider\" size but the prices were gourmet (3 for 7 bucks), and the execution was decidedly NOT gourmet. \n\nI think the worse thing I can say is that given the wait, the overcooked meat and the lack of some basic fundamentals with the food I can't say I would come back. If I didn't have to wait an hour I would eat there again, but right now the town is obsessed with novelty food that lacks sophistication...why should I spoil that for them.

It sounded really good plus Mercedes was talking about how excited that the truck was visiting their building vicinity (almost like a child on Christmas morning). I saw this truck at First Friday the last two months, but wasn't sure it was the same one (it was). My husband's uncle also said that they have really good sliders (also said that if you're a newbie, they rock the truck). So, it was a group of five of us. Everyone got sliders but I (not my husband) only had the sweet potato fries. Before you ask, \"Why not?\"- my husband is on a weight maintenance plan (he lost 110 pounds and has kept it off for 3 + years- it was not a cheat day for him- my husband told me to remind me to make that FF a cheat day for him, because he really wanted to try the sliders). I practice moderation. \n\nAnyway, the sweet potato fries were in a paper bag, a good amount/size (enough for two people to share), sprinkled with cinnamon- mmm, yummy. I love sweet potato fries- anytime that's one of the options on the menu, I get them. They were slightly crispy but not mushy (I hate that- if you get the frozen kind to prepare at home, it's tricky getting them to crisp, anyway, I digress.) The cinnamon was unexpected but gave it a nice flavor boost. I didn't think that it needed dipping sauce like ketchup or ranch. I didn't finish them- took the rest home. \n\nOur friends (two first-timers) liked the sliders- good size, fluffy buns- looked like hawaiian rolls my husband commented, and reasonably priced- $7 for three sliders (the other options around were rather pricey, for example $10 for BBQ). A good sign is that they were all kinda quiet, while eating- kinda like that Carl Jr's commercial \"Don't bother me- I'm eating.\" There are a few variations- about four or five options on the sliders. Yup, I really want to try 'em for myself, the next time we're at FF, assuming that they'll be there (here's hoping). From the looks of the long line, it was a good sign that this was a solid reputable place to get food.

The Captain's Order is unique with the arugula, bacon, and balsamic reduction. The balsamic reduction adds so much to the flavors of the burger.\n\nThe burgers themselves are cooked to perfection. So often, sliders are over-cooked, but not these. These sliders have just the right amount of thickness and juiciness.\n\nAnd I have to give major props for not only the concept of a slider truck, but also for the fact that you can order just 1 slider or 5 sliders that are each different.

Not only that, we were insulted by the sheer greediness of some people.\n\nIt was happy hour; $1 everything. There was a big crowd but everyone was being pleasant, politely waiting their turn to gobble some slider goodness.

I've been there three times, I've tried everything, its time.  I've only visited them when they are at the MLK Costco during lunch so your experience may differ.\n\nFirst off, the crew is amazing!  It takes some special skills to make you happy after you've been standing in line for 30 minutes in the hot blazing sun, in an asphalt parking lot no less, waiting for a slider.  A fist bump, smile, and upbeat attitude when you get to the window... how can you be mad about being sunburned?\n\nHowever, I can't give this truck 5 stars because I don't like a lot of their food.  My own personal taste preference perhaps.  The barby and the pep pep pretty good.  The pulled porky is amazing.  But the rest of the sliders are kind of meh.  I love feta cheese and I really wanted to love the yaya and the captain's order, but I don't think the feta cheese is strong enough.  I don't taste any tzatiki on the yaya.  It's just not the flavor fest it should be.\n\nAnd I'm not a big fan of the fries.  It's odd, because I'm usually crazy for all things fried... especially potatoes.  But they put sugar on the sweet potato fries, which I don't like, and I think it passes onto the regular fries somehow, because those taste sweet, too.  I need 'em savory.  \n\nPrior visits were during the summer, at noon, and it was absolutely miserable until I got to the window.  The wait was soooo long and uncomfortable.  There were actually a few aborted attempts in Summerlin when I saw how long the line was. But I won't knock off stars, like other reviewers have, just because a business is successful.  They handle the crowds amazingly well with a good attitude and giving people notice via Twitter and verbally when they are about to run out of food.\n\nToday I visited close to 11am, which I highly recommend if possible.  No line, quick service, in and out with no fuss.  And you can get one mystery slider per person before they run out.  Today, it was teriyaki... just basically the barby with teriyaki instead of bbq sauce.  Nothing special but just as good as the barby.  I'm hoping that the mystery sliders will be more creative in the future.\n\nThey have a new truck, which is much higher off the ground like Fukuburger is.  They are still working out the kinks with \"Bertha.\"  There were no fries today because they were coming out soggy.  Since I don't like the fries, no biggie.  But there was one customer that I thought was going to have a heart attack!  He was traumatized!\n\nAlso, they now have a Yelp check-in offer.  Check-in three times and you get two free sliders.  People are totally gonna cheat with this, I know.  But whatever... I'm gonna do it legit.  The check-in function does work at Costco as they have the entire 89109 zip code as their location.  But it may not work elsewhere.\n\nThe new truck is up for sale according to their website, so the hope that they would double their efforts with two trucks is not to be.  But there still is the rumor that they will open a brick and mortar location.  Maybe that will take some of the demand and long lines.\n\nIf it wasn't for the upbeat and fun attitude of these guys, I'd have to give them three stars.

The customer service is awesome. They guys are super nice and will most definitely put a smile on your face several times over.\n\nNow, to the food. The sliders are made to order, so yes you have to wait to order and you have to wait for them to cook. It's usually a much shorter wait than the waiting to order line.\n\nMy favorites are the Barby, the Pulled Porkie, and the Caprese. The former, is Slider Trucks take on a BBQ Bacon burger. The guys add a piece of crispy bacon, crispy onions (think green bean casserole onions), and carmelized jalape\u00f1os. The BBQ sauce is sweet and tangy. It's just the right amount of messy. I crave this mini burg more than any other mini burgs. All hail the BARBY! The Pulled Porkie is the best pulled pork sandwich on the planet. I am pretty sure it;s just tender pulled pork, caramelized jalape\u00f1os, and  BBQ sauce (different than what is on the Barby). Just try it. I guarantee it will melt in your mouth. Lastly, for a lighter option (not in calories), but for a more simple, fresh taste I opted for the Caprese. Tender grilled eggplant, fresh mozzarella, roma tomato, basil (my most favorite herb) and balsamic. It's a mighty vegetarian option and it has a delicate taste. This slider had pizazz. \n\nNow, let's talk about a real American delicacy, the French fried potato. Slider Truck gives you two options, traditional and sweet potato. The traditional are great. Crispy and evenly seasoned. I live for, yes, live for the sweet potato fries. They serve them up with cinnamon and sugar, you can ask to have them salted (as I have seen many Yelpers complain about). They season their fries once the fries are placed in their carryout bags. Go for the sweet potato fries, I promise you won't be disappointed.\n\nDrink options are limited, but excellent. There is Mexican Coca-Cola (made with REAL sugar verses high fructose corn syrup), Orange Fanta (also with REAL sugar), and Smart Water.\n\nSome additional things that I love about the Slider Truck are:\n1. How awesome the guys make you feel.\n2. They include moist towelettes in all orders.\n3. Fun-sized candy with your order. (FREE DESSERT)\n4. If you leave them a big tip, they TIP the TRUCK!

If you follow them on Twitter (@slidertruck) or sign up for their text alerts (via their website slidinthru.com), they have HAPPY HOUR where everything on the menu is $1. (On these days get there ASAP because they sell out  FAST!)\n7. It's Winter now and they have been giving out  FREE hot cocoa out, while you wait. \n\n\nMy only beef is that they don't take credit/debit cards.\n\nI love the Slider Truck, check their weekly schedule and see when they're in your neck of the woods.

They perfectly complement the smoky bacon, cheddar, crispy onions and BBQ sauce that inevitably make you understand why they include a wet-nap with each order.\n\nThe Pep Pep is a more standard bacon cheeseburger, with lettuce, tomato and caramelized onions - \"super sauce\" is the only deviation from tradition. I think super sauce is watered-down ranch dressing. \n\nI definitely prefer the Barby, I think maybe the reason is I'm eating the Pep Pep second - the Barby is clearly the more flavorful burger.

After waiting about 10 minutes in the 100F+ heat, it was finally my turn to place my order with Ric. I remember trying the Captain's Order, Yaya, and Pulled Porkie.  The food was alright to me, felt that the burgers back then was a little dry and could use a little more sauce.  But I wholeheartedly support the entrepreneurial spirit of these Las Vegas culinary students jumping with both feet in on this food truck trend sweeping the country.  Ric was awesome and made every customer feel like VIPs.  And at 3 sliders for $7 (1 slider = $3, 2 sliders = $5) + $2 regular fries or $3 sweet potato fries, it was an inexpensive and unique dining experience.\n\nAnd on Thursday I decided to go again because class let out earlier than expected, plus I have some Groupons that I finally printed and they were at the Cox Communications building off of Rancho @95.  When I arrived there was a decent line, and some people enjoying their sliders on the collapsable chairs they have brought with them (they must be pros at this whole food truck dining thing). It turns out that it was Ric's birthday and he was giving away these mini slider desserts to customers. It looks like a miniature hamburger, and I thought it would be cool to take a picture of it before polishing it off.\n\nSo after waiting for maybe 20-25 minutes, someone other than Ric finally took my order (Captain's Order, Barbie, Pep Pep and their Sweet Potato Fries) and I handed over my Groupon worth $10.  Pretty good deal having paid $5 for the Groupon offer.  He was nice enough, but I wasn't offered the mini hamburger dessert cake. I guess they were starting to ration it, because while I waited for my order to be prepared it was only offered to some of the girls in line.\n\nAnyway, My Captain's Order was flavorful and a lot more moist and juicy this time around.  I also liked the Barbie with the flavorful BBQ sauce. But the YaYa was no good (tiny patty that was gone after 2 bites and leaving more than half the bread).  2 out of 3 ain't bad.  And the Sweet Potato Fries with the contrasting sweet and salty taste was enjoyable as a dessert snack. The mystery slider that I have tried was good (Roast Beef with Cheese, and they are more generous with the roast beef on the slider).\n\nI bought a total of 4 Groupons since my first visit so I can really experience the Slider Truck.  And aside from seeing their loyal followings that would wait for the truck before their scheduled arrival (pretty cool), I have also experienced a few late arrivals (not cool - especially on cold winter evenings), fairly long lines, but they are getting better at fulfilling orders quicker.\n\nOverall, I think the food served is alright.

Because The People's Champ loves to please fans, he will simply go about the pro's and cons about this mobile establishment.\n\nPros:\n- Food = Delicious, Kuge especially is in love with the pulled porkies, and their fries.  \n- Price = Reasonable, as others mentioned they have the 2 for $5, and 3 for $7 slider deals that are essentially the nuts.  But on top of that they occasionally run special deals if you follow them on twitter.\n- Atmosphere = Fun, Every time Kuge is ready to order his food, everyone working at slider truck always brings in a lot of energy and fun, you can't help but give'em window love whenever you order food.\n\nCons:\n- Waiting times.  Now, before all you Slider Truck fanatics get all, \"Kuge, it's part of the dynamic of going to a food truck so of course you should expect to wait\".  Kuge would like to say he understands that aspect, but Kuge also understands that when Slider Truck says they will be at a place at 6pm, and they should not show up 15-20 minutes later, then have 15-30 people vulture around the place because of the delay, and have to wait 30-45 minutes to get food, he's gonna be a little upset.  Even though The Great One's time isn't valuable, he would like to think it is!\n- Inconsistency with what they have available.  There were a couple times where Kuge would want his favorite pulled porkies and fries, only to find out that they don't have either available.  On top of that, Kuge also would go back to his previous con of waiting, nothing is worse than waiting in line for 20-30 minutes only to find out that the food you want is not available.\n\nDespite these cons, Kuge acknowledges that these instances don't happen often and for the most part his experiences are good.

Don't get me wrong, there are some really great food trucks out there that are doing innovative cuisine.  Slidin Thru  however, is simply cooking small burgers with some interesting toppings.  Everything tasted fine and I would have no problem going back, Im just not about to soil myself because I just had a hamburger off a truck.\n\nLike I said, the food was decent.  I had a the 3 slider combo for 7 bucks and opted for their Pulled Pork, the burger with the balsamic reduction and the one with feta cheese and bacon.  The buns are soft but rather un-noteworthy.  The beef was cooked nicely but it lacked a distinct flavor.  The Pulled Pork was actually the best of the bunch with a nice, subtle sauce and the right level of moistness in the meat.  The french fries were beyond average but they also offer sweet potato fries for a buck more....might be worth the upgrade.  \n\nThe guys running the truck are outgoing and helpful although they do one thing that I think is very unbecoming.

Shortly thereafter, I got my food and began to dig in. \n\nAll three burgers were juicy and packed with toppings within a nice bun. My favorite was the Barby.

A sweet potato fry managed to sneak in with my order and I regret not ordering it because it had more flavor and crunch. All the hype that surrounds this truck gave me high expectations, so maybe that's why I felt a bit disappointed. Service was personable and they really try to make you feel included, I think.

(Always ask if there is a special not on the list... you could be pleasantly surprised!)\n\nI have two favorites... one being the Pulled Porky (listed as a specialty slider - limited time?) with jalapenos. Spicy and sweet - one of my all time favorite combinations - with a nice hit (slightly more than a hint?) of spice that gives a nice depth to the flavors. The Barby, another pork BBQ sandwich, is pretty amazing, too. Who doesn't love all of these flavors... with bacon?!\n\nI also love the caprese slider (also listed as a special). The eggplant is a great \"meat\" and the combination tastes fabulous. Really fresh and lighter than I expected, it's a great summer day option. \n\nThe Yaya was a close second to the Pulled Porky/Barby faves... but this Greek gal is a sucker for feta and red onions. The vinaigrette has a great pop to it.\n\nThe Plain Jane is anything but. Maybe not a specialized combination/recipe, it is still done well and very tasty.\n\nThe fries are fries.

On more than one occasion I've ordered a slider that they ran out of supplies for but to make up for it they gave me a coupon for a free slider.

Ranging from the vegatarian eggplant Caprese to the caramlized, bbq sauce, fried onion strip, and bacon covered Barby. My personal favorite being the gyro-esque Yaya with feta cheese, red wine vinaigrette, and tzatziki sauce. They have a slider to suit any palette and they are suprisingly consistant. Everytime I've ordered a slider it tasted just like my previous visit's sliders. I have never witnessed a badly made slider at Slidin' Thru.\nLast time I was there the prices were $3 for one slider, $5 for two, and $7 for three. Its in line with the average food truck price. Not a crazy amount of food for the money but its more than reasonable considering the quality.\nNow, I've tried sliders at a few restaurants and I have to say that sliders from Slidin' Thru are plainly put, better. Maybe it's because restaurants don't put enough focus and effort into their sliders or maybe because Slidin' Thru just makes a mean slider.

The next day it isn't soft and tastes a bit tough. Yeah, if the bread was soft/fresh I'd give more stars.\n\nWhile making a stop at the Slider Truck on my way home one Wednesday evening I did mention to the dude at the ordering window that I'm not feeling the bread. He asked why and I told him that the few times that I've gotten a slider the bread just wasn't soft and didn't taste fresh to me. In his exact words he smiled and said \"NAWWWW\" \nHe did yell to the dudes making our sliders to make sure the bread is soft.

Being that these are sliders (i.e. not very large or filling), we tried a couple each. Now, I probably would've gone with more than that, but the prices here are bug-nutty bonkers. $3.00 average for one slider. It is more cost effective to eat at an actual restaurant, like Red Robin, which simply isn't reasonable for a drive thru. Now let me describe these things to you.\n\nThe bun is a fitting size for a decent slider, but this becomes a problem when the ingredients inside don't even reach the edge. What comprises any one of these things are tasty, quality ingredients, but good luck experiencing them under all that bread. You can expect a golf ball sized gob of meat that isn't flattened much, with toppings sprinkled or stacked in a way that makes it more tall than wide. Often times, especially in the use of something like feta cheese, it all falls out the second it's moved or bumped. Yes, they are nice, but 20-30% more between the bread would've made a world of difference, and might actually let you taste something.\n\nSo about a dollar a bite for something overpowered by the most plain ingredient. To back these up, we had the plain fries, as having them topped with sauces, cheese, bacon or even marshmallow results in a near doubling of the price. Absolutely nothing special, tasting about as bland as fries can possibly taste. To be nice, they had a pleasant crispiness to them and are quite heavy, so even more carb overload to quiet the protein deficiency the sliders may have left you with.\n\nThe inside aesthetic is comic book heavy, with minimal seating and an absolutely ridiculous number of employees milling around each other like a small mob. I counted 13 in a space designed for about 7. And this place pushes stereotypical hipsterism as hard as it possibly can on everyone that goes near the place. I fully expect there to be boxes of Buddy Holly glasses just sitting around in the back room, because half the employees wear them as part of the uniform. Expect to be treated like some long-standing homie, with ironic undertones that we're all too cool to be in a fast food joint.

I remember going to their truck stop during the summertime by Yogurtland and getting a coupon for a free cup off yogurt after you eat their sliders... Great, great marketing strategy ;) The energy they bring when ordering makes all the difference in the experience of their followers. I didn't even know what to expect coming from having a mentality that \"Food Trucks\" were dirty and the food was considered.. junk. I had an immediate change of heart from my first experience in trying this particular food truck. Fist pumps, the enthusiasm that makes you smile, and of course the sliders and sweet potato fries... I was literally blown the heck away.\n\nNow to the goods... These are my usual:\n\nThe Barby: Love cheddar cheese.. it's melted on top of the thick mini patty with a piece of crisp bacon, tangy bbq sauce. On the bottom layer.. there are some caramelized jalapenos and crispy fried onion strips. The soft fluffy buns with all these elements of deliciousness. makes this my favorite slider...\n\nThe Yaya: Reminds me of some greek food, but in a slider form. I'm not a huge fan of Feta Cheese, but in this combination.. it works. This slider was somewhat... refreshing to bite into. The fresh lettuce, tomato, red onion, tzatziki, and red wine vinaigrette made it like a healthy treat than anything else. Loved it.\n\nThe Captain's Order: Another feta cheese version that I did like...  You can't go wrong with sauteed onion and crisp bacon in a slider.. I call this a Classy One. Included balsamic reduction, roma tomato, and arugula. Flavorful and nice bite from the balsamic reduction. The feta cheese in both sliders really give it a lot of character and color to each bite. Enjoyed this one very much.\n\nSweet Potato Fries: Long thin rectangular shaped fries... Absolutely LOVE them. \n\nOccasionally I'll try something different... I did like the Pulled Pork. The meat was so tender!!! The spice from the bbq sauce and caramelized jalapenos brighten the whole taste and gave this slider a great kick!!! Ha Yaaaah on that! \n\nI did go adventurous one night and ordered their Mystery Slider... which was Da Irish Hash!!!  A WHOLE hash brown, egg, chedda peno, n bacon. As I was eating this slider, half the hash brown fell off and even eating that only was so darn good!! Crisp on the outside, tender in the inside... now that's a great piece of hash! This mystery slider made my night... it was so delicious and hearty. I so needed this from dancing like a maniac at work and let me tell you... I left Very happy!!! \n\nNow for dessert.. I did try their Sweet Potato Smores. They bring it out to you like a baked casserole. Melted marshmallows, chocolate syrup, and topped with crumbled graham crackers. Dig in and you'll find yourself lost in sweet ecstasy. So warm and so good. This really is soothing to the soul. Some think soup.. but if you're sick of soup.. think of this dessert! ;)  \n\nService has always been exceptional here... Nick introduced me to Jarritos. Delicious lime flavor that goes well with sliders and fries.. Thanks Nick!!! My girlfriend took me here for my birthday and she was confused at first on why I chose this spot to have a nice birthday dinner. She goes... you sure?!?! There's some nice places in the hotels you know? I told her.. I know, but you asked and this is where I want to go. So we met up here and she was just pleasantly surprised how good this place was. She told me... now I understand why you wanted to come here :D Damn right girl!!! There were times where the server? would attempt to skateboard with my food in his hands... I thought that was quite cute and amusing... until he dropped a few of my sweet potato fries!!! I was like Oh Noooooo!!! AHhhhhh!!! I almost... almost dived down to the ground to catch it in my mouth, but he ran all those fries over... such tragedy of sweet potato fries in my mouth world.

I'm sure some of these people can take the time to understand, running a food truck vs running a restaurant is two different things.  I understand that they offer certain amount of sliders for a certain price.  But trying to maintain a restaurant, you have to put the price somewhere, to keep the business open.  Maintaining a food truck is probably easier, than maintaining a restaurant.  So I understand where the pricing in the restaurant is a bit more than the food truck pricing.

Either way, I respect Slidin Thru.\n\nOther than pointing out the difference and seeing where they have to make those changes, for them to run the restaurant.

My girlfriend and I attended the food truck festival at the Southpoint.  I have read and heard so many great reviews.  Could not wait to try this place.  In fact, 40% on my reason for coming to this festival was to finally try Slidin' Thru.  First off, the line was really, really long.  I hate waiting in lines.  But, I'll admit its a fairly reliable sign of good food.  After about 15 minutes of waiting in line the person in front of us stated that Slidin' Thru was out of everything but the Plane Jane.  Thanks a lot Slidin' Thru for not telling us sooner.  At this point we were committed, even if I could only try the Plane Jane.  As we got near the ordering booth I noticed a group of girls lingering around the ordering booth.  They were typical high school girls: over concerned with their looks and not particularly friendly.  Perhaps, Slidin' Thru groupies as Slidin' Thru has earned their street credit as a cool place.  Then, it was my turn to order (around 30 minutes of waiting already).  The man was slow to take my order.  I'm sure he was tired because I know they were super busy, but the food festival had been going for only three hours (it was 8 pm and the thing went from 5 pm to 9 pm).  The truck was nicely decorated and hip-hop played on the radio inside.  We ordered two Plane Janes and one Caprese, they were out of everything else.  Then we began our wait for the order to be cooked.  One of the groupies picked up an megaphone and said \"Hey, people of the truck.  We are out of everything but the Plane Jane.\"  Okay, so at least one works for the truck.  They were not all just groupies.  And, why hang out right at the ordering station?  The area was really crowded already.  It did not need 6 or 7 more people lingering.  Especially with their attitude.  Also, why not give the public service announcement every 5 or 10 minutes?  Why wait so long?  People get really pissed off for waiting in line so long just to find out something like that.  Our food finally came out.  Total time, about an hour.  The meat was under cooked.  It was pink in the middle and cold.  the buns were dried out and crusty.  The Caprese fell apart as we tried to eat it.  The food was not special.

I do like the Chicky Boom that is on the menu now and my usual is the caprese or sub eggplant into the yaya.A little note, I noticed they use plain type buns now but way back when it was more like a sweet bun and I prefer the texture of those which I thought gave it more of a \"gourmet\" slider feel as it should. \n\nFries wise, I either go plain or I like the barby superfries when I'm feeling extra junkfoody.

I had to kind of hunt for the ingredients and break it down.  The hot sauce and swiss were almost non existent and the chicken was this tiny little piece of flavorless meat.  The crispy onions were good and a nice touch.  Wouldn't repeat this one or would try it light ranch and more hot sauce?   2/5\n\nCaprese-  Saved this for last....A friend of mine says you can really taste food with your eyes, and she's right!  It was clear this was going to be the best slider as you could see the fresh eggplant and cheese, tomato bulging outside of the bun.  It was like the Buffalo Soldier and the Caprese came from different slider joints.  Very tasty and the most balanced of the 3 I tried.   5/5\n\nFries - Regular fries with the combo were really good and generous portion.  4/5\n\nOverall comments\n1.  Price..all this food was $11, which seemed steep but I was ridiculously full after so I guess it's highish but not ridiculous.  I think people would warm up to the price if the value meals came with 2 sliders and less fries perhaps?  The plain jane was pretty tiny and the ala carte price of $2.5 seems LOL   3/5\n\n2.  The buns....weren't bad, weren't great....but seemed uninspired and seemed to dominate the sliders with the exception of the Caprese.

My first slider was the Pulled Porky. Holy. Crap. This is absolutely the best pulled pork and BBQ Sauce that I've ever had (sorry, Ben's BBQ). The pork was so tender and juicy, and the sauce was perfect. I didn't even remember that it had jalapeno because I didn't taste anything spicy, so don't let it scare you off. It's one of the less expensive options and definitely the yummiest.\n\nNext up: Pep Pep. Pretty good. Flavor profile isn't anything groundbreaking.

They use a numbered ticket system but it's not really too long of a wait...no one complained at our wedding. The company will even do custom orders like adding street tacos or the meal you ate on your first date to your menu! Also, if you are an Eco-friendly bride, don't forget to ask for their green serving containers. Easy to work with, EXCELLENT food! Unbelievably low prices!

We both grab a barby and share regular fries. \n\nThings have changed since the last visit drastically. \n\nThe burger patty was very, very thin. Think of White Castle type patty when these originally started pretty fat when Ric owned it. When I grabbed my burger the basket had a pool of oil. The flavor was okay because of the bbq sauce, but it was mostly bread and greasy onion crisps (which probably caused the pool of oil).\n\nThe fries changed in that the thin crisp breaded shoestring fries are now thicker fries,- think like 5 guys like. They weren't very crisp and were soggy on the bottom since they got crammed in the cu and just steamed themselves. \n\nGirl up at front was much more quiet and not as personable as previous counter folks. \n\n$9 for this 2 slider, fries and drink combo isn't worth it when those sliders are super skimpy. They used to be worth it when they were fat and juicy. Just look at the photos from the beginning vs. now... they recently fused the truck reviews with the reviews for the brick location and you can see the difference. I should've stopped and taken a picture, but I was in a hurry and just jamming something in my mouth in the 5 minutes I had to spare. \n\nThis wasn't the burgers with heart that sold itself.

I tried the Peppep and the Buffalo Soldier sliders.  I really enjoyed them both, but wished there was a bit more meat on each one.  My hubby tried the Porky and the Plain Jane.  I stole a bite of the Porky and almost didn't give the slider back because it was so yummy. I totally couldn't have eaten a 3rd slider, but I didn't want to look like a pig, especially since my hubby only ate 2.  The fries were really good too.  They tasted like they were fresh cut and hot out of the fryer.  YUMMY.  Take a bunch of napkins though.  The sliders were saucy (in a very good way) and did kinda get all over the place.  Double yummy on the saucy sliders!\n\nI do think the prices are a bit high.  For what we got on the sandwiches, I think $0.50 less on each would be a more fair price.  Even with that, I think we will be back regularly.  The prices on fries and drinks were spot on though, in my opinion.\n\nOn a side note, the place was completely empty our entire meal.  Even the drive thru window remained empty and not one car went through while we were there.  We didn't really see the staff either.  It was a little weird, but when we did see them, they were friendly, helpful, and smiling.  I think if they were a little more present and didn't disappear for long periods of time, it would improve the atmosphere of the joint a bit.

There was literally no one in the restaurant. \n\nSo for our food..... I got the Plain Jane, while my husband had the Plain Jane and the Buffalo Soldier. I thought the Plain Jane was a pretty decent little slider, it was juicy and if it only had some minced onions on it, it would have been perfect. While I didn't try it, my husband said his Buffalo Soldier was enjoyable.\n\nThe cheapest sliders started at $3.00 apiece and they went up from there. I think most people would probably want to order a minimum of two sliders. Plus most people would probably order fries and a drink too. So it could get a little pricey. \n\nMaybe it was the weird Twilight Zone ambiance but I like Slidin' Thru as a Food Truck better than an actual sit down restaurant.

It was my first visit and decided on the Captain's Orders and the YaYa. Each slider is $3.50.  However, one is free when you check in through your Yelp app.  Not a bad deal if you ask me.  Both sliders were extremely tasty and full of flavor.  The YaYa was a little rich for me.  It's all good since I went back and forth taking bites out of the YaYa and Captain's Order.

My biggest thought here is where's the beef, Obviously it's a slider so there's a little beef to be had. When I say deconstructed 2 of my burgers to make one bigger burger I can actually taste the meat and it was decent, not great, but decent. I think I would stay away from this restaurant especially if you have to drive far out of your way like I did you get here. Aswell this place also had sweet potato fries which seems to be the norm at most restaurants nowadays. The difference here if they actually put sugar on their fries. If I want to eat sweet potato fries because I am trying to be healthy, I don't need the added sugar.

I've been a loyal fan of them for forever. I also love that they have a brick and mortar store. My only regret is that I don't live closer to them anymore. \nOne of the major things you'll like at slidin thru is the vibe and environment. The music is always nice, and usually something you don't expect to hear at a burger joint. It's spacious and well designed. The aesthetics work well together and it's a very pleasant environment to be in. \nThe sliders are all pretty good. There's a vegetarian one that I've never tried because I'm team carnivore all the way. My favorite are the porky which is a pulled pork and jalape\u00f1o and the buffalo soldier which is a buffalo chicken inspired bit. They also have mystery sliders and random daily sliders that come and go so its always worth a shot to check that. \nThe fries in my personal opinion are meh. I've never had em where I like em there's always been something wrong with them so I never even really eat them anymore. \nAnother great experience is with the workers. They are always super friendly, super nice and give you a fist bump when you get your order. Another random aside is that the hats that the workers wear are awesome. It's a black/red/yellow SnapBack with their logo. It's ridiculously awesome and they sold it at the store for awhile. I've actually bought like 4 of them but because everyone loves it and always steals them from me because they just have to have it. Maybe I should just get a punch card with the hats. After the 4th hat your 5th is free lmao. \nBut overall this is a stellar place. Food is good, vibe is good.  If you ever aren't on the north side you can go to the food truck.

First, never fight a naked man unless you are also naked. Sounds counter-intuitive, Rex understands that, but the degradation of fighting a naked man while clothed is too much for most people to handle.  Second, Xenu is real and when that guy comes back you are all in trouble.  Third, if you work on a movie set never scream \"all the chicks around here look a little pudgy...without clearing out your ex-lax and diet pill collection. That feeding frenzy can last for weeks.  Lastly, Rex rarely...more rare than crumbs on Orson Welles shirt...will a food experience be better the second time when it was disappointing the first time. A second bite of that old apple is usually the apple that leaves pesticide on your lips and a worm that doesn't get you high in your stomach. Gentlemen, and other scumbags, this is doubly true for your experience with the ladies.  First time you are with them it is okay...second time...the always hide the valuables you didn't take and make sure no cash is in the house. Tricky tricky.\n\nRex was disappointed when he went to the Slidin' Thru food truck a few years ago. Long line. Little pay off. The burger was okay, but they were all overcooked.  An overcooked burger is like Rex after too much of his homemade punch (1 part Smith's brand Draino, 2 parts powdered eggs, 3 parts Von's brand Windex, 4 parts water from Lake Mead)...burned past the point of good taste.  Rex is a fiend on punch. A punching fiend.  The burgers on line were tasty because of the unique flavors, but the burger itself was a letdown due to the hour long line. In all fairness they would have been a let down on a 3 minute line.  Creativity is great. It is flair. Flair is great. Rick Flair is great. Flair is what got David Copperfield girls while looking like a wax statue of a man made by a blind person with 4 fingers. 3 flares and a canister of propane got Rex 8 months. Flair can overcome a lot. The problem with flair is that it fades quickly...like drinking ammonia or dating Taylor Swift.  Both come on strong but are no good in bed. (Ammonia releases the bowels...much like TS's music.)  Flair is for gimmick hungry newbies. Slidin Thru felt like gimmicks the first time to Rex and Rex NEVER went back. Until Rex was eventually dragged back...but this time to the Slidin' Thru restaurant and this time by his new woman Martha \"Skin Sack\" Sugarmanington. \n\nSkin Sack told me that these burgers were good. She begged. She implored. She used her feminine wiles. Then she did the only thing that Rex can't resist. She paid.  So Skin Sack and I headed up to what felt like Utah by the time we got there. Could this place be any further out?  Next time why not just make a lean-to out in the desert?  Rex was annoyed. An annoyed Rex is a projectile vomiting Rex.  Not good for Skin Sack's bike...but that girl can peddle. \n\nRex is happy to say that Slidin' Thru was MUCH better than before. The Pulled Porky, obviously named after Skin Sack before the operation, was the very good.   Rex loves pulling on her skin as she peddles me around town. Rex cuddles up in it on a cool night.  Rex pulls some skin over his head as a skin shade.  To me the best two burgers came down to the old standby...the Pep Pep. Cooked well, made with care, and packed with flavor...but...I have to give the nod to the Chicky Boom.  The sriracha is the star of this sandwich.  Great addition burst of flavor, some heat, a little needed complexity. Excellent sandwich. The regular fries were good, but the sweet potato fries we excellent. Crunchy, soft on the inside. Really a nice sweet component to cut through the richness of the burgers.\n\nRex has complaints.  The Captain's Order is bordering on vile. The flavors don't work. They went for a Greek thing, but it is like watching Greco-Roman Wrestling...odd, off putting and a waste of time.  The Caprese is such a great concept...but it was terribly under seasoned and the sauce reduction too sweet. Also of all our burgers, and we ordered a lot...we did get some that were borderline overcooked. None were as terrible as the truck, but still...this place isn't cheap. Rex isn't going to the ends of the earth to get stuff that is hit and miss. Skin Sack worked hard to get us there...she deserves better than standing outside while Rex spends her money and she is forced to watch Rex eat food that isn't subject to better quality control.\n\nRex has one big problem and it goes back to the truck issue...Slidin' Thru is popular. They do well. They have a fan base.  That is all great. Rex has a feeling what they don't have is exacting standards for their food. They love tattoos and having fun, working hard and creating interesting flavors...but they don't love holding themselves to a higher standard each and every time they cook. They push burgers.

Firstly, it used to be called Karinas 2 and it is now Sinaloa. So if you're looking for that, then what you're looking for is Sinaloa. Way before, they used to be by Oakey by Luv- Its then moved to this side of town. .Now it WAS on the corner of Vegas Dr and Decatur Blvd.but it has since moved... You will see a cart at that gas station and that's some new vendor. They are now at Billy Macs Auto lot on Decatur and Lake Mead. Now my goal for next time is to get their hours, but for now the best bet is to go later in the day. Oh yeah, they take cash AND card which is unusual for a taco cart. \n\nIt is pretty basic what they offer. Meats : carne asada, al pastor/adobada, chorizo, lengua, cabeza. You can get it as tacos, tortas, burritos, quesadillas or mulitas. They have some sodas and horchata. \n\nSo the positives - \n\nHANDMADE TORTILLAS. So when corn tortillas are fresh they tend to soft and fluffy of a consistency than mass produced ones, even the better brands. They also make fresh flour tortillas, but I did not try them on this visit, but will one day. I love that they offer fresh tortillas here, which separates them from a lot of taco spots. \n\nWe tried\n\nAdobada - pretty solid. It's not my favorite one in town, but pretty good. \nCabeza - really nice and now sinewy/fatty like some can be which was a plus for the BF. \nLengua - theirs was good. The BF is weird about how some can be a bit gelatinous, but this was meaty and none at all. He just prefers a smaller dice than big cuts like this, but it was tender and delicious to me. \n\nPacked ours to go and it stayed well the 5 minutes to get to my MILs place. They packed up salsas for us, but we hit the salsa bar for some of the extras like the diced up pineapples, pickled carrots and peppers, pickled onions, more limes, etc. \n\nIt was pretty fast and efficiently run and seemed pretty clean inside from what I can see when their side door was open. The meats are solid, the fresh made tortillas are a huge plus. Definitely one of the better taco carts around and I will definitely be back to try more.

You can also order grilled onions and jalapenos for your tacos as well. The lengua was the large tender chunks that I like and the al pastor was tender and flavorful. Both were delicious even after packing them to go and driving the 20 minutes home.  They also have a condiment bar off to the right of the truck with pineapple salsa, cucumbers, beets, lime wedges, green and red salsa, and this guac dressing.  Look for the little plastic baggies to put the goodies in....being a rookie, I started packing sauces in the baggies but later was informed by the workers that the to go orders come with the red chili sauce and guac dressing on the plate.  Expect a little bit of a wait time since the tortillas are made in the truck.  The man handing out the orders was also kind enough to realize we couldn't understand Spanish...so he made it a point to get our number and bring us our order =) \n\nA few side notes, they also take credit cards and a hot dog cart is over on the left if you have a child who won't eat tacos, and you can even pick up a boot leg DVD from the hot dog cart =P.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "I have nooo complaints with this truck!!

The balls themselves had a nice crispy outside and it was soft and gooey on the inside. But it didn't have much flavor.

The sriracha sauce that you can get with it was much needed, and it was very good.\n\nTurkey Slider: Probably my favorite. The bacon confit was delicious and went really well with the turkey patty.

For those with restricted diets (or kids) there were turkey hot dogs, veggie burgers and beef hot links. The pulled pork was simply delectable. It was tender and moist and had the perfect balance of smoke and flavor. The bread tasted fresh from the bakery and the sauces that accompanied the sandwiches were all equally gratifying. The spicy BBQ sauce had some serious kick! The cole slaw was outstanding, mixing chipotle flavor into a traditional southern staple was ingenious especially when added to the sandwich! The peppered corn was so tasty and seasoned people were coming back asking for seconds. They also served 300+ pounds of the sweetest watermelon I've tasted since I left the south. \n\nThe staff were all attentive and genial. The guy who carved all of the watermelon in the 100+ degree heat, did so with a smile on his face, never once complaining. The owner of the business has one of those personalities that belongs on a comedic stage. He socialized, danced and interacted with the employees all while overseeing the food service. I admire the fact that he wasn't afraid to get dirty, always assisting wherever he was needed. They served all 1000 of our employees in a few hours without ever having a line or a long wait.

Lets talk about the SAUCE, which in my opinion was the highlight of the meal. Hubby had the Feinberg which was a sweet apricot sauce with just a hint of spice, and I had the Bobby Q, their signature barbeque sauce. Both were equally outstanding. To compare them would be apples and oranges because one is sweet and spicy and the other is bold and tangy, but both are awesome. \n\nThe macaroni salad was good, but it was just macaroni salad...nothing special. The bread, while ordinary, can double as a vessel for sopping up extra wing sauce as well as the amazing ranch sauce. You're probably thinking, \"eww, ranch on bread.\" But trust me, this is not Hidden Valley. The ranch is so good that you'll want to dip something in it.

The pho was not flavorful enough and needs more depth....the broth was kind of bland and no amount of jalapeno and basil helped and I expected more than that (especially for 8$ when you can get a much larger bowl of pho at Pallets down the street for the same price or a larger bowl anyplace in Seattle for around 4$). The grilled cheese was good. Anyway, I was sort of disappointed....it seems that this place is more gimmick than substance.

On the other hand, I came here for the food, and it did not live up to expectations.  For example, we had the vegetable stir fry.  I am not sure if they were going the healthy route, but to be frank, it was bland.  Of course it was fresh from the pan so it was steaming in my to go box, although every bite was exactly the same.  It had crunch, I tasted the veggies, but that was about it.  No salty flavor from the soy sauce or any spices to add to the mix.  My wife and I were very disappointed.  Although it could have gone up when we tried the Banh Mi...\n\nAnd...another disappointment.  The reason I love Banh Mis are the French baguette crunch, as you bite through the sandwhich it may be a little rough, but the spice and Asian flavors should mix in so well.  I, on the other hand, had a sandwhich which bread was soggy from the juices of the meat/veggies.  From my experience, this should be a somewhat dry sandwhich that relies on the spices and flavor from the meat/veggies to compliment the crispy baguette.  No crispy baguette, and definitely a wet Banh Mi, which I was not looking forward to.  I understand some Banh Mis may be different, but this is definitely not what I am used to from San Diego and LA.\n\nI really want to like this place, as we need more great Asian places in Phoenix, but it definitely did not live up to what I expected.

But I had read the Yelp reviews and knew that.\n\nI stepped up and had trouble finding the ordering line through the people.  While there wasn't a big group ordering, about 6 people were clustered around blocking the window, apparently waiting for their orders to appear.

At 1:38PM my Moki arrived but there was a few minutes more wait for the fried pickle which wasn't ready yet.  Took 20 mins total and this was well past peak lunch hour.  \n\nSat down and looked at what I got (see photos I took).  Other Yelpers are right, the dog is small. The Moki is listed as having green chilis, onions, tomatos, pinto beans, cheddar & mayo. I was anticipating a nice SouthWestern style blend of flavors, but that was absent.  I bit in and none of these flavors jumped out, no chili heat, no flavor burst, no taste of fresh veggies melding.  \nWhat I did get was a sensation of the tough skin texture of the dog, very thick naan bread and a pinto bean absorbtion.  Turning to the fried pickle, its breading kept falling off just leaving the limp, soggy pickle.  I finished the 7 pieces of fried pickle that I had paid $3 for and wondered why the ratings were so high.  \n\nThe dining area I sat in was very windy, blowing fiercely which made the experience forced; a hand off between eating and holding down anything that I had ordered.  Hours later, my iron stomach is still getting belch tones from the dog's meat spices and oil based aromas.  \nThis isn't good.\n\nUnless you're working right across the street and this place was the utmost in convenience, I'd pass.

I was tossed up between the Aiko (mango chutney, jalapenos, red onions, fresh cilantro and mayo) or the Lady (chipotle cream cheese, sauteed onions and fried pickles) - but went with the lady.  I have not stopped thinking about the deliciousness of that dog since it touched my lips.  \n\nSpeaking of fried pickles - I have always loved them, but the fried pickles from Short Leash were hands down the best fried pickles I have ever had.  I need to find out what they put in their batter to give it the spice and crispiness that lasted through the entire meal - no soggy pickles in the end.  \n\nSo if you're a hotdog fan or even if you're not (they will convert you!) find them on Facebook, track them down in the Valley and get some goodness!!", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 6, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Top notch folks!

It was just messy enough to be satisfying without making you look like a sloppy fool while milling around the lot.  And chasing it with local prickly pear soda = heaven.

Not often does a simple picture cause so much commotion, but since the snapshot in question was of a food truck focused on Northeastern seaside cuisine namely Lobster rolls and other such briny delicacies, foodies began buzzing, posting queries clamoring for further details.  Further information about where to find this culinary treasure or whether it actually existed was thin and the discussion seemed to end.\n\nA quick check of the URL www.mainelobsterlady.com got me a contact number to call which led to a rather pleasant conversation and information as to scheduled appearances.  Today, after almost a month of waiting, I went into stealth mode to get into the Arabian Horse Show (who cares about the horses when there's lobster to eat?) and get myself a lobster roll.\n\nThe Maine Lobster Lady operates out of a very tidy, well equipped trailer.  As you approach you can almost smell the salt air and then theres the menu... Two different styles of Lobster roll, shrimp puffs and lobster chowder to name a few.  Barely able to control my glee, I ordered a tradiditonal lobster roll and an order of shrimp puffs.\n\nServed on a hot, butter grilled roll sat easily a half pound of some of the best prepared, most succulent lobster i've ever eaten.  This sandwich is the epitome of simplicity with the barest hint of lemon aioli, chunky lobster tail and claw meat and a buttery sweet roll. I cant even begin to describe how tasty this sandwich was and the $18 price was well worth it.\n\nTo accompany my sandwich were an order of \"shrimp puffs\" ($8.50), think of hushpuppies stuffed with succulent bay shrimp, a crunchy exterior and soft, well seasoned, piping hot interior.  Oh yeah, this was just melt in your mouth delicious when dipped in creamy tartar sauce.\n\nI dont know if you have any interest in horses but if you value your tastebuds and the happiness of your belly, get out to the horse show or find the Maine Lobster Lady at one of her other events this spring and indulge, If you arent able to find her, stay tuned as I eat my way through her menu.

Having already made two breakfast stops prior and with plans for Andreoli's Christmas Festival at 2:00pm I knew I'd need to save room and as such I perused the options carefully before settling on a trio...plus one en route back to the car.\n\nStarting with the most unique, a food truck concept I certainly never saw in the Midwest and would have never expected in the desert, my first stop of the afternoon was at The Maine Lobster Lady (http://www.mainelobsterlady.com/,) a truck described as \"A Maine island girl, along with her very own lobster fishin' partner, serving the real deal Maine Lobster from the coast of Maine to the desert southwest!\" and the menu, service, and accent all hold true to that definition in every way.\n\nPriced substantially higher than the average food truck given the quality of the ingredients my selections from The Maine Lobster Lady would be two - the first her signature Maine Lobster Roll with hot buttered lobster chunks served simply on a grilled roll.  Simple, fresh, and loaded with lobster this was about as simple as it gets and although small considering the $17 price tag it would be hard to quibble this quality of crustacean nearly 3,000 miles from its point of origin as it was every bit as good as that in Boston or elsewhere (where, incidentally, Neptune charges a whopping $22 for their roll.)\n\nMoving next to a more innovative, though less impressive choice, a $9 cone of Maine Shrimp Puffs arrived as a half dozen hush-puppy sized balls of medium sized Maine shrimp tinged with butter and herbs deep fried to golden and served alongside a zippy garlic aioli.  Tender but a bit too oily for my own personal tastes and with the shrimp far less snappy than the aforementioned lobster the aioli was a welcomed boost - a shot of flavor compensating for an otherwise disappointing dish; next time I think I'd go with the Whole Belly Clams or the lobster mac n' cheese.\n\nGood, particularly given the fact that it arrived from a truck in the middle of Phoenix, but pricey at $26 for perhaps a dozen bites of food I see The Maine Lobster Lady as a well conceptualized idea to fill a void, but not someplace I'd seek out unless I really had a craving.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 7, "cool": 5}}, {"text": "Being a New England native I can assure you that this gal gives an accurate representation of some our our beloved seafood dishes (right down to the price).\n\nBut if you think about it , her prices are pretty good for the amount of lobster you get in a roll (i.e. you get what you pay for).\n\nMy mother and I were so excited to see that The Maine Lobster Lady had returned.
