(garden variety) \n\nMisses: \nBaba ghanoush lacked flavor. Consistency was good. \nHummus could use more spice. \nFalafel was overdone, almost to the point of being charred, yet soggy in the middle. \nSpinach pie (spanakopita) was awful. Ricotta cheese and some odd spice that we couldn't name ruined this dish. \nChicken kofta was an odd texture. It's ground chicken, but there's something else about it....\nPitas came straight from a bag. Come on guys, can't you do any better? \n\nAnd completely unrelated to the food.....the bathroom was out of toilet paper. Or seat covers. Or anything resembling a paper product that one might use after relieving themselves. \n\nFinal verdict: Don't waste your time or money.

We ask the Fellow at the counter a question or two, made our decisions, ordered, and paid. We took some of the plasticware and filled out drink cups. We took a nice table with a view of the parking area and the intersection.\n\nI ordered a Number 5, Lamb Kabob Dinner and Libby a Number 3, Chicken Breast Kabob.

The interior was clean, spacious, and cool. It didn't bother us to wait but, I believe that this Express is really a \"Local\".\n\nOur food arrived. Mine was a full plate of seven pieced of wonderfully cooked lamb. Cooked and browned well on the outside and medium rare within. The pieces were about 1.5\" X 1.5 \". They were really nice sized chucks of juicy meat. There was also some romaine with a creamy dressing, seasoned rice, and a nice portion of tomato, onion, parsley salad that I usually call Israeli Salad. It was cold and flavorful.\n\nLibby's chicken kabob dinner was just like mine with the exception of the chicken instead of lamb. The chicken pieces were a hair smaller than my lamb pieces. They were cooked nicely and had a yellow color that I believe was the addition of some turmeric to the chicken marinade. Her chicken was moist and done perfectly. The pita on each plate was about a 3\" size, warm, flavorful, and soaked up a lot of sauce.\n\nI had asked for some Maast Wa Khfar which is yogurt and cumber sauce. It is known in Greek as Tzatziki Sauce. It was cold and had a fine flavor that went well with my Lamb. With our dinner cam a small plastic cup of a green vinegar sauce that was like fire. I am still trying to find out what is in it other than \"grated spices\".

(Sorry Mexican food, as much as I love a taco carts, middle eastern food wind hands down almost every time). \n\nThe cashier and cook were bright eyed guys that seemed much smarter then their present positions. The cashier was very proud of and passionate about the food and the cultures it came from and had quite a lot of information to share about the word derivatives spellings pronunciation and history of the same foods in different regions of the middle east. We both found him welcoming and playful, not over serious about the information, just happy to share. he was explaining the language bases of Iran, Afghanistan, and Arab states talking about how Persian language is actually an Indo- European language with a barely modified Arabic alphabet and Arabic influence.. I never stopped to think it was closer perhaps to French then Arabic.\n\nThe food...pretty awesome. It was clean, well made, and delicious. My mother was particularly enamored with the rice. The only thing we didn't finish was the pita. it was nothing special and a little dry.\n\nThe menu was limited in terms of vegetables. This was my only real complaint. I guess its better to do something small and do it well but places with limited vegetables lowers the standard a little for me. I eat meat but don't always and am a much happier eater if there are lots of  veggies. Wile there were several options for kabob there were only sides of a grilled eggplant dish, a spinach dish, and a green salad and the same green salad with chicken on it as an entree. more veggies please!\n\nThe atmosphere was well lit and clean. There was some culture specific art on the walls from Afghanistan (remember  that haunting national geographic photo of the girl with the amazing eyes?) and Iran and there was a fair amount of seating and the tables and chairs were better then usual for a strip mall restaurant but you could still tell you were in a strip mall. We carried out because we were dressed poorly having stopped there after doing some construction in the house. I  was afraid I'd get  construction dust on the chairs if i sat down. And the other diners were dressed like  professional people, some button down shirts a few polo shirts and slacks.. so it was nice enough for me in my ripped and paint covered work clothes to feel well under-dressed. I'd say its classy for a strip mall but you still go to the counter and take your order and get served on a standard red restaurant tray.\n\nOther customers were speaking in what sounded like the few farsi words i know.

The beef to my surprise was so tender I was able to separate it with just my fork. My favorite was the Kefta.

I didn't mind since I was able to taste it throughout the day, it was that good.
