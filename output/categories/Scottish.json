However, the loveliness of my evening was due almost entirely to the company I was with, as well as the friendliness of the wait staff.  \nThe food was what really fell short here...and the chairs, the incredibly uncomfortable chairs.  \nIt was by no means bad, but it just didn't WORK very well. \n\nFor starters I had- pumpkin gnocchi with shredded ham hock, slow roasted cherry tomatoes & bocconcini.  It was nice, and definitely my favorite dish of the evening.  The texture of the gnocchi was a bit unusual but ultimately the flavors of the dish went together nicely.  \nAlso, considering the size of the dish, it was a bargain at \u00a35.95.  However, as it was a starter, I didn't want it to be that large.  It filled me up to the point I where I didn't need anything else to eat, and I hadn't even finished it!\nMy friend had the smoked halibut, baby spinach & goats cheese roulade with radish & watercress salad, roast yellow pepper & Arran mustard vinaigrette.  She asked if the yellow pepper could be left off, and they kindly replaced it with a reduced balsalmic (though, to be honest, I never noticed balsalmic anything).  We swapped starters so I had the chance to try this one as well.  The goats cheese roulade completely overwhelmed the halibut in both size and flavor.  The proportion of cheese to fish seemed to indicate that one was expected to take large mouthfuls of cheese with a tiny sliver of fish as an accompaniment.  I like cheese as much as the next person, but it was simply too much.  Even tiny accents of the cheese taken with the fish overwhelmed the flavor and ultimately I managed only a few bites before I gave up, uninterested.    \n\nAfter our massive starters, even stretched out over about an hour and a half, we weren't hungry in the least.  Feeling too guilty to spend so much time at the table and have only wine and starters, we ordered a main to share.  We chose the braised Portobello mushrooms stuffed with black crowdie on a borlotti bean, white cabbage, plum tomato & basil stew, confit garlic coulis.  The mushrooms were nice, but the black crowdie had the texture of hard styrofoam and the beans were undercooked to the point of being hard.  The flavors and presentation were all quite nice but the individual elements were extremely lacking.  This dish was also immense and there is NO way I could have finished it alone.\n\nWe also noticed that all mains are served with a small side of steamed vegetables - new potatoes, carrots, broccoli and snow peas.  I'm not sure why they do this because while we all love veggies, they didn't compliment the dish (and it doesn't seem they would compiment anything on the menu), I certainly didn't need any more food, and really just think that the restaurant is wasting money on a completely unnecessary extra.  \n\nThe icing on the cake was when I was sitting in bed later that evening and my stomach was rumbling unhappily.  Not with hunger and certainly not as a result of over-eating, but clearly unimpressed by the sub-par meal.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I've eaten here a number of times in the past (including one Xmas dinner) and can safely say I've had no complaints about the service or food.

As they say on their website, their aim is to showcase the best of local, Scottish produce and serve it in simple but beautiful ways. \n\nI went for lunch on a Lunch Quest with Blythe R, Katey L and Blythe's friend. Between the four of us we tried several different dishes. They have a fantastic deal on lunch: \u00a311.50 for two courses. I, accidentally, didn't realise that it was only asterixed items on the menu, so didn't get this deal in the end. But if you follow it, it's fantastic value.\n\nI rarely start with soup, but the apple and celeriac soup sounded so good I had to have it. And in Blythe R's accompany (the Soup King of Edinburgh) I felt I should go the soup route. I'm so glad I did. With a walnut on top, I could taste both walnut and apple very strongly, but not overpoweringly, in the soup. And it had such a nice, light texture more like a velout\u00e9 - well, half way between a foamy, airy velout\u00e9 and a hearty soup. It was at once filling, and rich in flavour, but also delicate on the palate and light enough I could manage it all and (half) my main.\n\nMy grilled salmon fillet with potato croquettes and peppers? Divine. Absolutely divine. On my first mouthful I felt like I'd been transported to sitting on a mediteranean beach-front restaurant, eating freshly caught fish, grilled in the mediteranean fashion on a sun-soaked summer holiday. All of that feeling and memories from one mouthful. It was beautifully fresh fish, cooked perfectly with that nice grilled taste. My only regret was that there weren't more potato croquettes with it. Given that Blythe's hake came with a big stack of chunky chips, my salmon fillet had a modest 3 potato croquettes which were on the small side themselves.

Hmmm.\n\nThe restaurant itself was perfect for a mid-week lunch. A sunny day, the room small room as lit up with outside light. The music was perfect (background jazz-type music).

It was full at lunch time with laid back lunchers like us. \n\nI can't wait to go back, and do hope it stays popular yet not overly packed in a 'so hot right now' way.

Field's mission statement is to take the concepts of Michelin dining and turn it into a relaxed affair and that's a breath of fresh air indeed.\n\nOpening in January of this year, the restaurant is run by an ambitious team who have taken their experiences from several notable establishments and put their own spin on fine dining.\n\nChef Gordon Craig for example, has worked at the Roux family's Waterside Inn, the Michelin starred Peat Inn and the Plumed Horse, while Ma\u00eetre D' Richard Conway worked at the later as restaurant manager.\n\nMy partner Sarah couldn't manage to this one, so I invited my brother Chris instead and he kindly added some professional photography skills to my humble blog. \n\nRichard greeted us warmly when we arrived  and we admired the freshness and feel of the dining area as the sunshine beamed through the windows. \n\nInstantly relaxed, you could tell there was going to be no pretention about Field and the giant cow picture brought both a talking point and a statement about the ethos of the restaurant.\n\nOur menus came playfully in a luminous green picture frames and offered an intriguing mix of seasonal dishes.  \n\nAs we awaited our order, we tucked into some delicious homemade sun dried tomato bread.  Always pleasing to see bread being made in house.\n\nChris opted for the asparagus, poached egg, parmesan crisp and pickled shimeji (\u00a35.95), while I went for beetroot cured Scottish salmon, citrus cr\u00e8me fraiche, raisin and caper compote, pickled peppers and crispy crab ball (\u00a35.25).\n\nMy starter was the perfect choice for a summery day: fresh, clean, light and zingy, it utilised the colours on the plate well and showed off some good quality ingredients.\n\nThe salmon was wonderfully tender and paired well with the bite of the pickled peppers. The citrus of the cr\u00e8me fraiche and flavours of the compote really excited the palette. The crab ball was crisp and had a pleasant note of dill through it, which I really liked.\n\nChris's asparagus came nicely chargrilled and still had suitable bite to it.  He burst the egg yolk to release a rich and velvety liquid centre that complimented the asparagus. The pickled mushroom gave a good contrast to the plate too, while the sauce brought it together. \n\nThis dish was simple yet effective and the chef really allows the ingredients to do the talking.\n\nI'm a man who really enjoys a good burger and after a fellow blogger recommended Field's chorizo burger (\u00a39.95)  earlier in the week, my mind was already made up on my main course.\n\nMoist and tasty, the burger didn't disappoint.  It was a tad pink in places, which would probably put a few people off but I like my meat that way and gladly polished it off.  The sweet potato chips were very earthy and without a hint of grease on them.   \n\nHowever, the spicy mayo could have done with a bit more oomph for me.\n\nEnjoying his first Phil's Food World outing, Chris went for the pan friend hake with creamed sweetcorn, avocado, chorizo and chunky chips (\u00a311.95). \n\nThe hake was very fresh and the flesh inside soft and flaky but we felt the skin could have been crisper.  Chris enjoyed the creamed sweetcorn in particular, as it partnered the fish superbly and was well seasoned and vibrant.   \n\nYou could tell the perfectly uniform manner in which the chorizo and avocado had been cut that this is a chef that cares what comes out of his kitchen.\n\nChris's generous portion of chips was equally as good as mine, which shows a good level of consistency and they dipped nicely into the creamed corn too!\n\nSo, to the third and final course and I went for coconut panna cotta with roasted pineapple and creamed gingerbread (\u00a34.95) with Chris selecting peach tart tatin with Birds custard ice cream (\u00a35.50).\n\nThe panna cotta was just set and no more and tasted pleasant.  The coconut on the outside added texture and enhanced the coconut taste of the mild set cream.\n\nThe pineapple in this Caribbean inspired dish worked with the coconut but could have been roasted a little more to add another dimension of flavour.  Unfortunately, I didn't really get anything from the gingerbread cream element.\n\nChris ordered peach tart tatin with Birds custard ice cream and was impressed with the way the home-made ice cream balanced out the sharpness of syrup. The tart itself was very tasty and the pastry was expertly cooked. The ice cream was certainly a notable highlight of this pudding.\n\nField has only been open around six months and is certainly one to watch. The team's philosophies and menus are excellent and extremely good value for money. It'll be interesting to see the restaurant develop in the near future.\n\nI have to say it's certainly one of the friendliest and most relaxing restaurants I've visited in a while.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "It's small but simple.\n\nBut by jee ... the menu was full of dishes that i wanted - this is good.  \n\nThe food was damn tasty!

Focus is on local sourcing and showcasing the best of ingredients. Sample menu's on-line but subject to change as it is all about what is seasonal and available at the time.\n\nWent firstly for my birthday. Blythe R had been raving about it for ages and particularly had pointed out how amazing they were for gluten free so with that recommendation, it was on the to-do list. We were a party of seven and everyone kept saying how much they loved their dinner - like Carol W, I had the maple glazed duck, wild mushroom samosa (yep, gf!), grilled pak choi, sweet potato fondant and chartreuse sauce and it was all divine! I had also started with the Salmon so when it came to dessert, I passed to instead have tea. \n\nWell, I thought I wouldn't have dessert. Two of the girls ordered dessert and as we all tried and started making Meg Ryan sex noises (think sandwich shop in When Harry Met Sally) as it was THAT good, I ordered dessert and shared it round all the non dessert eaters. So - the dessert in question? A jaffa cake macaroon - completely gluten free - macaroon base, chocolate sorbet, orangey centre, cream and little chocolate dome to hide the orangey goodness then it is amazing, hence the 2nd visit.\n\nSecond visit was really for dessert but we figured we needed a main first and a gorgeous bottle of Yealand Sauv Blanc - as you do.

NOT AT ALL. The pork was perfectly cooked (pre-sliced for me) and the fat cripsy and salty. The pearl barley risotto was nice and milky. The sliced apple pieces provided a good cut to lighten the taste and add to the texture. This was a stand out dish. I finished it with the chocolate brownie and peanut butter ice cream (which i shared with my dining companion). The brownie tasted sugarless and flourless (not in a good way), but the ice cream (made in the restaurant) was decadent. Exactly what an American living in London missing peanut butter needed. \nI also recommend the Sicilian bottle of Shiraz. Very surprised at how smooth it was.\n\nThere is a reason this is not five stars - and it's because of my companion's meal. it really didn't measure up.

The baked avocado was insane. I mean it was, quite literally, mind-boggingly delicious. Baked to perfection and topped with cheese, chorizo and sweetcorn it was just one of the tastiest combos I have ever had. It sat alongside the pork belly really well and is something I will absolutely be making (attempting) at home.

I cheekily asked if I could have a side of the avocado that goes with the pork belly - baked avocado with sweet corn & chorizo gratin which wasn't a problem and I was delighted that I got this addiction as it was so sweet and creamy, the salty chorizo and pops of corn meant I wolfed this down pretty quickly. The duck was excellent with crispy skin and nice and juicy inside.

Shortly after he brought me the spoots, along with delicious hunks of monkfish, asparagus, green bean and pea salad. All served with, what I kid you not, was one of the best sauces I have tasted. After finishing I even asked for a spoon, not wanting to waste a drop. Monkfish and spoots are easy to overcook and turn horribly rubbery. Not here.

We had a chance after all. I was told I'd be emailed with vegan options, and sure enough a couple of hours later I had an email. What's more, I had a booking too!

In mitigation I think I wandered in on possibly the first night of opening but none of the staff seemed to know whether they were serving at the bar, waiting on tables, stocking the bar, taking dinner bill payments from customers or what. Consequently the bar area became a bottle-neck, diners were heard to be complaining about a number of issues and getting a single pint took about ten minutes. The menu though looks inviting so I'll happily revisit in the Summer and see if things have calmed down. Having now revisited for the purpose of having dinner I can safely say that things in terms of service have improved & our waitress last night was very efficient. My companion & I both ordered steak from the (probably necessarily) limited evening menu and we both felt that the serving was slightly overpriced for the size but had no complaints about the cooking itself. The brioche bread & butter pudding was of ample size & moreish, if not exactly a summer dessert.

A full week had passed since a section of the ceiling had fell away - mere days after opening - only to be repaired within a matter of hours. Obviously the story had stuck in his mind but looking around he could see the staff buzzing about a hive of tables, most occupied by friends and lovers, lost in conversation\n\nThe Other Place was very much back in business.\n\nFeeling a little foolish, and hoping Jennie hadn't noticed, he straightened up and they took their seats; a small, round, European-influenced table, far enough from the patio doors to avoid the glare of the sun yet close enough to appreciate the cooling breeze that whipped by outside.\n\nAlmost instantly they were greeted by their waitress, a petit and cheerful girl with an accent that served to echo their surroundings. They placed the usual drinks order: a white wine (large) for her; a Jack and Coke (Diet) for him.\n\nTypically they discussed the events that had momentarily staggered the Other Place's opening week. Looking up, they could easily differentiate between old and new ceilings. The largest flat section was now a spread of grey mortar, but all the rest retained its classic elegance. There were three sections over the bar area in all, chandeliers hung centrally from all, but the older two also held circular mirrors that rounded the light fixtures, and the detailed cornicing, with its ornate engravings, were captivating.\n\nA moment later Joe spotted their drinks, albeit atop a waiter's tray that was headed the wrong way. The waiter seemed not to know where the beverages were destined to be but Joe certainly did and intervened just as the waitress with the accent pointed out their table.\n\nThe summer weather had drawn an unexpected crowd, or so it seemed from the tables that had been amassed inside. This by no means made their stay uncomfortable but the impromptu table layout was obviously leading the waiting staff a merry chase as a result. Spirits were high and the waiter made his apologies by way of some charming banter, which they both appreciated.\n\nThen their waitress returned. \"Ready to order?\" she said with an enthusiastic smile.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Joe replied. \"If the portion is big enough, we'd like to share the Spicy Shrimp and Chorizo starter...?\"\n\nHe glanced at Jennie as he spoke, her cool green eyes glittering thoughtfully as if she was trying to calculate how much food she might manage, before she confirmed his choice with a nod.\n\nJoe smiled appreciatively, \"And for mains...?\" He gestured to his partner to take the lead.\n\n\"I'll have the Chilli Cheese Dog with extra Fried Onions,\" Jennie said, decisively.\n\n\"And for me, the Juicy Lucy with the Hash Brown topping.\"\n\nWhile they waited for their first course, they took in the place. Beforehand it had been an old gentleman's public house, with a name involving a Stag or some other woodland creature no doubt. The transformation was impressive; the room in which they sat now the bar area, while the upper level housed the open-face kitchen, artfully circled by an array of stools for those who wished to watch their food being prepared.\n\nThe bar itself was rather impressive too, Art Deco in style - much like the majority of the decor and furnishings - with a vast selection of bourbons and rums, whiskies and wines on display. Joe had heard rumour they stocked 100 various beers and ales back there too.\n\nThe Shrimp and Chorizo dish could not have been any better. A perfect sharing dish, but good enough to make Joe wish he'd bought his own. The shrimp soft and delicate, the chorizo veritably haemorrhaging flavour; it needed to be tried to be believed. Joe initially added the romantic touch of sharing the dish with the same fork, however he had clearly forgotten how slowly Jennie tended to eat, so - once he'd tasted that chorizo - snapped up the spare fork with fervour.\n\nEqually so, they enjoyed their mains. The Chilli Dog as messy animal indeed, and Jennie used her cutlery wisely, albeit to Joe's horror (few things in this world must be eaten by hand but both burgers and hotdogs are at the apex of that list). The chilli itself, which they had experienced once before, was interesting in that it closer resembled pulled pork, but in no way was that a criticism; it was delightful.\n\nThe burger patty was handmade, and clearly so as it crumbled juicily with each bite. Stuffed with subtle cheese and topped with a flaky hash brown, his only gripe was that the latter was under-seasoned. Despite that negative, he made a note to contact all his friends on the quest for Edinburgh's Best Burger to take note of The Other Place.\n\nThe meal had been a test. A test of the Other Place and what they were bringing to the capital. A test of how they intended to compete with neighbouring Stockbridge without being as wanky.

I'd heard their chilli fries were good, the window seats adorably cosy (and the windows open during the summer) and it was just a laid-back, nice bar in Canonmills.\n\nSo I popped down here for lunch, and went for the BBQ Hot Dog (see the photo!) The hot dog itself was really thin, like a really thin sausage. It was made with 50% beef and 50% pork...but I was a little disheartened at the size. But the BBQ-sauce simmered onions that came with it were plentfiul and delicious. It was a really nice hot dog, I just would have liked more of it! The chips that came with it were tooooo good though, and if I hadn't gorged myself on chips and cheese at 3am the previous night, I would have eaten them all!\n\nI'll definitely come back here to try more, especially the burgers (one with a melting cheesy middle). The tables are a little small and not the ideal size / shape. Not bad, but just not...my ideal seating arrangement.\n\nBut yep, I liked The Other Place!

The place was busy, so we were given a table at the very back, next to the open kitchen.  So, where we were was actually quite quiet, but also fairly soulless, it wasn't til we went to the loo that we had the chance to see just how nice the rest of the place is.  Next time I'll come at a less busy time in the hope of getting one of the tables nearer the bar...\n\nSister ordered a cider, I had the house lager which was nice - both priced just below \u00a34. When we ordered a repeat, we were given two lagers. This was probably my fault, as whereas my sister said \"the same again\" I said \"yes, the lager please\", but the mistake was rectified swiftly and we were actually charged for the lagers (which was cheaper than the cider).\n\nThe menu, oh I wanted to eat it all! But that would have been immensely greedy of myself, so I opted for the Juicy Lucy (or, a classier version of chip shops' Cheeznburger) - a delicious meat patty with the cheese on the inside. This meant that the bun was quite dry, but I smothered on some mayonnaise and voila, problem rectified! The chips were okay but verging on cold by the time they arrived (and it took a while), and a few were slightly undercooked. Sister had the tuna melt, which looked good, and the garlic chips - not that the garlic was particularly detectable.\n\nWe both ordered the 'pie a la mode', as we were still hungry, a pleasant pecan pie. But completely overpriced at \u00a35 for what was a rather small slice. In fact, price is really my main issue. My burger was \u00a310.50, which is a good pound or so more than similar establishments would charge.\n\nSo, for the moment The Other Place gets 3 stars.

So, here's the good news: the beef brisket chilli is really good - spicy, tasty, rich, thick and satisfying, this is chilli as it should be, while the use of slow-cooked brisket gives it an unpretentious twist on the usual gastropub effort. Add a cold beer and you'll walk away from The Other Place with a happy tummy and the beginnings of a good review in your head.\n\nSadly though, the food goes rapidly downhill from there. A grilled king prawn sandwich with paprika mayo sounds great, but it doesn't really tally with the prawn cocktail mix slapped between two slices of stale white bread that ends up on your plate.

Disappointing!\n\nThis is the 2nd ever place I've scored this low... in a month! Now either I've turned even more crabbit than normal or I've had amazingly bad luck with restaurants recently. I like to think the latter :)\n\nThis was my second visit here using an itison voucher deal. After the first crappy experience with bad service and appallingly cremated food (or i think it used to be food at some point) i vowed never to go back however someone bought my mum a voucher for her birthday and she asked me to go with her. Having such low expectations I thought \"surely, it can't be worse than the last time\". Boy, was I wrong! \n\nThe voucher consisted of a cocktail and a starter and main meal each. I opted for a mojito which in the spectrum of cocktail quality was probably rated in the lower end. Very amateur, the kind anyone could rustle up in their house. NOT the quality one would expect from their \"cocktail bar\". However, this in itself isn't a deal breaker. \n\nThe service was slooooooowwwwww! Far too long waiting for the drinks order to be taken, then compounded by an inexcusable wait for the starter. I'm talking about an hour!!! \n\nThe menu was small and contained poorly designed choices in my opinion. This is either a sign of an inexperienced chef or a way to penny pinch and skimp for us pesky voucher buyers!  No decent restaurant in their right mind would offer 2 mediocre vegetarian soups in the same menu (one a chilled tomato soup at that. Yuch), and a chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 which they replaced with salmon as they had run out. Chicken replaced with fish?!? Riiiiiight...... As a non-fish eater, after asking if the chef could do anything else for me as I didn't like any of the starter options the waitress discussed salad options, going through the types of cheeses, nuts, fruits etc i liked for including in the salad. Initially I thought it a good sign they were willing to accommodate me. After the obscenely long wait (which was explained away as the chef 'specially' preparing my salad) what appeared was a very small bowl of hairy salad (you know, the cheap, curly bitter stuff that nobody likes) dressed in olive oil (no other flavouring) and some finely sliced sun dried peppers (well I THINK they were peppers but they were so chewy and wouldn't actually break down upon chewing, they were totally inedible). The waitress had the grace to look embarrassed but I lost all respect for her when she asked me if it looked ok. I was like (whilst poking at it with my fork) \"errrrrr... I'm not sure what the long wait was for. There is literally nothing in this salad\". No response. After eating a couple if hairy, curly, bitter salad leaves I left it. No comment from the waitress as she sheepishly removed my plate. My mum's smoked salmon wasn't much better which was served with an unpleasantly bitter Lemon mayonnaise. \n\nFor the main I chose loin of pork as did my mum. The only other options were sea bass and an artichoke tart. After about 40 minutes, during which we watched everyone else get served (clearly not voucher holders) and who I can only presume to be some kind of manager, crane his neck at our table from the back of the restaurant a couple of times to see if our food had arrived before scurrying into the kitchen (didn't have the balls to actually come to the table himself and apologise)... we walked out. Our Views were strongly expressed at reception as to how shoddy the experience was from start to finish and how we'd never be back. \n\nPeople who buy vouchers are not second class citizens and just because it's Prepaid does not give a restaurant the excuse to serve any old slop in whatever time frame they feel like. The fact this voucher was a gift made it even more embarrassing as we had to let the buyer know what happened so they could complain and get a refund. \n\nThis was exactly the same during my first visit shortly after they first opened.

It was such a nice treat, well-sized and very good to have after such a great main. \n\nNow the dessert, again so full, but luckily both desserts were so light and just wow! The first was a smoked pumpkin mousse, chocolate cream and hazelnut meringue. The pumpkin was surprisingly addicting and the hazelnuts have it a nice texture. The chocolate cream was rich, but not too sweet and it went so well with the pumpkin. The second dessert was toasted brioche, char-grilled apple, barley ice-cream and carrot and crowdie mousse. It was also to die for. The crowdie and carrot mouse was absolutely 'divine' as Paula Dean would say. It was so lovely.\n\nThe entire experience, meal and service was beyond any expectations I had and I was thoroughly impressed. It definitely is a splash and not something I would do often, but it is so worth it for a special occasion or something different. I would recommend this to anyone who is loves food and doesn't mind being served a meal selected by people who know what they are doing with food. \n\nIf you are picky or have any dietary things they do offer to try to accommodate those, but I personally would say don't bother trying it if you aren't a wee bit adventurous.

We were a table of 8 but given the timescales for serving our food, forcing some people to start before others have been served, the kitchen clearly isn't geared up for big numbers. \n3. The food is a bit overpriced in my opinion. And I base this view on the quantity of my starter and the quality of my main dish.\n4. My starter of cep and ricotta raviolo in a mushroom consume was delicious (really, really tasty in fact!) however what bugged me is that the portion was soooooo tiny. One raviolo sitting in a huge white plate with a small hole in the middle. For 6 bucks I expect a bigger portion. This isn't a Michelin star restaurant so I don't feel they can't justify high end prices. \n5. My main of pork belly, pork cheek and pork fillet with lentils was a bit of a mixed bag. The pork cheek was lovely and I'd have happily eaten that on its own in a bigger portion however the fillet was tough and chewy and so was the pork belly. Overcooked pork is pretty dry.

As Laura D mentioned, there were lots of little fruit flies constantly buzzing around. They kept landing on my glass, they fell into two people's glasses.

I was sorely disappointed. First, during Yelp's Brunchy Munchy, I thought my pancakes with bacon tasted ok but were quite overpriced for two itsy bitsy pancakes and a lack of friendliness on the part of the staff. The restaurant was attractively decorated and they did accommodate our large group, but without much grace as many others really didn't like what they were served.\n\nAlthough I really wanted to like the Edinburgh Larder Bistro because of their mission to serve good quality food made from locally-sourced ingredients, I was on the fence after the brunch about whether I liked this place. I wanted to give it a second try, so my boyfriend and I purchased a groupon for a two-course lunch here. Since I work from home and his work is also flexible, we had brought our backpacks with our computers with us so we could work from New Town in the afernoon. When we showed up at our appointed time for our reservation, the staff looked us up and down and led us to the back room (they obviously wanted to hide us in the back!). At our table, the woman looked us up and down again and, after a long pause and looking disdainingly at our bags, said that other customers would be coming in and sitting next to us so could she take our bags to the other room since they would need the space? She could have framed this much more tactfully and asked if she could help us by relieving us of our bags by taking them out of our way!\n\nAlthough things had a rocky start, I liked the simple menu of just a few items that were the fresh specialties of the day made from in-season, local ingredients. We both had the mushroom soup to start. The soup was good and better than a run-of-the-mill cream of mushroom soup but it wasn't too special or memorable. Since we had heard about the Larder Bistro's great bread and thought that bread would be the perfect addition to our starter, we were a bit sad that we weren't served any. Later, during our main course, we were frustrated to see other customers were served bread with their soup while we had not been!\n\nFor my main, I had the fish. While I was expecting a flavourful, locally-caught fish, I was underwhelmed by the dish. Although it scored high on presentation and looked quite pretty, it's taste wasn't on the same calibre. To make things worse, when I was over half-way through my meal I found a hair in my dish. I didn't think it was mine but then again I wasn't quite sure. I ate a bit more from other parts of my plate but that was the not-so-perfect end to our lunch.\n\nEven though the Larder Bistro might had wanted more posh customers and we didn't seem to meet their expectations, they should have treated us just as well as the other customers (the two older ladies sitting a few tables away, or the couple sitting behind us -- and, no, there was still no one actually sitting at either of the tables next to us!). The other customers were welcomed warmly, had their coats kindly taken out of their way and received bread with their soup. We aren't slobs and we were a bit taken aback by the poor service and underwhelming lunch after hearing such lovely reviews prior to our visits here.

Is it the quality of ingredients? I don't know. \n\nThis visit we have been on a Living Social voucher set meal. \nOffered was a prosecco and a choice of 2 coursed out of 3 starters , 3 mains and 3 desserts.\n\nThe prosecco was a little too dry and not very pleasant to drink - happens sometimes - personal taste and not their doing of course. I may have benefitted from a splash of Cr\u00e8me de cassis to sweeten it up a bit?  \n\nWe got a complimentary bread and herb (& garlic?) butter. Standard.\nFor starter I had the wild mushroom soup and which was tasty. The bread served was the same as the basket. \n\nFor main we both took the Rump of Lamb, with stem broccoli, spring onions, sliced cream potato and a jus. As advised the lamb was served pink. \nThe portion was adequate, I personally would have loved more of the potato as that was very well prepared and just a 2' square didn't do it justice. The bottom part of the broccoli was a little tough (el dente?). \nThe lamb was well cooked and indeed pinkish as promised, taste wise however it lacked seasoning, which was offset by the jus. I did decided to ask for some additional jus as there just wasn't enough to mop up. It wasn't the juiciest of meats, but I had much worse served in other places. So OK. \nThe spring onions were for some strange reason not easy to digest or chew, I spent a good deal masticating, but had to admit defeat. \n\nThe dessert was a selection of ice cream and cookies supplied by Affagato Ice Cream parlour from across the road. It was again ok, but it was just that tiny bit crystallised, it was a bit grainy - the spoon did not slice through, but was glaciered and skirting on the surface of the scoop. Weird.   \n\nIn conclusion: again I was underwhelmed and dissapointed.

The new focus seems to be the quality (\"craft\") beer and food combo.  The Hanging Bat, Brewdog and Vintage lead the way, with the refurbished Fountain and renovated Elm Bar now the Jeremiah Taproom.  Added to the list is the brand new Safari Lounge, which was the Station Bar on Cadzow Place, Abbeyhill.  Until recently a relatively untouched classic Edinburgh pub (reviewed separately on Yelp) with the infamous Safari Lounge at the back.  The new owners appear to have grabbed that concept and refurbbed to covert the whole pub to the Safari Lounge.  Nice decor, still reminiscent of the original, long narrow with 3 relatively separate spaces to sit, including the original Safari Lounge at the back with its own fantastic cocktail bar.\n\nFood now features prominently with meze style offerings, hot dogs etc.  All seems to be high quality.  Good range of beer both on draft and bottle.  It does not appear to be aiming at the high end beer market (like Vintage) but there is some quality on offer.  Actually the new high end beer places have their own niche but can miss the mark a wee bit as decent, warm, inviting pubs in the old style.  I found that the Safari Lounge had this sort of genuine pub character in spades and actually probably my favourite sort of hangout (it reminded me of the Pond on Salamander St when it first reopened a few years back).  Bit more relaxed but cool.  Good friendly staff, decent welcome.  \n\nAll in all I REALLY like this place. Just a bit out of the way so a bit more selective in terms of client\u00e8le.

However, we managed to secure a table in the back room. A really friendly waitress came to take our drinks orders and we studied the menus. I have to say the Safari Lounge menu is the most interesting and diverse I have seen for ages. I mean - mussel popcorn, anyone? Or would you rather have some sushi? Don't worry - they've got it all covered.\n\nWe ordered mussel popcorn and chicken wings for starters. Both were very tasty. There was a little pot of tartar sauce to go with the mussels.\n\nMain courses for 3 were lemon and black pepper chicken with thai slaw and salad, jungle king prawn curry and ribs and potatoes. Just like the starters, everything was well on flavour. The ribs were amazing - tender juicy meat falling off the bone. The accompanying potato slices were a tad too salty for my taste, though. Jungle curry had amazing flavours and it came with a couple of chapatis on the side.\n\nI really enjoyed my lunch here.

We ordered a side order of fries as well. I was concerned that this might not be enough but in the event it was perfect. (I'd go for fries along with your hot dog if you're a greedy git like me as the hot dog on it's own probably won't be enough, for most guys anyway)\nThe bun was nice and light and airy and seemed to be lightly toasted on the inside.\nThe bratwurst just seemed like an ordinary bratwurst but was nice and went well together with the chilli on top (though the chilli was a tad dry perhaps and I didn't get a huge amount of flavour from it) I didn't get much impact from the manchego either to be honest I wouldn't have been able to tell you it was there actually and I think without the juiciness of the bratwurst the whole thing  may have been a tad dry. This is nitpicking though as overall it was pretty decent. My friend who's tried the chilli dogs in America seemed pretty impressed. \nThe hot dog came with a small side salad- lettuce and finely diced cucumber, which could have been a tad oily for some but I liked.\nThe decor of the bar is sort of jungley, retro chic with animal heads on the wall and the waitresses were friendly and service good. \nSo all in all I'd recommend it, not amazing but definitely competent, a tad pricey (the jungle dog was \u00a38.95 I think, certainly \u00a38 something) but definitely not extortionate. If I could I'd maybe only give 3.75 stars but anyway definitely worth a try. Plus they have some good bottled beers, my friend had a Weisbier I'd never seen before.\nOne final thing though, I saw that the menu contained momo fuku and sushi.
