Delicious and SO chocolatey!! My boyfriend had the waffle with nutella and I have to admit I stole about half of it. delicious waffle!!!\n\n\n At the end, I went upstairs for the bathroom, and saw that the best seats are actually on the top floor! With a bird's eye view on the Royal mile, you can people watch from just about any comfy seat (it's armchairs-only upstairs!!) thanks to well-placed mirrors.
