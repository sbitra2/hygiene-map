The hash browns took up a whole third of the plate real estate, but that was unfortunate as they were rather tasteless.  They were lacking in the salt/grease/butter department.  Next up, my eggs were overcooked in the yolk part but somehow not cooked enough in the whites.  It was weird, but still edible and not the way I like them.  The bacon... well there was a lot of it.  I thought that was a wonderful thing until I bit into overly fatty bacon that was cooked for way too long.  It was just really salty and crunchy.  For the first time ever, I did not eat all of the bacon in front of me.  The biscuits and gravy was by far the worst part of my meal.  The biscuits were very hard, dry, and flavorless.  It was as if they had been sitting out for at least a few days.  The gravy was pretty bad.  It was completely over-peppered and was super thick and congealed.  It wobbled instead of dripped.

There were five of us, and it was just the standard family get-together.  The wait was not too long, only about ten minutes, before we had a table and menus.  This is not typical, I think we just got lucky.\n\nThe Ranch House has been a favorite with us for years, we've eaten at the Page restaurant as well as the Phoenix restaurant, which recently re-opened after a too-long remodelling hiatus.  Apparantly, there were some issues with the old building, code requirements and kitchen equipment, but happily for all, it has been resolved, and the Ranch House is back in action in the same building, essentially the same dining room, but now with a front door added.  There is also a nice, covered, vine-shaded patio with a couple of tables.  This time of year, too hot for me.\n\nAmazingly, I've never had the green-chile CF steak.  This was the day to change that.  Ordered my eggs Over-medium and please bring a big glass of iced tea.  The wife had Huevos Rancheros, D1 had oatmeal with strawberries, D2 had a French-Dip and MIL had a turkey sandwich.  Yes, indeed, they serve anything off the menu anytime of day.\n\nPeople have raved about the Green Chile and I've waited so long, my expectations were pretty high.  Fortunately, I was not disappointed.  I think the Chile could have been hotter, but that's a personal preference.  It was a savory, flavorful sauce, with chunks of tender and tasty pork.  This sauce was draped over a decent-sized portion of Chicken-Fried Steak and topped with a small pile of melting cheddar cheese.  The steak had a nice breading, still crispy, yet the meat was tender and easy to chew.   The eggs were slightly over-cooked, but the yolk was still perfectly runny, they just had a tough, brown edge that says the fire was too hot.  Hash browns were browned and crispy and this came with a side of toast, I had Rye.  The toast was your basic plain bread, nothing to brag about.  \n\nThe wife was not so impressed with her dish, she is vegetarian, and said the green chile had too much pork/pork flavoring, the rice was flavorless and the beans tasted like pork.  Her eggs were cooked perfectly and she enjoyed the house-made salsa.  D2, as usual only ate half of her French-Dip sandwich, and so dad got to finish it.  I didn't try the Au Jus, but the beef was tasty and tender, with a bit of melted Provolone on a soft French roll.  I had it as leftovers, zapped in the astro-chef and slathered with mayonnaise.  It was tasty.\n\nEverybody else seemed to like their food, and the young male waiter enjoyed flirting awkardly with D1, who pretty much just rolled her eyes.  The iced tea was good, service was acceptable, not exceptional, but we were not ignored.

Let that sink into your head before I tell you about Ranch House.\n\nI visited Scottsdale for Memorial weekend this year.  On our first morning there, my partner and I had just finished a little morning hike at Papago and decided that we should have some brunch.  We found this gem thanks to Yelp.\n\nThis place is a straight-up no nonsense down home cafe.  There's country music playing faintly in the background and it's the kind of place that probably has a lot of regulars.  It's seat-yourself style so you just go in and pop a squat at a table.\n\nI have been to some pretty spectacular \"world-class\" famous restaurants here in LA, but Ranch House had the best waitress I have ever encountered.  A friendly young girl came over and introduced herself (think her name was Ashley) and this girl is seriously the best waitress I've ever had, and like I said I've eaten at Michelin star places.\n\nAt Ranch House, you pretty much just order how many eggs you want and what kind of meat you want.  Everything comes with hash browns and then either toast, pancakes or biscuits n gravy.  Ashley informed us that her favorite was the biscuits n gravy so we of course had to take her up on them.\n\nI got bacon and my partner got the 8 oz steak.  He ordered it rare, because he likes medium rare but places usually cook things too well from what you say so he was assuming it would actually come out medium rare.\n\nWell, it didn't, it came out straight-up rare and all cold in the middle.  I know this is totally all his fault for ordering it rare.  Ashley brought it out and immediately read his mind.  She asked if he really wanted it that rare or if he wanted it taken back to be thrown on for a few minutes--he obliged her and it came back PERFECTLY medium rare.  We both proceeded to feel dumb, btw.\n\nAnyway, my bacon was floppy and thick-cut and I loved it.  The scrambled eggs were perfect.  The hash browns were some of the best I've ever had.  Loved every single thing about the meal.  Even their coffee here is brewed stuff and was a perfect wake-me-up after an early morning hike in the desert.  They put cucumber and lemon in the ice water which I liked as well.\n\nAshley was so patient, so attentive and did every single thing asked of her perfectly.\n\nFor a $25 bill I tipped Ashley $20 and left her a thank you note.  She earned it.\n\nSo we came back a second time just before we hit the road to leave Scottsdale and come back to LA.  This time we had an older lady with short hair who was also amazing.  The waitstaff here really cares about the restaurant and really cares about their jobs.  Once again my food was cooked perfectly.  This time the partner tried an omelette and it was seriously GINORMOUS.  For $10, he got an enormous omelette (which I'm pretty sure contained an ENTIRE avocado) and biscuits & gravy.  What a good deal.\n\nAnytime in the future I come back through the Phoenix metro, I'm probably going to make it a point to go out of my way to eat here.\n\nLike I said, I've never given a 5-star review before, but Ranch House TOTES earned it.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 5}}, {"text": "I've lived within walking distance for almost seven years but yesterday morning was my first visit to the Ranch House.

That time I grabbed a quick Rotisserie Chicken Plate, dark meat (my favorite), with sides of Rotisserie Chicken Noodle Soup (unlimited refills but I didn't have time to partake of that), cornbread, broccoli (gotta get my veggies in when possible), and sweet potatoes casserole.  Other than being a little salty, which concerns me for health reasons, and the casserole being pretty sweet, everything was delicious and I wished I hadn't had to rush thru it but didn't want to eat popcorn on an empty stomach.  It made mighty fine leftovers the next day, too.\n\nI attempted to go back a week later to try the Turkey Plate but discovered after I parked that I had worn the wrong shorts with my money and cards in the other pair back at the motel.  By the time I drove back there it was too late for the movie so I just ate near my motel and called it a night.  \n\nLast night I made sure I was properly financed and headed over to this Boston Market again.  As soon as I walked in I was  enveloped in wonderful aromas that made my mouth water.  I ordered the Turkey Plate with cornbread, creamed spinach and mashed potatoes for about $8 including tax.  Now, I'm a dark meat fan, but that turkey breast was so moist and tender and flavorful I was an instant fan.  I could cut it with a fork, no knife needed.  The only problem was for whatever reason, it wasn't hot, just sort of tepid, even borderline cool in spots.  Because I was hungry and headed for another movie across the street I didn't say anything because it tasted so good.  The spinach and mashed potatoes were hot, just not the meat.  \n\nLater in the meal a worker walked by and asked how everything was so I politely let her know the everything was delicious accept the meat wasn't hot when served to me.  A man who may have been a manager overheard me and insisted on bringing me a fresh serving of turkey even tho I told him it wasn't necessary.  I ate most of it there because it was even better warm, and added the rest to my leftovers for lunch today.  Needless to say I was highly impressed with this level of customer service.\n\nThe only other issue I had was when I first sat down I found the chair to be quite loose and wiggly so I switched to the chair next to it.  When the same man mentioned earlier walked by I mentioned to him about the chair.  He tested it, agreed it was not acceptable, and immediately removed it from service, thanking me for letting him know.

A French toast sandwich with bananas, Nutella and bacon. This was very tasty and very rich in flavor a salty, sweet. Masterpiece. Harry's Berries, waffles with this delightful mix of Berries on the top, the waffle was light and was not too filling. Lemon poppy seed pancakes also with a fruit medley on top and a fruit compote drizzled over the top. Light and flavorful mix, the lemon not too overpowering. Chicken in a waffle, chicken fried chicken inside a waffle sandwich covered in chicken gravy. Chicken was moist, and the waffle light and airy. The gravy on top was definitely home made and filled with flavor. Smoked salmon omelet. This omelet has pieces of salmon and cream cheese soaked into the middle. Eggs were fluffy and the smokey flavor of the salmon with the combination of the cream cheese was like lochs and cream cheese in an egg dish. Amazing. What is a meal without desert. Yes we had desert, recommended by one of the owners. Forgive me for forgetting his name. We had Mini Donuts and Fried Apple Ring. The donuts were coated in powdered sugar and drizzled in honey grown over the hump in Pahrump. Very tasty, but over powered by the fact we still had the fried apple rings. These fried apple rings were awesome. A cut Granny Smith deep fried and served with a cinnamon sugar sauce that we could not get enough of.\n  We will be back to this new Gem of downtown.

Why can't I leave a -1 Star review???\n\nNew Years Day 2014.  My uncle and I sat at the bar as we didn't feel like waiting for a table.  Our waiter promptly brought us our drinks after sitting (coffee).  After that, everything went downhill fast.\n\nWe both ordered the $14 MTO breakfast.  We waited 20 minutes for our breakfast.  Sitting next to the open air kitchen, we watched at least 6 party's seated after us receive their food before us.  Every single server there works with blinder's on, so don't expect refills on drinks and the like from anyone other than your server.  All servers there avoid eye contact and all of them walked past our empty coffee cups we intentionally placed at the edge of the bar.  It was almost laughable as servers prepared their drink trays next to our empty coffee cups.\n\nI ordered my 3 eggs scrambled and received 2 eggs fried hard & 1 over-easy...all 3 over-cooked.  I brought this to our waiter's attention and told him that I'd eat them anyway (didn't want to wait an additional 20 minutes for scrambled eggs).  I asked for jelly for my 4 pieces of toast and was given just 1 plastic serving.  My uncle asked for jelly and received the good stuff in a small dish (we shared).  Their hashbrowns are mushy...don't understand how that's possible.\n\nI eventually received coffee refills after throwing dirty looks at the young waitress who brags about also working at the Hard Rock steakhouse.\n\nThe manager came by towards the end of our meal and asked how everything was.  I looked him directly in the eyes and replied \"awful\".  He turned his back to me and walked away with no reply.\n\n*Note to locals*  If your considering the MTO special for breakfast here, you'll fair much better at Wildfire with the \"Gambler's Special\" without paying 7x the price (seriously...the Gambler's Special is only $1.99, $2.99 with choice of meat).  The difference (besides the outrageously higher price) is the couple pieces of fruit on a toothpick.  Further, the food and service are much better at Wildfire.\n\nSitting directly across from the kitchen, we did get a good look at other dishes offered and they looked delicious (especially the wraps).

A sprinkling of greens on top and a few slices of tomatoes. I'm not sure if the eggs were made in butter but they were suspiciously tasty. Good textures and flavors. Fresh. The MTO breakfast is basically a classic breakfast plate made with eggs, hash browns (with mashed potatoes inside), and a selection of meats from bacon, sausage, spam, to turkey bacon. Both plates were enough food for anyone. Just enough I'd say.\n\nI also sampled a bit of the poppy seed pancakes topped with blueberries. The pancakes themselves were fine. Nothing special.

Pretty busy little place at lunch time with the downtown business crowd.  Anyhow, there food is solid but overpriced. Nothing exceptional but nothing bad that I have had either. I had the salmon burger yesterday. The shoestring french fries were good, I am pretty sure they are fresh and that was probably my favorite part.  The salmon burger itself, which was recommended by the waitress, was extremely dry. I was hesitant to try it as they stated it was not a piece of salmon . I surmised it was salmon flakes with filler aka what I would expect from the frozen section at any grocery store. So going back to the dry salmon patty, the salmon burger had cream cheese - which again I am not a big fan of but I think the cream cheese and the copious amounts of mayonnaise helped offset the dryness of the salmon patty.  The menu stated that the salmon burger had a balsamic aioli, however I could not taste that at all on the burger and there did not appear to be any balsamic dressing on the burger.  I did like the bread and butter chips on top of the burger (there were five held on top with a toothpick).  My total for the salmon burger & fries, with no drink including a $2 tip was $15. I just don't see going back for the price that they charge. \n\nI overhead another waiter saying that the hangover burger was great, and my friend who got the hangover burger liked it but I just can't justify paying $13 for a burger unless I was at BURGR or the like.

Again I remember it being okay but nothing really noteworthy. I split it with a friend and it is definitely not big enough for splitting. \n\nAs a side note, they serve beer for $5, there were some good choices Dogfish Head 60 - although they also had PBR, I question who would really pay $5 for PBR - although a friend pointed out he noted a resurgence of \"cheap\" beer as being trendy - I haven't noticed that but I pay more attention to micro brews and wine myself.  But MTO seems to attempt to appeal to a sense of nostalgia by referencing wonder bread and Velveeta amongst other items, so maybe that is their justification for $5 for PBR?

Tender chunks of breaded chicken smothered in a country gravy were sandwiched between light and crispy waffles and topped with fresh berries. The dish had everything you could want -- savory proteins accompanied by the sweetness of the fruit, the airiness of the waffles and the combination of tender, crispy, crunchy textures. The mound of skinny fries that came with it weren't bad either.\n\nOn a somewhat lighter and healthier side was the vegan carrot and coconut pancakes ($11). Don't let the vegan label scare you. The light and fluffy texture make them as good as most pancakes out there.\n\nThe biggest, and maybe the only, low point of the meal was the Fat Elvis ($13). It's French toast with banana, bacon, peanut butter, strawberries, and nutella. Sounds like a mouthful, right? It was and not in a good way.

MTO has both! Together! Fried potatoes and eggs WITH ARUGULA! Pancakes WITH FRESH BERRIES! Montague, meet Capulet.  \n\nBut then the plates arrive, several times in a row now, and there they are. Three desperate slices of roma tomato that have no earthly reason for existing. Three pale pink, dry, mealy, insipid round disks that make a mockery of the whole \"fresh ingredients\" concept. It's a larger and more generally disturbing societal trend, this habituated tastelessness, but it's particularly glaring at a place that hangs its hat on the notion of seasonality. A tomato, say it with me once again, is a privilege. It grows for a few months in the summer, arrives in our kitchens bursting with the juice of sun beams, and merely asks to be sliced thick and dressed with some sea salt and cracked pepper and a drizzle of olive oil. Torn fresh basil if you have it. When you taste it you taste the earth and the sky while nymphs play the fiddle and dance. It is a near-sacred experience that we get to enjoy for a short time each summer, and then we pack away our longings until next year. We accept a life without tomatoes for the better part of the year. We ignore those crunchy, gassed-up grocery store imitations from Mexico. We hold out, we say \"no,\" because we understand that proper tomatoes are worth the wait.  \n\nThe existence of the pale, crunchy roma tomato is our collective failure as a consuming public. We should be better than this. We should all think we deserve better, because we do. The MTO kitchen staff can't fully be blamed for this sad culinary ritual, because apparently we have all of us simultaneously fallen asleep at the tomato wheel. But a restaurant that prides itself on fresh ingredients and seasonality should have a finer sense of what counts as fresh, and what doesn't, and if these pale pink impostors can sneak under the kitchen's radar then one's confidence is a little shaken. Don't settle for what your customers settle for, MTO. Not everything is fresh all the time. I'd happily settle for roasted red peppers, or pretty much anything pickled. Or simply nothing at all, which would be better than negative-tomato.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I have mixed feelings about MTO.\n\nThe first time I came here with my husband and my Dad.

The eggs were cooked perfect, the bacon is great and the toast was great as well. My husband ordered the chicken and waffles and said it was also exceptional. My Dad ordered the \"Hangover\" burger and said that while it was really good, it was a little undercooked for his taste and he didn't like the sweet pickles on top.\nOverall, we were really excited to come back!\n\nThe second time we came here was disappointing....\nI came here again with my Husband and my Brother in Law. \nI ordered a Coffee, orange juice, and the mini donuts to share. \nFirst of all the waitress forgot one of our coffees and water, no big deal it just took her a while. When I received my orange juice it had a *thick coarse black hair in it!*\nI told the waitress and decided I didn't want OJ after that. She barely said sorry...The mini donuts I received were more like mini dough cakes. They were very dense and not really donut like at all, they were smothered in honey and that didn't even help with the incredibly bland flavor, I dunked them in my coffee and that made them edible. Even tasty. Not sure if they come like this every time though, I would hope not.\n\nMy husband and I also split the Chicken and waffles, this time my hubby and I noted that while it was still pretty good, the gravy on the chicken was extremely bland this time around. \nMy Brother in Law ordered the Bacon Dippers and the Fried Apple rings. He said the Bacon Dippers were awesome. But the Fried Apple Rings were cut extremely thick, they were fried in batter but the apples were so thick they didn't really cook at all and the batter just fell off, he took one bite and didn't want the rest. Again, not sure if they are always cut SO thick. It's like eating a sliced apple...not what he was expecting. \n\nAtmosphere is super nice here, it's so nice to sit by the window and have a nice view.

Couple days later I did get a call from corporate regarding the drink, and they were only concerned if I was making a claim against BM for the damages. I said no, I cleaned it up myself, I was only making a comment as they might have an issue with their cups.  But I did take a moment to comment about the meal, and was advised I'd get a follow up call.   That was several days ago.

Over the years I saw the quality fade and the flavors go south.

I was happy that she helped guide me through side selections so I could get a side salad and fresh steamed veggies with The Half Chicken Special.\n\nAfter ordering I noticed that the drink and condiment station was well stocked and clean, as was the dining room. I found a table and within seconds my meal was brought to me by the same friendly cashier. \n\nThe meal was Hot and smelled delicious, The steamed veggies were cooked perfect and on the same quality level as most high end restaurants in this town. The side Caesar salad was fresh and yummy and at no extra cost! WOW! The Star of the night though was the perfectly cooked and seasoned chicken. I was so impressed with the plates and utensils because the were real. No plastic and paper, that was a nice touch.\n\nPlaces like this have teams of executives that work hard to make sure there unit teams perform and execute meals and guest satisfaction like I had last night.
