Though my lunch mate said the same for the baba gonoush- smooth and not chunky was the exact description. \n\nThe first plate was the Sujuk, the spicy beef sausage, that along with the fresh onions, was soaking in a beef sauce that tasted and smelled divine. An example of the quality was that the rice could have been a dish in itself. Occasionally rice is an afterthought on some plates, but here there is no lack of being cooked perfectly and tasting freshly of herbs. \n\nThe other plate we had was the Kibbi, huge ground meatballs filled with pine nuts and cracked wheat.

And trust me on this one... as an example, if you're looking for a delicious chicken shish kaboob, at an incredibly reasonable price, then you will definitely be impressed and satisfied here. The chicken is well seasoned, and has a great grilled flavor. Somehow, they impart that charcoal grilled flavor, while using what I believe is a gas grill. For about $14, you get three large skewers of really big chicken chunks, along with sweet grilled onions, red bell peppers and large whole mushrooms. Add a great bed of flavorful browned rice, plus added veggies, and you have enough food for two. And not only is the entree serving super generous, it was as good as that kabob I photographed for my review at Panini Cafe.\n\nWithout knowing how huge the servings were at Hedary's, we ordered the Mezza, which is twelve dishes of vegetarian appetizer items; ($24). It's enough to easily feed two, if not three or four, (including falafel, stuffed grape leaves, hummus, prep'd yogurt, various veggies pickled and prepared, and more).

Shish kabob was soft and juicy. Kibbi was lovely with the textural crunch of the pinenuts. Sujuk wasnt what I thought it was gonna be (I know it to be spicy dried sausage). It was good though and had some nice spices....I think it had cumin in it. Kafta was good, but it needed a sauce to elevate it...maybe if they serve a little yogurt for this and the kibbi it would be even better. The mqaniq was very interesting. The BF explained that it taste how Jungle Zone (they sell incense) smells. It kinda does....has this flowery kind of spice blend that I have no clue what it is.

Good quality feta cheese and good quality olives.  A solid 4.  I think I could have just eaten the cheese and olives with the bread they bring.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot about the pita bread.  It comes out pipping hot like it was just baked-which it might have been.  Some of the better pita bread I've ever had.  Never had it this hot before.  Was absolutely a perfect compliment to the cheese.  The falafil was a little disappointing.  I felt the falafils were too dense.  I love falafils but feel a successful falafil is light with a lot of taste.  A 2 that I wouldn't order and am glad I didn't get the plate.\n\nOur three entrees were the Greek salad, the chicken kabob, the stuffed grape leaves and the tilapia.  The salad wasn't bad-pretty typical scoring a 3.  The tilapia was cooked perfectly but could have used more seasoning though with enough lemon squeezed on top came out pretty well, a 3.5.  The chicken kabob was excellent.  I think the best dish we ordered, a solid 4.  And my dish was the grape leaves which I adore.  They came with a lot of meat inside.  I wasn't expecting so much meat (ground beef I'm sure) and in fact this is was the most meat I've ever had served in my grape leaves.  They weren't bad but I think the vegetarian version of this dish would have tasted better.  A 3.5.  \n\nAnd I got the tamarind drink which was great.  Ordered a 2nd one.

It was a fresh taste, but it needed some oomph from some hot sauce. Good but not the best felafel in town. Their sandwiches come with fries and it was okay.

One of my colleagues got the baba ganoosh as his side, and he shared with us.  I liked it more than the hummus, and I liked the radish and pickles served with both the humus and the baba ganoosh, nice touch and tasty.  The pita was totally awesome, fresh, hot, and puffed with air.  It was fun to deflate, tear, and eat with the dips.  Yummy.\n\nI got the lentil soup as my side dish, and enjoyed it quite a bit.

Nice portion, neither so little that you felt you needed more, nor so big it made you too full for your meal.\n\nBy this point, I was pleased with my meal, and the service BTW was great, very friendly and helpful without hovering.  But, when the main course came things really started to shine.  I got the kafta, and it was absolutely flawless.  Perfectly spiced, moist and flavorful.  It was two kebabs on a bed of rice pilaf which itself was also perhaps the best I have ever had - buttery yet light, and complimented the beef, onions, and tomato nicely.

I cleaned my plate, and was satisfied but not stuffed.\n\nSince I had a little room left, we ordered baklava for the three of us, and it was terrific.

Got me thinking that if we as a culture scrapped the whole bread and butter deal at nice dine in restaurants and replaced it with flat bread and yogurt for dipping we'd go a long way in improving overall health.

Straight to the table and the flames die down the cheese is absolutely amazing. Definitely grab some bread, hack off a hunk of cooling cheese and one of the grilled mint leaves and you'll have one of the most amazing melds of flavors you wouldnt believe would go together. Toward the end the cheese tends to harden up but not to the point where it hurts to chew but still tastes damn good.\n\nRoast Leg of Lamb\n- To be honest the lamb shank didnt meet my expectations at all. For some reason i keep expecting lamb to tastes like...well...lamb. That gamey taste that people tend to hate i love because it's different and in lamb, at least to me, that's that makes it lamb. Now the shank was roasted to perfection as advertised. No trouble at all getting chunks of meet to fall right off the bone. What i got was a pretty small shank, at least in my opinion it was. The sauce that went was more on the sweet side then i would have liked. Everything else was pretty good. I just gotta stop ordering Lamb shanks thinking they're going to taste like lamb chops. \n\nKibbi\n- Okay i THINK this is the dish. Wasnt mine but i was offered some and i should have got this instead of the lamb shank.

I was a little worried about how empty the restaurant was when we walked in.

Due to that, my water glass was never empty and the endless baskets of bread kept coming. The tables were also well manicured. I am anal when it comes to clearing away dirty dishes and removing scraps from the table. The girls did a great job with keeping us spotless.\n\nThe food comes in ridiculous portions. I noticed the prices were steeper than at other Mediterranean places. After ordering, I could see why. These portions are nuts. The $33 mezzo sampler can easily feed four people. In fact, it did. If I had came with just one other person, we would not have been able to dent it. All of their dips use a generous amount of garlic. I had fire breathe by the end of the meal. I was impressed. Definitely not a date type of place. I had sneaked a few bites from everyone else and the food is solid. I would not order the lentil soup again though.

Well, when we were wondering if they forgot about us, we could hear who we assume is the chef yelling about Shwarma...uh oh! Not too much longer and we finally got our food. My sandwich was huge with a giant side of fries. I was pleasantly surprised how good it was, it was so big I was able to share it with my husband who showed up late. Another friend ordered Lebni which I had never had before, if I was ever to go for Mediterranean again I would order this to share, or just to snack on with drinks.\nSo this venture hasn't swayed me onto the Mediterranean fan boat.

He and Nicole B. will be married in a few months.  None of us had eaten here and the whole menu sounded good.  We started with hummus not sure what else we would get, and the hot pita was amazing with it.  These combo platters stood out so as a table of 4 we all agreed to share 2 of them, and Nicole B. also ordered the cheese fyatir bread with mushrooms and za'atar, similar to a pizza.\n\nI was drawn to the mezze, a chef's choice sampler of 12 appetizers and salads.  Ours came with...\n1) hummus (so we got doubles!)\n2) baba ganoush\n3) feta cheese and olives with slices of tomato and cucumber\n4) Stuffed grape leaves\n5) Labni Matoom (yogurt-cheese with mint)\n6) falafel\n7) loubleh - green beans with tomato, onion, garlic\n8) majadra: lentils\n9) Greek salad\n10) fattoush\n11) tabbouleh\n12) khyar bil-laban: cucumbers in yogurt mint sauce\n\nEric R. was drawn to the meat combo (our server's favorite dish) which consisted of rice, tomatoes, and...\n1) beef shish kabob\n2) kafta: ground sirloin with onion, parsley, spices\n3) Mqaniq - pork sausage (only Eric R. ate this)\n4) sujuk - beef and jalapeno sausage\n5) kibbi - ground sirloin with bulgur stuffed with onions and pine nuts\n\nThis was a huge amount of food, plenty to share - maybe could have been enough for 6?!  The stand outs for me in the mezze were the Bulgarian feta chunks (yum), the labni matoom, and the tabbouleh.  From the meat combo, I only tried the sujuk and the kibbi because the guys at the table were carnivorous and had the plate in front of them, but I loved both the sujuk and the kibbi!\n\nWhat I like about the menu is that if you want a salad, you can pick any salad and add protein to it (lamb, beef, gyro, chicken, salmon, or shrimp).  Eric R. is interested in coming back for the meat-filled dolmas but I make them at home so he is already well fed by me!  I want to come back for lunch because lunch specials include a smaller portion of an entree but come with a choice to fattoush, tabbouli, hummus, baba ganoush or soup on the side.  Service was great and the chef even came out to chat with us after the meal to see what we thought.  He told us all of the sausages are made in house.\n\nSide note: the women's bathroom is really interesting.

Adding to the table was an excellant dip baba ganoosh with this crazy tasty pita bread that looked like it had been put on steroids. Frarej ..oh yes!! This was an Amazing roasted chicken . I mean over the top. Yum.. the shish kebab combo a skewer of satisfaction.  Yep had that as well! It was shrimp & lamb (not both on the same skewer)\nServed on a bed of seasoned rice similar to a pilaf. Again it was excellent.  HALF TIME . Great chance to take an eating break and we moved towards the liqueors. Michael introduced us to a Lebanese grape liqueor that is slow fermented through a 5 step process and a hint of aniseed is added. Somewhat similar to sweet ouzo . I liked that alot, probably to much :) Arak fakar. Ask for that for sure!  Honestly. I don't eat or drink this much but with the world cup soccer match so exciting and the chef was from Costa Rica how on earth could we leave when the match went into extra time. Better try the Lebanese coffee.. Really powerful but subtle.\nThe soccer match was now going to a penalty kick shoot off. Perfect time for desert!  We tried two of them ( just in case) we started with shabiet, a light cream custard baked in a filo pastry and paieed it with the white sangria Wasn't a huge fan of the shabiet,however our contingency plan worked well as the baklava. Layers of filo pastry pistachio nuts and a sweet butter. Oh yes!. I couldn't resist another coffee . The check.
