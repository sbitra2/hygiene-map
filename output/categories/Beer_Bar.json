Saw that there were many on Main Street so we decided to just cruise down and see what looked interesting. So glad that we did. If you're looking for a cozy classic pub with an awesome beer list AND tasty basic food this is the place.  Place was pretty full with what looked like local regulars and even though we were out of towners, we felt right at home and welcome. Even though the menu said order drinks and food at the bar our server came to our table was super friendly and made us feel right at home. I ordered a bowl of Gumbo and hand battered cheese curds - hubby order the Big Eddy burger. Lunch with drinks came to a whopping $18 and was super. Would definitely go back next time we're driving through Sun Prairie.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Excellent burgers, great beer selection.
