The lobby does not seem to get too noisy as it is small, so I suppose it is not really an issue unless you have a disgruntled hotel employee.\n\nAnother interesting logistical note is that they do not really advertise their valet parking, so you might drive right by it.  I am not sure how far you would walk if you decided to self park.  Since this is Vegas, valet charge is only a tip anyways, so unless you don't want someone driving your Bentley, then you should be okay.\n\nDue to the recession or that it's location is pretty secluded, this place does not seem like it is too busy.

There is nothing quite like sipping some tea, nibbling on some treats while contemplating the vicissitudes of life with friends. This is the ultimate luxury on a lazy afternoon.\n\nI have to say, I'm a little disappointed in the reservation system they have here at the Tea Lounge. For a reservation for 8 - it took 2 days to hear back from reservations for the tea lounge in addition to requiring a faxed form with my signature and credit card. I think the faxed form was a little excessive given that we've reserved more expensive meals in the past without this requirement (just a credit card number over the phone was sufficient).\n\nEnough griping - onto the afternoon tea experience. \n\nService was excellent - warm, efficient but not too overwhelming.\n\nOur table was set for us and our seats consisted of a long couch and some cushioned chairs. This arrangement was a little uncomfortable due to the height of the table. For those sitting on the couch, the table was a little too high while being too low for those in chairs.\n\nWe all ordered the afternoon tea set which cost $40. This is basically an all can eat affair - so feel free to indulge.\n\nWhen the tea arrived, I was disappointed that I couldn't see the herbal leaves in the transparent pot. That's kind of a no-no when it comes to a nice cup of tea. Overall, I felt the herbal tea could have steeped a little longer. It was nice that the pots had a small burner underneath to keep the tea warm though.\n\nThe sandwiches were hit or miss. There was a ham sandwich, a curry chicken sandwich and a smoked salmon sandwich. While the ham and salmon were alright, the curry chicken salad sandwich was full of flavour.\n\nThe scones came fresh from the oven and piping hot - as they ought to be. Texturally, they were a little on the dry side for my tastes. However this can be easily overlooked with the addition of devonshire cream and lovely preserves (the fig jam is outstanding). If you want more, you'll have to let your server know in advance because they have to bake them fresh from the oven each time.\n\nFinally, the sweets. The chocolate cake was luxurious without being too sweet. The berry tart painted with a golden glaze was a nice light touch to the end of the meal. The madelines were lovely and the chocolates divine.\n\nIf you've never experienced high tea before, then you're certainly in for a treat. If you already love high tea, this place may be a bit of a disappointment if you take into account how they make their tea, their seating arrangements and the hassle to book the lounge if you're in a large group. 3.5 starred review.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 4, "cool": 4}}, {"text": "Great view, tasty food, bad service, mediocre tea.

This species of restaurant is dying because of the change in taste from old school dishes to more modern fare.  Don't sigh and scroll down just yet; despite the mixed reviews, there is something to read here about the Carmel Room.\n\nFirst, the fact that it's in the JW Marriott in Summerlin is honestly surprising, given the fact that this restaurant belongs in a shabby shopping strip near hotel row.  Carmel room is unexpected, a somewhat hidden gem basked by the glow of slot machines and paved with tacky carpet.  Once you enter the doors of the restaurant, you notice the private table seating and the old school restaurant layout.  From fourteen glasses laid out for every drink made by man at each table setting, to the waiters in the old school black and white uniforms, it's really entertaining.  Their menu is just as classic, with seared scallops served on the shell to fish over creamed spinach.  What I am a sucker for is escargot, and they have it--with a twist. \n\nAlthough their old school food is passe, they do try to make it a bit modern to up the ante.  For example, their escargot appetizer is shelled escargot topped with little discs of buttery puffed pastry instead of a side basket of french bread.  Their scallops are seared perfectly and served on the shell, and if you order the steak, it's all on it's own on a hot plate with the sides in those cute carafes.\n\nOverall, the meal is nice, the food is a kick back to the old days, and their location is interesting.  I liked my first experience here, and I would honestly go there again just to show a friend or two this place.  However, the food itself, although done right, wasn't enough for me to return as a regular like I do at other old school stops in Vegas.\n\nDon't listen to me--find out for yourself.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Las Vegas offers the hungry carnivore a plethora of options from bargain steaks to chains like Ruth's Chris, not to mention the \"fine dining\" options, so it's not a matter of eating a steak meal that is the challenge, but finding the restaurant that suits your tastes and expectations.  I am neither a steak novice nor a steak snob - I simply believe a good steak is a good steak and the restaurant's d\u00e9cor/name has never influenced my taste buds.  \n\nFrom the moment we were greeted by the host to the banana foster dessert (made in front of us, flames and all), everything was good.  By the way, there were 3 types of bread in the bread basket - our favorite was the white chocolate macadamia bread.  Yep, warm white chocolate macadamia bread.\n\nWe ordered the Beef Wellington, Prime Rib (16oz), mashed potatoes, and the asparagus with hollandaise.  The Wellington was perfect - crisp flaky pastry on the outside and juicy steak baked inside - it's what you would expect.  The prime rib was advertised as 16oz but my expert eye (and stomach) says that it was at least 24oz - I could barely eat half of that beautiful slab of meat.  The prime rib was trimmed perfectly - cut by somebody who obviously knows meat - and cooked by a wizard.  The piece of meat had perfect marbling without having chunks of fat that needed trimming - no more than 3oz of fat trimmed off of a 24oz steak...amazing.\n\nThey do have a nice wine list, but we weren't in the wine mood; however, we did have the crab cake (1 per order).  Upon the first bites of the appetizer, the conversation went something like this:\nMe: \"Hey, where's the usual bread crumb and celery filler?\"\nWife: \"Oh my gosh - it's practically all crab!\"\nThe crab cake was definitely a pleaser, and one of the best I've had.  Just to offer a comparison, my wife ordered the crab cakes at Serendipity 3 (Caesars), and it was just plain fishy and gross.  \n\nI went to dinner in jeans and a nice button up shirt, though my wife was dressed up for dinner.  Unlike some of the pretentious restaurants on the Strip with their hoity-toity dress codes, the staff at The Carmel Room treated me like a valued customer despite my casual appearance.  \n\nIf you are looking for a nice cut of meat cooked perfectly to your request, then you really can't go wrong with The Carmel Room at the JW Marriott/Rampart Casino.  YMMV but the experience exceeded my expectations in every way, and I'm the type of diner that goes in half expecting the worst to prevent disappointment.

It was cooked perfectly medium rare, at least. Then he tried the bearnaise sauce, and declared it to be scrambled eggs.  I had noticed it was rather orange and lumpy looking, so I wasn't surprised.  The waiter took it away, saying it would be removed from the bill (along with making a nasty face at my hubby while forgetting that I could still see his face).  \n\nHubby also said the peppercorn sauce was odd tasting, like it has some strange sweetness that didn't go well with the sauce.

The waiter was hard to understand at times and was very lax. It was like he didn't jive with the atmosphere. There was a few people near us that he spoke to as if he knew them as usuals and seemed to have a different attitude with them than with us. \nThe food was good, but very overpriced. For the same prices, I know of much better places to eat. My hubby had the lobster bisque and porterhouse. They were good, but I have had better for the same or lower price.

I had the bibb salad which did have very good dressing on it, but seemed very small. I had the stuffed shrimp for the entree. The shrimp/stuffing was delish, but the angel hair pasta was kind of gummy and soaked up the sauce. Wonder if it sat too long while the steak was cooked...\nThe desert was just ok.

It was a very nice restaurant to sit back and enjoy a great dinner.  My only thing I would rate on the negative side was the sound level.  It was nice and quiet for the most part until the lounge act went on at a neighboring bar.  When they got on, it got really loud with bar band music.  It wasn't horrible, but I could have done without it in a steakhouse setting. \n\nFor dinner, we had crab cakes for an appetizer, 16oz boneless rib eyes with saut\u00e9ed wild mushrooms and herb butter, truffle mac n' cheese, garlic mashed potatoes, and we finished it off with a Grand Marnier souffl\u00e9. Everything was fantastic!  The crab cakes were full of big hunks of crab and served with a very tasty sauce.   Both of the steaks (we are boring and ordered the same thing) were super tender, and melt in your mouth tasty.  The mushrooms were cooked perfectly and really added to the steak.  The herb butter bumped up the flavor another notch or 2 as well.  These were some great steaks!  The truffle mac n' cheese was good.  Not the best I have had, but pretty yummy.  The garlic mashed potatoes were very smooth and creamy.  I do wish the serving size was bigger though because I love mashed potatoes almost as much as love my kid!  I also ordered a side of B\u00e9arnaise because it is AWESOME.  The B\u00e9arnaise here has to be one of the better sauces I have had at any steakhouse in recent memory.   Oh, and the souffl\u00e9! The souffl\u00e9 was absolutely delectable!  The souffl\u00e9 was so light and fluffy!  Then the sauces made it even more fabulous.

I recently found out I couldn't eat gluten anymore, and thought I would never eat scones again. Casa Angelina make gluten free scones every morning.\n\nLocated on London road, an elegant road next to Broughton street, one immediately sees a display of beautiful cakes in the basement window. It's enticing. \n\nMy boyfriend and I enter, and are overwhelmed by an incredible selection: oreo cheesecake, fruit cheesecakes, scones, carrot cake, cheese scones, polenta cake, cupcakes, bundt cakes, cookies, biscotti, and much more! I was told that the orange and polenta cake, the banana cupcakes, the banana loaf cake (with buttercream icing) and the scones were GF.  We opt for a pot of the eteaket rooibos for two, my other half opts for the dense looking carrot cake, I of course get the GF scone.\n\nWe sit at the back, at a table near the window, with a view out onto the back garden/yard. The room was very cosy, mixing vintage style with modern comfort. Wooden floor panels, a lot of contrast between black and white, really comfortable seats. When we arrived it was empty, but at 4pm it suddenly became full of people after afternoon teas. A feature I loved was the dedication to the owner's grandmother, or 'nonna', above the fireplace. Apparently she was born and raised in Brindisi, in Puglia, Italy, and made the best food for miles around. This little tearoom has been dedicated to her, and I really hope it does well. The owner is clearly a dedicated baker, friendly, but at the same time not invasive in the slightest.\n\nOur tea and food arrived, served in antique cups and plates, as one would expect from such a quirky little place in Edinburgh. My scone came served with two massive jars of jam, raspberry and blackberry, a pot of butter, and a really generous pot of clotted cream. I cut it in half, and it survived the test. It didn't crumble or fall apart like some GF products, and i really couldn't notice the lack of wheat flour. Robbie's carrot cake looked amazing. It was again, a very generous slice, plump with fruit and topped with a lot of cream cheese frosting. Both of us agreed that it was delicious. \n\nWe spent about two hours here reading and occasionally chatting, and didn't feel the least bit of pressure to leave.\n\nThe scone cost \u00a32.25, the tea for two \u00a33.20, the carrot cake \u00a32.90. Not bad, comparing it to other places. You can also take away the scones for \u00a31.80. I actually took a GF banana cupcake away, as this is a little far from home and I don't know when I will be back next. There's a loyalty card scheme, for every 5 drinks/cakes you buy, you get the 6th free.\n\nOn offer are also amazing looking afternoon teas, with some more unusual offerings such as feta and spinach parcels as alternatives to finger sandwiches. I have been told they also do a gluten free afternoon tea!\n\nEdit: Now 31st April, the day after the cream tea. I just ate the banana cupcake. Lovely fluffy texture to the cake, which was surprising considering it was gluten free & contained banana. Usually both of these add up to=dense, fudge-like consistency. I'm impressed. The buttercream was laid on REALLY thick and I had a bit of trouble finishing it, despite it being delicious. I think that's because they sneaked some coffee into it, making it quite rich.

Marie Claire, the owner, listed all the options - poor lass, she rhymed them all off to get a response of 'do you have the scones?' and I breathed a sigh of relief when she confirmed that, yes, there were GF scones.\n\nThere were so many options through - at least six GF cakes and I actually felt bad for not being able to sample more - lemon drizzle, millionaires shortcakes, pistachio, courgette (they use a lot of veggies in cakes so cake here is essentially one of your five a day), banana and walnut cupcakes, apple, and more. As we were positioned with tea on one side and cake on another two then it was cake porn heaven. In the interests of research I will return to sample more varieties but this time it was for a cuppa, scone (with jam and clotted cream) and a shared piece of millionaires shortcake (couldn't resist).\n\nI did wonder if the scone would be over done but it was lovely and held together perfectly with the clotted cream and raspberry jam. The millionaires shortcake was lovely - firm, not too hard, but not disintegrating into crumbs with a coconutty based biscuit, nice thick layer of caramel (I hate a skimpy layer!) and a good wedge of chocolate. It was delicious and very rich but having an almighty sweet tooth, I kept eating little bits and was disappointed when the little bits disappeared one by one. Tea is by Eteaket and there are lots of varieties but the breakfast tea was lovely and our pot was topped up with hot water for extra cups. \n\nAlthough it's new, Casa Angelina is already on the Edinburgh hot list I would say. At 3pm on a Saturday (without a booking), we grabbed the last free table and some visitors were left disappointed by not sitting in, though did purchase consolation take away cakes. The vintage tearoom is small (decor is lots of creams and pastel colours) but very cute with vintage style chairs, chaise longue and in a lovely sunny backroom (even though Casa Angelina is at basement level, its not dark and pokey). It is worth booking in advance to avoid disappointment and I plan to go back shortly to sample the gluten free afternoon tea.

I walked past many tasty looking cafes to get here, so had high hopes that it would be top notch.\n\nInside, it's all dark wood, rickety furniture and it has charm. It was busy, so it must be popular. The menu wasn't hugely extensive and felt like it hadn't been updated in a good 5 years or so. This isn't necesarily a bad thing. But when I saw the 'full breakfasts' being brought to other tables they reminded me more of traditional Scottish greasy-spoon fare than the best of the best brunch standards. So, I went for the Eggs Benedict.\n\nBrunch, espeically after a hard night partying with some of the best Yelpers in town the night before, is sacred to me. It should soothe your hungry tummy, calm your slightly sore head, and warm the cockles of your soul. The eggs benedict were nice enough but quite bland. And they weren't served with bacon, they were served with wafer-thin slices of smoked ham. A bit of a disappointment.\n\nAlso, it didn't help that we were sitting near-ish the front door, and once or twice a waitress stood holding it open when talking to customers, lettings all the freezing cold air in, and cooling down my eggs a lot. The result was one tasty egg, and one very cold egg. Humpf.\n\nThe cakes in the cake stand looked very nice. And I've heard there is a great jazz night here, which I must investigate.\n\nBut compared to other places I've eaten brunch in, this was very average. Although I must give a shout out to the waitresses who were all very friendly and efficient, and really had their eye on every table ensuring we weren't kept waiting. If it hadn't been for the cold door = cold egg scenario, maybe I would have been happier.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "During my Bruntsfield years this place was bit of a god send for recovery food.\n\nPancakes, bacon & maple syrup = winner\nNachos = obviously a winner\nMeal of the day= hot or miss but more hit than miss\n\nAdd to that a virgin mary and a pot of earl grey and I was well on way to being back in the world of the living. If I was going to criticise this place its that the staff can be a bit snippy at weekends as they are clearly run off their feet and have no space to move.\n\nThey fairly cram in the tables and if the mothers and babies brigade are in avoid at all costs!

Not wow, not bad but ok.\n\nWhat it does wow me with is the cheesecake. Specifically multiple varieties of gluten free cheesecake! No one sells gluten free cheesecake. At least no one did till I ended up at Cafe Grande whilst I was flat hunting.  Last time I had white chocolate and raspberry and it was lovely - creamy, not too overpowering and lovely scrumptious raspberries and sauce. The Banoffee Pie rocks too - lovely banana, caramelly goodness! Just don't put it in the fridge if you take it away as the base goes pretty hard (its gf biscuit base remember!). \nI love having a choice and there I've yet to try the baileys cheesecake but its on the list! \n\nService is good.

My friend and I went for the classic and we were both delighted with the result. The muffin was toasted just enough to make it crispy without spoiling the fluffiness and the eggs were wonderfully hot (although so was the plate: yowchio! Warn me next time, please, waitress... I didn't spot your gloves until too late!)\n\nBut - oh dear, Cafe Grande - there goes a star. There was no drinks menu in sight so we're still not entirely sure if a range of teas was available. The tea, once ordered, took a goodly while to arrive and we had to ask for extra sugar when it did, since there was only one sachet each. \n\nAnd - whoops - another. It's not a small place as such, but it feels a bit like they've tried to fit too many people in and so it's kind of cramped. I had to press myself in against the counter while paying so that people could get past and the lady on the till barely said a word to me and swapped over with someone else halfway through taking my payment!
