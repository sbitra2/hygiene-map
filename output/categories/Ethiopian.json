It's about a ten minute cab ride away, it's cheap and they have delicious fake meat.  Delicious.  While my dad may hate fake meat product, there is nothing the man loves more than cheap (the dude likes to be told how much you spent on his birthday present and if it's under $10 he will be all, \"HIGH FIVE!\" Once, my sister got him a pair of toe nail clippers from Mac Frugal's (RIP) for 99 cents and the man shed a tear.  HE CRIED, HE WAS SO PROUD) so we were in a cab faster than you can say, \"faux chicken chow mein.\"  Well, our cabbie was a delightful chap from Somalia who was very affable and talkative and when he asked why we were going to a vegetarian restaurant, my dad said, \"Because this one's a VEGAN!  Hahaha!' and they laughed and laughed.  Good one, you guys!  It IS hilarious when someone is vegan!  HAR DEE FUCKING HAR HAR.\n\nwe pull up to Long Life Vege and the motherfucker is closed.  GODDAMMIT.  we ask our cabbie for restaurant recommendations and he suggests Merkato since it is nearby and he is a regular.  We get to Merkato and as we are getting out of the cab, both my dad and I realize that we forgot our wallets.  Well, actually, my dad forgot his wallet and I \"forgot\" mine, you dig?  I ain't paying when money bags is around!  I wrangle dogs for a living and my father gets hundred dollar bills poured on his head just for waking up.  Plus, there will be no social security left for me when i'm old and I gotta save NOW!  and by save NOW!, i mean buy that new ipod phone because it's SWEET!  do you think it comes in pink??\n\nWe take a cab back to the hotel, my dad get his wallet, takes out another $100 from the ATM and we drive back to Merkato.  The cab is $45 at this point so my dad gives the guy what he thinks is $70 because he has put up with our insanity for the evening.  You're saying to yourself, \"Who gives a fuck, Laura?\" And to that I say, \"Wait for it. You will get a mild satisfaction at the end but it's probably still not worth reading the whole long ass review.\"\n\nWe walk into Merkato and are the only non-Ethiopian people in the place and it's crazy crowded.  Both VERY good signs for potential deliciousness.  I order the veggie combo (which was a very typical veggie combo: yellow lentils, red lentils, mustard greens, enjera salad, etc) and it was MAGNIFICENT.  One of the best i've had and I've had A LOT.  my dad got the dead lambert and said the flavor was fantastic but there was too much fat and gristle.  now, contrary to popular belief, i haven't always been vegan.  i used to eat meat and let me tell you, i liked the grossest meat.  tendons and gristle and marrow...i mean, i would CLEAN a chicken bone and then use a splinter to pick my teef.  i was a hardcore red neck of an obese 9 year-old until i figured out i was eating bambi.  ANYWAY, if you are currently like i was when i was 9 years-old, then get the lamb and when you're done, have your cholesterol checked because i'm pretty sure you're gonna drop dead at any moment.  \n\nSo, we finish our fantastic meal about 15 hours after we first walked in (that's how they roll in Ethiopia.  Slowly.  But friendly.  Like this review.) and as he's paying, my dad realizes that instead of the $30 tip he thought he left our lovable cabbie, he gave him $115 tip.  MY DAD'S BAD!  we also realized that we had no way back to the hotel. luckily when i asked our waitress to call us a cab, she was all, \"hold on\" and disappears.  two minutes later, a guy who was eating a few tables over has us in his cab, headed back to the hotel.

And there's a cab driver (Yasin!  Holla!) who is high rolling tonight.  Or, you know, sending money back to his family in his war torn country.

The waitress did apologize when I brought it to her attention.\n\n* Vegetarian Combo \"Great variety of vegetarian dishes.\" ($8.50) - This dish arrived laid out on a piece of injera, which is a large sourdough flatbread and has a bit of a spongy in texture.  It included Injera Salad, side salad, ground bean powder, yellow beans, green lentils, spinach, red lentils, and steamed cabbage and carrots.  Our favorites were the two variations of lentils, the spinach, and the yellow beans.  The bean powder one had a weird texture, similar to baby food.  Overall, everything was really good from the Vegetarian Combo and perfect enough for two to share.\n\n* Kitfo \"Ethiopian version of steak tartar, lean red chopped beef minced, blended and delicately seasoned in hot spice 'mitmita'.\" ($8) - After seeing Andrew Zimmerman's Bizarre Foods, we recalled him eating this raw beef and was definitely game to try.  We were so glad we did.  The waitress brought it to the table and placed it in the middle of the injera that was already laid out with veggies.  It had delicate hints of spice from the chili powder, and had a nice taste and texture.  It didn't seem overly meaty despite it being rare beef.  It had quite simple flavors actually.  It was a nice addition to our Vegetarian Combo and perfect enough to share.\n\nA basket of injera bread also comes along to help you eat since there are no utensils for this part of the dining.

It was regular ol' Lipton tea, but they'd added warm spices to the hot water used to steep the teabag in.\n\nWe ended up with the house kitfo ($10) and awaze lamb tibs ($8.50) based on our waitress's recommendations.

The atmosphere was relaxed and friendly.  Like quite a few other reviewers, we were the only non-Ethiopians there.  From the moment we walked through the front door, the aroma of meat and spices tantalized our noses.\n\nWe started our meal with a round of yemisir sambusa - flaky fried pastries stuffed with spiced lentils.  One is enough per person.  They're quite large.  The combination of delicate, crispy pastry and toothsome lentils was delightful.  They came with small cups of spicy sauce for dipping, as well.\n\nThe three of us each ordered an entree, with the intention of sharing, so we could try as many new things as possible.  I ordered the Yedoro Wot, which is a chicken drumstick and a whole hard-boiled egg stewed in a rich, spicy sauce.  The chicken was incredibly tender.  The egg really soaked up the flavor of the sauce, and was a surprisingly good compliment to the chicken.  \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Awaze lamb tibs.  They were so flavorful and juicy, stewed with onions and hot pepper paste; they may have been everyone's favorite dish.  \n\nMy roommate got the Special Kitfo:  seasoned raw beef mixed with cheese and spinach.

She poured all the dishes directly onto the flatbread, as a communal serving dish.  There are, of course, no utensils.  Instead, the diner tears off pieces of bread, uses the bread to pick up the meat, and eats it together.  It's a wonderful, sensual way to dine.

The food was good not GREAT!!! The portion was large which is probably the only reason I gave them 2 stars. After we finished our meal, we could have basically walked out of the restaurant, I doubt they would have noticed anyways with the way things were going. I walked up to the counter and stood in front of the cashier to pay my bill. She took her sweet time and didn't even realize I was there until one of her co-workers pointed it out to her. From here it took her about 5 minutes to hand me my bill and change. She did not even say thank you when she gave me my change. No tip was given obviously.

I've never had Ethipian food and my companion had only enjoyed once so we decided to go to the highest rated place in Vegas that was the cheapest - Merkato seemed to be a great choice.\n\nWe have been doing 30 days of vegetarianism so we decided on the pastries with lentils as an appetizer and the vegetarian combo that most people on Yelp rave about. \n\nI found it a bit strange when the vegetarian combo came out without the pastries/lentils - but figured that they would bring it out later or forgot to get it. She spooned a red chili-consistency food onto the sponge-bread plate that was the vegetarian combo. At this point I had finished my water before beginning to eat. \n\nEverything tasted good; the Injera (spongey bread) went well with everything but I found that it might have tasted better if it was warm instead of cold (not a beef with the restaurant). My companion took a bite and pulled something out of her mouth. This is where things took a turn for the worse.\n\nShe showed me a small black rock that was in the yellow food that looked like mashed corn. I thought it might be a seed, and she dropped it on her plate - making a loud chink sound. I felt it and we definitely agreed it was a rock. A rock in our food? Really? \n\nA waitress never adressed if we were doing okay; but to be fair they were busy chatting with each other ALONE at the bar instead of helping their customers. My water was empty the whole dinner and was never refilled. I had to walk to the waitresses and ask them for the check. \n\nThis is when the second strike happened.\n\nThe check read a vegetarian platter and then an $8 appetizer that we did not order. Instead of giving us the pastry, they had given us a more expensive appetizer that they had scooped on to the plate. However, there was no way we could have known this during dinner because 1.) nothing was ever explained to us what each thing was and 2.) they appetizer apparently came at the same time as the vegetarian platter (and the description of the vegetarian platter is vague on the menu). \n\nI asked if they could take some of the cost off of the appetizer - I acknowledged  that maybe there could have been more communication, but it really was a mistake on the waitresses part for taking down our order wrong. She said \"Oh no, because that's good stuff and you're taking it to-go.\" to which I responded \"I don't want to waste your food, if you want to throw it away and take some of the charge off i'm okay with that;\" She said she couldn't do anything and was completely unreceptive and unapologetic. Her view was that we should have told the waiter that we had received the wrong appetizer. \n\nMy companion told her and showed the the black rock that was found in the food. No emotion. No apology. She just said \"Oh...\" Are you kidding me? We were astounded by how terrible the service was.\n\nPoor communication takes two parties, but they really dropped the ball on this one.\nPoor waiting service because I had to get up to ask for the check and no one came to check on us - they weren't busy with anything else but conversing with each other.\nPoor kitchen - there was a rock in the food. A rock.\n\nI'm very upset. I'm very sad that I'm writing a poor review; before this my companion always joked that I always have a great time and enjoy all dining experiences. That streak is over. Thanks a lot Merkato; avoid this place at all costs just in principle of the way they treat their customers.\n\nRestaurants that care more about money than sharing an experience with their customers don't deserve to be open - there are too many passionate and loving business owners/workers that are struggling to support an operation like Merkato.", "review_stars": 1, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 8, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Great food, great experience, and just few min. cab drive from the strip!

We're definitely getting around!\n\nCottage Cafe is about a block away from the Hofbrauhaus, and like the other yelpers mentioned, pay attention when you're driving there.  It's on the right, and you'll see a sign for a Pirinha night club first, and Cottage Cafe is next door to the left of that.  However, you need to turn into the parking lot before you drive past the club, otherwise you're stuck and have to make you u-turn somewhere.  \n\nA few people hanging out when we arrived on a Friday evening for dinner.  We chose a table by the right side and noticed how much more lighting there was at this restaurant (as opposed to the other two we've been to).  There was this annoying blue light though directly across from me, it was just a tad too neon.\n\nWe have our favorites and so this is what we ordered: \n\n* Vegetarian Combination \"A combination of alicha, collared greens and lentils.\" ($9.90) - I was concerned that there would be only three items in this combo, but  not so!  They had split lentils in red sauce (good, but a bit different from what we've had), green salad, carrots and string beans, steamed cabbage and potatoes, yellow bean thing (that we really liked here, better than the other places), beets and potatoes, yogurt, and collared greens.  So, there was definitely a nice array of things to choose from.\n\n* Kitfo \"Finely chopped, USDA choice lean beef with spiced butter and mitmita - hot pepper.\" ($8.90) - When we ordered this dish, we made a point of checking with the waitress to be sure it was going to be raw beef.  And we went over it a couple of times and she assured us it was raw.  I still had my doubts because I don't think she understood us.  Well, when the dish arrived, our kitfo looked like cooked ground beef.  The Husband and I asked the waitress again if this was the kitfo, the RAW beef, and she said it was!  I was in disbelief and knew my eyes were not fooling me.  Finally, another waitress came over and asked us if we wanted the raw beef, and we said yes.  So they took it back and changed out the beef.  It didn't seem to be a problem for them, I just don't think the waitress understood us at all.  The kitfo was good, not quite as spicy or buttery as Merkato's version, but still good.\n\nIt was the perfect amount of food for two people.\n\nService was fine - the waitress refilled our glasses without asking and brought out more injera (spongy flat sourdough bread) just as she saw we were needing it.  A few other people came in to dine during our visit there.  One gentleman asked if I wanted to join his party for coffee, but I passed.  (I think he was trying to pick me up despite the fact that I was with the Husband!)     \n\n3.5 stars\n\nCash only.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 6, "cool": 4}}, {"text": "I had quite the dining experience at Cottage Cafe. Where to begin...\n\nWhen we walked in the front door, the only people in the place were the staff. They watched us as we stood there, only approaching us after we seated ourselves. Since we had never had Ethiopian food before, we asked for some recommendations. The waitress spoke so softly that I could barely hear what she was saying, but we ended up ordering drinks and three entrees: lamb, beef, and this bean dish. After we ordered, a man came in and placed a to-go order. About 20 minutes after we ordered, he got his food and left. About 15 minutes later, we finally got our food. The lamb and bean dish were very good, but the beef was not. First of all, there wasn't really any beef. We got these chunks of bone, most of which looked like sections of vertebrae, that had a few small pockets of meat buried in the gaps, but that was about it. Second, one of the sections of bone had a few ribs still attached. Normally I wouldn't mind, but considering I have seen beef bones before, I know that THESE WERE NOT FROM A COW. These ribs were small and I am convinced they were probably from a dog or a cat. When we asked the waitress about the beef, she just said, \"Yes, the meat is there.\" Odd.\n\nAfter we finished eating, the waitress didn't come to take the plates away for a good 20 minutes. After we sat there for another half hour or so, she finally brought the bill. I tend to look over restaurant bills before paying, and in this case, I thought that one of the line items was more than was listed on the menu. We asked the waitress if we could see the menu, so she obliged, but as she picked up the menu, she immediately went back into the kitchen where we could hear her arguing with the chef. She came back to our table, set the menu down, and without hesitation told us that one of the line items was mistakenly overcharged. She proceeded to correct a separate line item from the one I had noticed. I then checked each price on the bill against the prices listed in the menu and found that EVERY SINGLE ITEM WAS OVERCHARGED! I have to give them credit for not even try to be discrete about ripping us off. Anyhow, she took the bill back into the kitchen to correct it and didn't bring it back for about five minutes. It appeared she was arguing with the chef again. Maybe we were just being paranoid, but when we got the correct bill, we paid with cash. I had this feeling that paying by credit card would result in a slew of suspicious charges. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised to find out this place is a front. Meatless meat dishes and shady service aren't the traits of a restaurant that cares about customers returning. Who knows, maybe they just tried to take advantage of us since we weren't Ethiopian.

That's a bold statement! Needless to say, I had to see what the hot fuss was about.\n\nI called my order in as I know that Ethiopian joints can some times have service that is SSSSLLLLLLOOOOOWWWWW!

Two TVs in the corner with the sports channel on.  A few stragglers came in to dine and for to-go orders.  It's also pretty dark in this restaurant.\n\nWe knew we wanted something standard that we could compare our previous experience to, but we couldn't quite find these items on the menu.  We knew we wanted veggies and beef.  This is what we got:\n\n* Vegetarian Combo ($14) - Since the vegetarian items were sold a la carte, we asked if we could have a veggie combo, and they came up with one.  (I'm sure it exists, but we didn't see it on the menu.  It has six different items on it.  Our favorites were the split lentils - one in green sauce and the other in red - really tasty and we're just loving our lentils.  Then the yellow bean thing, the steamed cabbage and carrots , the collared greens, and the green salad.  Of course, it's all laid out on a piece of injera, the spongy  sourdough flatbread used to pick up your food with.  \n\n* #22. Raw Beef \"A beef served with chilies with injera.\" ($12) - We initially wanted to order #26. Kitifo Special \"Finely chopped lean beef with spiced Ethiopia butter, collard greens, homemade cottage cheese, mitmite (spiced hot chilies).\" ($11) but when the waitress asked us if we wanted it medium or well, we figured we ordered the wrong thing.  We wanted raw beef, so quickly chose #22.  The waitress was surprised that we wanted raw beef, but we were hoping that it would be similar to the raw beef we had at Merkato Ethiopian Restaurant.  Boy, were we wrong!  Out came five chunks of raw beef, and I do mean fist size pieces!  (Check the pics!)  We weren't sure if it was a joke, but the waitress placed it down before us with two knives and a bowl of hot chili paste.  The Husband just looked at me and gave it a go.  He attempted to slice off pieces of beef, but both knives were very dull and he was struggling.  It was a very sad attempt.  Even with the fork we requested, it didn't help much.  At one point I thought I could be a barbaric animal and pick up my piece of meat and give it a tear by the mouth.  Unfortunately, that didn't work either.  Eventually, we were able to finally cut through two chunks of the beef.  We ended up taking the rest home.  The meat was fresh, and the spicy chili sauce is really what makes this dish.  It was just something we definitely weren't expecting and a bit too much effort.  (When we packed the three chunks of beef home, we made sure to ask for more of that chili paste.)\n\nAt one point, we were certain another waitress could see us struggling but didn't really do anything about it.  We even asked the guy sitting at the bar if we were doing it right and he said we were doing fine.  (If only the knives were sharper!)  At the end of the meal, the guy at the bar said that most people start off with gored gored, which is cubed beef filet rolled in spices, similar to kitfo (which we know we like already).  So it was pretty impressive that we started with raw chunks of beef with no spices or marination.  \n\nService was okay. We wish the waitress told us it was chunks of solid beef because we probably would have ordered something else. She did come by with more injera before we had to ask.  But after we got our to go box, we waited awhile for our check and nothing came.  We had to remind her, although there were only a few people dining.\n\nOverall, the food is good, but the menu is limited.

I'm not going to abuse the names of the dishes, especially since we went round and round trying to get the names but running into a language roadblock at most turns. \n\nSo best items include: A ground meat dish served with what I believe is some type of cracked wheat that tastes wonderful and is full of exotic spices in a smooth polenta-like texture. Coriander, cummin, cinnamon, a little curry maybe. Very complex flavors. \n\nThe spicy chicken. I don't know what the red sauce is, but did tasted both spicy and cool at the same time. The spices sneak up on you: kind of flat at first, then they bloom in your mouth and give you spice and smokey peppers and some heat without overwhelming your tongue. Really well balanced dish. \n\nThe greens served with lamb was a nice combination as well. The lamb was cooked well mostly, though sitting on a table for a while did toughen some bites up a bit. As good as the lamb tasted, the greens stole the show. Minerally and firm, not mushy or overcooked. \n\nAnd this is all served at a languid, no-need-to-rush pace. Stick around and coffee is your reward. A nice thick concoction made in the tradition manner- by hand, no espresso machines here. No foo foo watered down cafe coffee, little c this.Strong and bold ( hint: a spoon of sugar cuts the bitterness by a lot ). Nice hospitality.

As much as I liked the injera, after a while I found my palate getting a little tired of it.   It was also lukewarm to cold, and I assumed that was how it was supposed to be but I saw another reviewer mention it should be hot?   If this is true I would have much preferred some heat to it, but I'm not aware enough to make that call.\n2.  They don't open until 1 pm.   I prefer an earlier lunch, so I found myself just counting the minutes from about 12:15 til 1 to go down there.  Personal thing, but I think it should count\n3.  I really wanted to try some meat but the majority seemed to be cooked in some type of butter.   Again this could be traditional cooking and I still loved the vegetarian platter, but I was a little bummed about not being able to try both without worrying about my lactose intolerance (shakes fist to the heavens) and my choices were overall limited. \n\nSo first time, but certainly not the last!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 4, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "This restaurant was different for me.

In the land of neon, only the lit-up word OPEN grabbed our attention.\n\nAt 8:30 on a Tuesday night, we were the only diners.  The small bar was populated by Ethiopians.  We were greeted warmly by the owner(?), and given menus, which have no appetizers, drinks, desserts, or alcoholic beverages, just the entrees.  Thirteen of them, and that's it!!  I wanted honey wine and my husband wanted an Ethiopian beer, but they were out of both of them; the shipment from California that was supposed to arrive that afternoon didn't come, so we stuck with the delicious Las Vegas tap water.  (I never drink water unless it has coffee in in).\n\nRoberto, whom I presume is the owner - or son of - was extremely patient with our inability to choose what we wanted to eat, but we finally settled on a meat combo and a veggie combo.  We had them combined onto one huge platter.  My favorites were the dry lamb, which was cooked to the consistency of shoe leather.  Normally I like my meat rare, and at first taste I was blown off by it.  But it grew on me, because the flavor was really intense - not spicy, just delicious.  I also loved the pureed yellow peas and the spinach mixed with some sort of cheese, which helped cool down some of the spice, as Roberto suggested.  The string beans were good, but they definitely started out life in a tin can, as did the plain spinach.  There was plenty of injera to mop up everything, but the best injera was the one lining the platter, since it soaked up the flavors of all the foods.  \n\nMy major complaint is that they need better napkins.  It's impossible to eat this kind of messy food and have to use the kind of tissue paper napkins you'd find in a stand-up dispenser at Taco Bell.

I crave the spice factor, the flavors that only Ethiopian food can give.  And this week I gave into that craving.\n\nWe've tried quite a few Ethiopian restaurants in Vegas, and decided to try a new one this time - Blue Nile.\n\nWe arrived on a Wednesday evening and the restaurant was empty.  We weren't deterred because most Ethiopian restaurants are always empty when we choose to dine.  It's the timing!\n\nYou definitely have to pay attention when you're looking for this restaurant.  The outside is nothing to rave about, but it's surprisingly nice inside.  We had our choice of tables and the waiter asked if we were okay with the basketball game on.  We were and once he realized that the Husband was paying attention to the game, he asked if we wanted to move closer to the TV.  We declined but appreciated his offer.  (Note: No language barriers here!)\n\nWe now know what we want these days without needing to look at the menu.  Their menu is pretty short - only 13 items on there!\n\nWe chose the Vegetarian Combo \"A combination dish of pureed split lentil cooked with onion and hot pepper in zesty spicy sauce, green pepper, collared green sauteed with garlic and cooked cured cabbage, potato, and carrots.\" ($9.99) and Kitfo \"Lean red chopped beef minced, blended and delicately seasoned in hot spice...raw, medium, or well-done.\" ($10.99). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-nile-ethiopian-restaurant-las-vegas?select=u5U9roXHFQ1IWpfU1UGZJw#BSv57_OeogGrShN-lmwVMw\n\nThe Vegetarian Combo arrived first and we were starving, so we just dove right in.  We couldn't wait for the Kitfo to arrive although it did shortly after.  (It did seem like we had to wait a little longer than usual for our food...not sure if it's because we were famished or it actually took longer.)  The Husband commented that it looked like we got less food in the combo than other places and looking back at some of the other places we've eaten, I do have to agree.  However, the amount of kitfo we got was quite generous.  We had leftovers!\n\nThe waiter explained everything we got - which was actually Yellow Lentils, Chickpeas, Collared Greens, Red Lentils, Fresh Salad, Cured Cabbage, and String Beans.  (No potato or carrots as mentioned in the menu description.)  Each item was good, but I do believe that the lentils have been a bit more flavorful at other places.  The kitfo was super flavorful though!  We did ask for it to be medium and it was more medium rare, which we still ate.  It also came with a homemade spinach and cheese concoction to help with the heat.  I didn't really notice that much heat coming from any of the food, except when we chose to add the much needed hot red pepper seasoning.\n\nWe needed more water and injera bread, and did have to wait to be noticed first about needing those as opposed to it arriving before we were out.\n\nOverall, it was good.  There were some things better here than others and vice versa, but we'd come back. We usually never have leftovers, so that was a first.

This time, not so hungry after snacking at an earlier function, we decided to go the individual dish route.\n\nThe same 13 choices are on the menu.  Except for one lamb, one fish (which I'd be afraid to try here) and a vegetable combo, the rest are beef, beef, and more beef.  The veggie might have been an option, but not after two of them were listed as collard greens and cabbage.  Not exciting at all.  \n\nI wanted a glass of honey wine, which I had tasted a few years earlier at a different Ethiopian restaurant.  It's a strange wine, but I've got strange tastes.  Almost verbatim, the owner repeated the same line as last time, about the wine coming from L.A. and they didn't get the shipment.  Coincidence?  Maybe.  But I don't think so.  He didn't suggest anything else, and I didn't ask.  I was already feeling the downer vibe, and stuck with water.\n\nI started to order the dry-sauteed beef, but he said it might be a little dry and chewy, so we switched to two others.  They seemed to be variations of the same dish.  One had some tomatoes added to the jalape\u00f1os and onions,  and was in tiny pieces.  The other had longer strips that were way too long to eat comfortably, and also had the jalape\u00f1os and onion, but no tomatoes.  Both dishes were poured into a large tray lined with the injera bread, and the tray had a tiny serving of salad - two tablespoons if I'm being generous - for each of us.\n\nThe small beef dice had no flavor whatsoever.  The long strips had a little more flavor, though not much.  Both were improved by the vinegar in the injera. But they were both tough as nails.  When the owner came over to ask how things were going, I told him that the beef was tough.  He paused a couple of seconds, said \"Okay,\" and walked away.  The salad didn't taste fresh and had some brown pieces.\n\nThe only other customers were a table of four with a baby who didn't stop shrieking the whole time.  But they provided some much-needed entertainment:  the kid sat on the mother's lap and kept yanking at the strings of beads that were the front window curtain.  Each time she pulled, the rod arced downward, and the mom never attempted to stop her.  This being Vegas, I made book with Herb about how long it would take before the whole curtain came crashing down.  Neither of us won, because thankfully they left halfway through our meal.  Then the music was cranked up a little.  I love Arabic music with a beat, 'cause I can belly dance in my seat.  But this stuff was some awful male singer wailing, and it was unbearable.\n\nThe only thing good that I can say is that at least it's cheap.  Each of our beef dishes was 9.99.  But since it comes only with the anemic little bit of salad, and the beef obviously wasn't filet mignon, it wasn't worth even that much.

David's sister and her husband also joined us, so with our party of 5, the best thing to do with their 13 item menu was go with the meat sampler and the vegetarian sampler so we could try a variety of things. We also got one of their Tibs offerings as well.\n\nWe also tried an Ethiopian beer which was pretty good ,and I guess Ethiopians take their coffee seriously as we were sat next to the area where the coffee ceremony takes place which would have been interesting to see, but we were the only diners and we came for the food, not the coffee. I love the opportunity to be able to eat with  your hands and this is one of the few places in town where your hands are the silverware. \n\nOur meal arrives on a huge silver platter and our waiter also disperses the Tibs in small piles onto the platter so that it is accessible to everyone. The smell of the Injera reminded me right away of San Francisco Sourdough and it also does have a slight tang to it due to the fermentation process the Injera batter goes through before being steamed. I loved the flavors of each item I sampled,(Lentils, Collard Greens, Green Beans, Lamb, a Beef Jerky type item, a smoked meat one, etc.) but my favorites were the Lamb, Tibs, and Spicy Lentils.

This small Ethiopian restaurant was across from my hotel room in a nearly deserted strip mall with 100 parking spots, but only featuring two or three cars. It's so deserted, it looks more like a place to skateboard, play roller hockey, or facilitate a drug deal. And well, for all I know, this place could be a drug front. Or in other words, a place where Charlie Sheen might hang out when he's not too busy dating porn stars, ranting about practice, and \"winning.\"\n\nWhen I approached the joint, two Ethiopian guys smoking cigarettes stared at me. And when I entered, I was greeted by a woman with a big smile that was acting as a hostess, server, and bartender. I was the only person inside the humble restaurant that features some old tables, chairs, a full bar, and a flat screen TV (that was showcasing a basketball game). Part of me felt I was in an episode of the Ethiopian version of the Sopranos. It was just two guys sipping coffee and beer at the bar and me. Or in other words, there was just \"two and half men.\" Ba-dum-cha!\n\nI went up the bar and asked for a menu. The server said to sit anywhere and she handed me a paper menu. I was highly entertained and eventually appalled by the number of writing errors in the menu, which included \"Red Strip\" and \"Micalobe\" and \"Merllo\" for beer and wine. Where's the spell check, guys? It looks as if I am dealing with fools and trolls.\n\nLuckily, the joint cooks a whole lot better than it can spell. I ordered \"Ye Awaze Tibs\" and after a long 20 minutes, I was presented with a huge piece of injera (Ethiopian flat sourdough bread) and my dish of red stew (with beef, onions, and green peppers) on the side. The server then poured my steaming hot dish all over the bread, which included a small veggie side. She then brought over two extra pieces of bread and I dug my face into my meal like Charlie Sheen does cocaine.\n\nIt was a nice, filling meal. I just wish it had been spicy (as I had requested).

And then The Blue Nile closed and my heart sank ... until tonight.  This restaurant has been open for more than a year and why I didn't go looking for it till now, I'll never know  (but I'm glad I did).\n\nMy partner and I had the large combo plate, which includes all their vegetarian selections and three meat dishes.  At $13.99, it's a real bargain.  Unfortunately, gluttonous as we are, we EACH had one.  Okay, so we took some of it home (and, for those who know combo dishes, it will lose a lot of charm the next day, because you can't keep the individual dishes apart ... but really:  who cares?).\n\nUnlike Blue Nile, the portions on the combo plate were big and spiced excellently.  The bread was spongy and moist  (yes, for those of you who don't know Ethiopian bread --- which resembles something like the chamois you use to dry your car --- this is exactly what you want to hear).  Hands down, this food is much better than what the Blue Nile used to serve; and we used to drive the 35 miles each way once a week to partake in it.\n\nNow, here are the downsides:\n\nThe restaurant is located in a non-residential and very commercial area, which means business is likely to be slower during off-business hours than it should be.  It's also not the best of neighborhoods; but I'm betting one of the reasons for the property selection is lower rents than, say, in Tempe.  But, unfortunately, location is everything and this restaurant deserves to be packed ALL the time.  Given where it is, however, most students and yuppies, who would both enjoy eating here, won't be here in the evening  (and they do have very extensive operating hours).\n\nThe exterior of the restaurant is nice, but it's decorated to look like \"wood\".

This is the one time I would encourage some bright signage outside.\n\nService is polite, efficient, friendly and fast.

Well you know what fermented foods do to your stomach.  Think SAUERKRAUT.  I no sooner finished than I had to quickly excuse myself and make a beeline to the bathroom.  Now I know when I need a laxative to head to Gojo instead.  LOL\nMy 5 friends ordered 2 of those enormous platters which was way too much for them so they had boxes to go.

There is also an Ethiopian Market in the same strip mall which I almost walked into by mistake, they are not the same place!\nI ordered the meat combo which consisted of traditional injera bread (kind of like a spongy pancake) and three different meats (chicken, lamb, and beef) seasoned with the traditional Ethiopian berbere spices.  When eaten by itself the injera had a very strong flavor somewhat like sourdough bread which was at first a little strange to me, though this is my first experience with Ethiopian cuisine and based on what I've read this is how authentic injera should taste.  However, when eaten together with the meat the flavors complemented each other nicely.  The meat itself was delicious!  It was all very tender and the spices were exotic and tasty.  The dish was about $12, but the portion was huge, enough that I will be able to get two meals out of it.\nNext time I may bring a friend and try dining in.

We were the first to arrive and the black-white colored interior consisted of a small bar, and plenty of tables that spread across several platforms that overlooked a screen looping various images of Ethiopia. \n\nWe had the Meat and Vegetarian Combo ($13.99) that came with seven vegetarian items and our choice of lamb. There were two types of lentils and split peas, string beans, collard greens, spiced cabbage, and mushrooms. The ingredients were fresh and arrived with good consistency. However, the flavors were rather subdued as many items could use more spice and pop in the flavor.  One of their lentils was served at room temperature, and although such practice is common, I still prefer the warm version.\n\nThe Alitcha Wot was a bit dry and very greasy. The lamb was unexpectedly swimming in a pool of oil and not aesthetically pleasing. This is not a dish I would order again.\n\nTheir injera was fluffy and soft. As other reviewers had mentioned, it is on the sour side, but I really enjoyed it. However, there was a general lack of depth and intensity in the flavor when compared to others that might be more authentic.\n\nPortions were huge and menu prices were excellent. Service was warm, friendly, and attentive. However, the worst part of this experience was when they overcharged the meal by having us to pay these two dishes separately--instead of the combo price that was listed on the menu. \n\nSeveral reviewers have mentioned about Blue Nile, so that's the next place I'm going to visit.

This includes all of the veggie options on a thin injera disc and three pieces of injera bread on the side. \n\nFor those of you who have never had injera bread, it's a doughy pancake-y type of bread with a strong sour taste, similar to sourdough bread. I personally enjoyed the injera but one of my friends has a distaste for sourdough bread so it kind of ruined the meal for her. She, however, did like her cabbage that she ordered.

I went there with a dining companion late (a little after 9pm) on a Saturday evening at the end of June and though we weren't greeted immediately by anyone, we were eventually told by the friendly quiet girl at the bar to sit anywhere we liked. She did a very good job of managing the bar, the phone, take out orders and managing the tables---she was our waitress as well.\n\nMy companion and I ended up ordering the Meat/Veggie Combo which included the 3 meat dishes included on the meat combo as well as a sampling of all the veggie dishes which are included on the veggie combo. It was unclear to us until the girl pointed it out, that this was going to be our best option as my companion wanted the Veggie Combo for himself and she assured me that ordering that plus my ordering a meat entree would be A LOT of food for us. We also ordered one Thyme tea and one Ethiopian coffee. Though it was late we were most definitely not rushed and people even came in well after we did and sat and were served. I believe there is a decidedly slower pace for Ethiopian dining, so one shouldn't anticipate normal American restaurant experience (in other words, if you're in any way hurried or impatient, go elsewhere or get take-out).\n\nWhen our food arrived we were still minus our coffee and tea, which we were told were having to be made and they came out shortly after the food. The tea was good and not overpowering and the coffee was wonderful without sweetener of any kind. We were told correctly by our waitress and in fact the Meat/Veggie combo platter was plenty of food for the two of us. Everything tasted very well, although of the meats I'd say the Key Wot (beef) was the clear winner over the Doro Wat (chicken) or the Alitcha Wot (lamb), though there was an entire drumstick included in the middle of the platter with the Doro Wat and the Alitcha Wot was spiced beautifully! All of the veggies we had were wonderfully spiced as well and I think only the cabbage was my least favorite (but I have no great love of cooked cabbages).\n\nI would highly recommend eating here as I would gladly eat here again.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Lovely people and incredible food!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Great friendly service and excellent food!", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 1}}], "state": "AZ", "stars": 4.0, "latitude": 33.479605}]}}
