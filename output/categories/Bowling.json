First, dinner at the RED EMBERS with a few cocktails, opening presents with a few more cocktails, a birthday cake and a few more cocktails, followed by a few lines of bowling for the entire family (Party of 8), and possibly having in a few more cocktails.  This ain't gonna be no cheap date.\n\nTo make things easier, and to add an element of surprise, we decided to take the custom birthday cake we had made to the restaurant where we were to have dinner.  That way, they could serve it for dessert, surprise my daughter and really embarrass her with \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY\".

I explain we're neighbors, this is our first experience with their place, it's my daughter's birthday, etc.  She blames County regulations for this decision.  I inform her that every other establishment we have gone to with this has gladly accepted and served.  She stands on her denial, based on County regs.  I inform her that my wife has several years in Food and Beverage management, including many years at Arrowhead Country Club, and that no regulation exists.  She stands firm.\n\nNot to upset the daughters, my wife and I continue as planned.  The food was okay.  Mark, our server was good.  I believe, as an attempt to pacify, our server comped a birthday brownie after dinner.  Too little, too late.\n\nAs for the bowling experience, again so-so.  Too dark and too noisy.

It has an upstairs and downstairs. Lots of kids and also adults playing. Awesome thing about the lazer tag is if you get hit your not out! It takes about a minute before your gun and vest recharge and you get to keep playing. They have teams . Red and blue. On your lazer gun is your \"team name\". Mine was Falcon.. after the time is up you can look on the big screen outside for your \"team\" name and see how good you did against everybody that was in the game. also see if red or blue team won.

This review is based on our entire experience.\n\nFirst of all, Uptown Alley does not really give you any breaks for a group event--not even if you are 501(c)(3) or raising funds for a good cause which they knew was our purpose. They charged us $2 each for shoes and  $15/hr per lane (we had 20 lanes reserved). So essentially, we would have to raise at least $1000 just to break even. We were told they would open up early for us at 8AM but we had to be out by 10AM when they opened. Come to find out they already open at 8AM on Saturdays so they weren't doing us any big favors. They wouldn't help us advertise our event in their facility even though it would have helped draw people to their business. They offered us no freebies to our participants to encourage them to come back. Our group has over 2000 members in the local community that we could market Uptown Alley to and support as a local business but nope...they weren't interested in that at all. We weren't allowed to bring in donuts, juice, coffee or any food related items for our participants even though it was supposedly before they opened for business. We had to order from their restaurant with the sampling of breakfasty type items they had. Essentially, we were made to feel like they were REALLY going out of their way and doing us a favor by even allowing us to have our event there at all. If we weren't so set on trying to support a local business, we really would have gone somewhere else but our group really does make an effort to keep it local whenever possible. \n\nThe day of our event went off without a hitch. The staff was polite, courteous, helpful, kind and considerate. This definitely made up for the way we were treated in arranging this event. The bowling was fun with plenty of space, broad shoe selection, decent food, and drinks. The service was a bit slow considering they knew we had a group coming. There was 1 server for all of us and we were the only people in the place...which did open at 8AM per the sign on the door and their website! And he didn't really come back to check on us so my lane's guests only had 1 drink and that was it. The food was alright though and was definitely not what you would expect from bowling alley cuisine. Our group had fun though...but I think it's because it was a fun activity. I mean who doesn't enjoy BOWLING?\n\nAs I've understood it in my efforts to market this event, Uptown Alley isn't very community friendly at all. Our district's special education classes don't even go here because they won't give them a break on price! They go to Peoria to AMF! I'm sorry but if you can't support Special Olympics or SPED and give those kids a break, that's just not saying much about your business's philosophy.\n\nSo, although I'd like to say I'd go back to Uptown Alley because they are a local business and its important to support local businesses, it  might be solely as an independent person but not as part of my 501(c)(3) group.  I'm inclined to pass on group efforts since I believe that local businesses should also be supportive of the community.

For the sake of brevity, I am just going to get right to the point.   AVOID.  Serious safety issue here when considering this is supposed to be a place for children as well as adults.\n\nThere are crazy's and chemically unbalanced people everywhere, and I get that.  So I will not spend my review telling you about how some chemically unbalanced and likely very unhappy woman started yelling at my son and 9 other of his friends because they dared to enter the lazer tag room at the same time as her \"private party\".  Luckily for the sake of all humanity, she yelled and screamed at the kids (during a two minute window where I was inattentive and dared to use the restroom) to the point where one of the kids was crying because of this crazy lady.  \n\nAnyways, my real problem is not the crazy lady, because in the end her own self-made Karma will probably get her in the form a divorce or two...  but the real problem is that the management at Uptown should have told her bluntly to not yell at children like that.  She was unhinged and should have been removed from the premises.  Her drinking problem should not have resulted in my group of children being yelled at.\n\nSo to Uptown Alley, here is all I can really say to you....great property, nice alley...but if you do not have the moral fortitude to stand up protect children (which you did not because your manager explained to me the lady yelling at MY kids had spent a lot of $ on her party...) then you are not in the right.\n\nAVOID UPTOWN ALLEY.

It's also handy when bellying up to the bar and bartender gives you a smile. It just brings a place like this up a notch from an already solid entertainment model.\n\nThis place is great.

We arrived exactly at noon, parked, and made our way to the bar, where we found two seats and were promptly greeted by a bartender.\n\nWe both ordered the lunch special - 2 piece deep fried cod plate with fries, slaw, tartar, dinner roll, and soda.  The bartender took our order and came back with a complimentary bowl of popcorn, which was a nice surprise.\n\nPlates arrived about 10 minutes later - the fish was appropriately sized, as were the fries - no imbalance, and portions were fair.\n\nThe fish itself had a flavorful beer batter that was a little thicker than what you'll typically find at most places, but it was delicious and I welcomed the extra crunch.\n\nInside, the fish itself was a tad watery with just a hint of grease - not anything outrageous, but just enough to sense that it was there.  Flavor of the fish was incredibly mild; the batter stole some of its thunder.  \n\nThe fries were excellent - battered-style and straight cut.  I'm told the slaw and tartar were \"average.\"  Dinner roll was hard and dry.\n\nTotal lunch bill for two: $14.64, and we were in-and-out within 35 minutes.

I'll briefly break down how I gauge them (I've been many times, both before and after the renovation)\n\nFacility:  Great environment, a reasonable number of lanes (although not as many as other alleys in the area), a roomy bar with TVs for the sports games, and an upstairs that has both pool as well as a rental area that hosts private functions or tournaments.\n\nCost:  Fairly cheap if you go on open bowling nights, I think it's around $1 or $2 a game plus shoes.  I'm sure it's hiked up otherwise.  Open Bowling is usually after 9pm during the week and not a bad option.  We used to go on Thursdays which seems to be a good night for them.\n\nFood:  It's typical bar food.  They have good cheese curds, and the usual fare that you'd see at an alley.  Nothing to write home about but if you're in the mood for a greasy burger you probably won't go wrong.\n\nService:  I cannot stand the people that work at the counter.  There's a couple of older guys (50-60+) who obviously hate life and want to project that on you when you're there.  Everytime I've gone in I've tried to be courteous and polite, and asked simple basic questions like \"I'd like to get a lane, there's 3 of us and we all need shoes\" etc, etc.  These guys first look at you like you walked into the wrong bar, and then respond with gruff, 2 second answers that doesn't help either party move the process along.  It's really irritating because I've gone to this alley off and on for probably about 10 years or so, and it's always been like that.  The bartenders, when you get a woman, are usually friendly and don't share the same attitude.\n\nPersonally I'm more of a Schwoeglers guy, but their prices for open bowling are more expensive and the atmosphere is noiser, so Sport Bowl sometimes wins out.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Hadn't been to the SportBowl for quite some time, but visited for lunch today, thanks to a hot-tip about the burgers and curds.  Some co-workers had been raving about them, and ever the skeptic, I had to verify the claims for myself.\n\nArrived at around noon on a Friday, and copped-a-squat at one of the numerous bar stools.  A very friendly bartender walked over, menu in hand, and asked what I'd like to drink.  I ordered an iced tea, and browsed the menu.\n\nTea arrived within a minute, and I placed my order: cheese curds and a bacon cheeseburger, with pepper jack, cooked medium, please.\n\nThe bartender left with my order, and I passed the time by watching the Big-10 basketball tournament and gazing around at the large and expansive bar area.\n\nThe food arrived, and it looked spectacular.  Let's start with the curds.\n\nFriends, I know curds.  Believe me.  You can read all you want about the \"awwwesome\" and \"amaaaaaazing\" curds from the Old Fashioned - those suck.  Point blank - they suck.  They're greasy, they're usually over-cooked, and they're bland.\n\nWhat \"saves\" the OF's curds is their tiger sauce.  And I don't care who you are, but to borrow from another reviewer, \"Sauce does not a good curd make\" (sorry Doctress, I saw your line in the El Tigre review, and had to borrow it).  \n\nThe Sport Bowl's curds are DEFINITELY homemade.  You can tell simply by looking at them that these offerings begin as simple, unbreaded curds, are battered and rolled in a breading (probably Cornflake or cracker?), and then carefully deep-fried.\n\nAnd the result speaks for itself.  They are EXCELLENT.  So good (see photo).  The bartender confirmed they take 'bare' curds, and give 'em the batter/breading treatment, all to order.  I believe him.  You need to believe me - these are the best curds you'll find outside of Green County.\n\nThe burger was equally excellent, and I'm going to go on record to say the burgers here are without a doubt in the Top 3 for Madison-area burgers.  \n\nKnoche's Market supplies the beef.  It's hand-pattied and grilled to perfection.  I asked for medium and received a true medium burger.  The burger wasn't dry and it wasn't greasy.  It had a delicious smokey, charcoaled flavor that instantly brought back memories of mid-summer grill-nights back home...\n\nThe pepperjack had a nice kick, and the bacon served as pork-icing on the cow cake (I'd have said 'beef cake' but that's a bit over-the-top).\n\nThe bun was light and airy - very fresh tasting and lightly toasted.  \n\nThe burger was so good that I'd have no problem eating it completely plain - burger and bun alone.

Which, if you can't tell by the number of stars above these paragraphs, is pretty tasty.  To start, the cheese curds are required eating.  I think they just take cheddar cheese cubes, bread them, and fry them, but they are delicious when fresh.  Make sure to eat them quick, however, because, like all cheese curds, they harden when they cool and have a weird texture after that point.  \n\nWhen you think bar food, you think burgers.  And the burgers at the Sport Bowl are excellent.  Not only are they excellent, they are fairly priced as well.  At lunch, you can get a burger + fries (battered!) + soda for eight bucks.  I can see some people thinking the burgers are too greasy, but the grease gives you a delightful \"contented, weighed down, and fuzzy-brained\" feeling afterwards.  \n\nA quick rundown on other items I've tried: the meatball sub was so-so, but huge.  Go to Gino's a mile away if you're craving meatballs.  The turkey club is stacked high and tastes exactly as you would expect.  The patty melt is just a burger on bread, so obviously it rules hard.  The pizza is decent, with a crust that tastes like Pizza Hut's deep dish.  The fish fry is a lot of good food for a good price.  The \"Philly\" cheesesteak is too greasy even for me.\n\nThe best part about the Sport Bowl is that if you feel some postprandial guilt for your frenzied ingestion of large amounts of fat and grease, you can pop over to Willy West next door to get an organic hippie-smoothie.

Opening night at Lucky Strike went swimmingly, and it has been getting better and better ever since. \n\nThe atmosphere is reminiscent of Big Lebowski, which coincidentally was the model bowling alley for the first Lucky Strike. It's a small bowling alley with only 12 lanes, a lounge and bar area, and pool tables. Make no mistake, it isn't cramped, just a small place with a lot going on. By day you'll enjoy well lit lanes and a bright casual atmosphere, but by night, that all changes drastically. Lucky Strike is predominately a night club on the weekends, when the music is loud, the lights are low, and the sexy people are aplenty, sometimes three deep standing at the bar with a 2 hour wait for a lane. Some say the Old Town crowd has moved in, but I say it's a diverse and fun mix of people all with the same intention of dancing to old school hip hop, bowling, and having some fun downtown. The bowling lanes are a little nicer than your standard bowling alley. They have newer and better scoring machines, TVs behind the pins, and all state of the art technology. It's really fantastic.\n\nThroughout dozens of visits, once as many as three times in a 24 hour period, I've recieved both exceptional service and awful service, with no real consistency either way. One visit, we sat down at the bar by the window in the back of the club, and were told we could not order drinks there. Another visit, I waited 15 minutes to get my tab after requesting it, though we were the only ones there. Other visits, the service was so perfect that we felt we could may as well be guests in someone's home. The staff here is all friendly, and everyone seems to like their job. I have a theory on the service, and that is the way the managerial staff has the place set up. It doesn't flow well for the servers. Example, there is a bar right by the bowling lanes which is never open. The other bar is around the corner, down the stairs, in another room. Servers must go here to refill a drink or get a beer, which makes it take forever. They should really work on a way to make food and drink service more expeditious. \n\nBy this point, I've tried every item on Lucky Strike's $5.50 lunch special (lunch, soda, shoes, and one game) menu and they have all been good. Some of the standouts for me are the Turkey Brie sandwich, a mixture of sliced turkey, melted brie, and apple butter on a Ciabatta, the Bleu Mini Burger, served in a duo (you can mix and match with other types as well) with house made french fries. You really can't go wrong with any of it, though. The happy hour menu features half priced \"Lounge Menu,\" $2 domestic drafts, and I forget what else from 4- and 9-close 7 nights a week. I love the pretzel dippers, served with garlic butter, mustard, and cheese dip, as well as the Beef Skewers with a spicy and sweet glaze. The same mini burgers are available at happy hour as well. \n\nIn actuality, if you're a hardcore bowler, you might not care about all the flash and bang at Lucky Strike. You might not care that there are beautiful women serving you food and drinks right at your lane while wearing little black mini skirts. You might not notice the DJ booth in the lounge area, and you surely might ignore the animations on the screen when you get a strike, but for those of us who can't seem to muster more than 125 a game, and really just want to hang out in a cool place with great food and friendly people, Lucky Strike is heaven.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 3, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "I went to Lucky Strike on Saturday Night.

I kind of expected a longer wait.  We all sit down at the bar, order some drinks, and grab a bite to eat.  I had a club sandwich (not so great), friends had a pizza (they seemed to like it), and the last of our foursome had the pretzels sticks (I stole one and loved it).

I've been to the Lucky Strike in LA, and have always had a great time.\n\nI've been to Lucky Strike PHX about 4 times since it opened and for the most part, the wait and bar staff have been above par in their customer service. I am particularly appreciative of waitress Nicole, who has an uncanny ability to almost anticipate what the customer needs before they even ask. She has an overall pleasant personality without being too saccharin-sweet, know what I mean?\n\nFor employees like Nicole, I commend Lucky Strike. \n\nNow, here's why Lucky Strike irritates me: it's their \"we're hot shit\" mentality. \n\n1. I tried to reserve one lane for a Wednesday night, and they respond with a \"we only take reservations 7 days prior.\" IT'S A WEDNESDAY NIGHT, FOR CRISSAKES! And this is Phoenix--not Hollywood, not DC, not Miami. People are not going to be lining up for lanes on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday night. At least NOT YET.\n\n2. Do you validate parking? No, you don't. Not even an hour validation. Hell, CVS does even if we just buy a package of band-aids, but you don't. So we have to pay the $12 parking fee.  Throw us a bone here! We are Phoenicians who try to minimize walking in the heat. We like convenience but not at a steep price. Phoenician women also like to wear heels so why make them walk just to go to your establishment and spend AT LEAST $14 for the first game, $10 any additional games, and some change for libations and grub. You want us to patronize you, work with us. CVS did.\n\n3. I know you're new but you gotta train your receptionists or the people who are tasked to answer the phones first. They are not rude, but they do sound clueless machines who will spew out the corporate answers to your questions. Just saying. A few almost sound as if they're \"hot shit.\"\n\n4. On your website, the dress code states: Head gear is not permitted. But it seems to me, fedoras are okay. Last I checked, a fedora is head gear. C'mon, don't be a hatist (as in HAT not HATE). Stick your policy and be fair. If you think a baseball cap might be gang-related...just remember the Mafias of yesteryears wore fedoras. If you're going to say \"head gear,\" mean it and don't let your hosts make a subjective decision whether a hat is offensive or not. You're not god of head gears. (But do me a favor and kick out anyone wearing Ed Hardy caps.)\n\nLucky Strike, please understand that Phoenix is still learning that there is life after 5:30p.m. in the downtown area. We're not a tough crowd. I mean we're fascinated by flashing lights and air-conditioning. But we do need some coddling, some TLC. And when you \"win us over,\" believe you me, we will be fierce followers. But the: 7-day advance reservation, no validated parking, the \"we're hot shit\" attitude might.and inconsistent dress code policy will not win us over. And I personally, would like for you to succeed here.\n\nWe Phoenicians are quite different form the LA, Miami, Denver, etc. people, so don't categorize us the way you would categorize them. We are fascinated with your right now--your concept is so hip and cool, we like it!

It turns out that we finished one game in 15 minutes. I would have been pissed to pay $17 for 15-20 minutes. My husband ordered a beer, me a water that tasted like flat sprite. Yuck when you are not expecting that. The server rectified it very quickly, though. I also ordered their pretzel snack that had 3 soft pretzel sticks with a trio of dips (cheese, mustard, and a garlic butter that intoxicated me with its smell). The app was $7 but I hear it is cheaper during happy hour (which they also have a reverse HH, by the way). My only beef with the app is it should be four instead of three pretzels since most people would split it with someone. Then you have the awkward \"who will take the last one, or do we split it?\"\n\nThe game was pretty fun and I would recommend getting an hour if you are going with a group. Thirty minutes was about right for the two of us and was two games.

It looks more like a martini bar or gallery or something. . . \n\nAnd truth be told it probably works better as a martini bar and gallery than as a bowling alley.\n\nAs a bowling alley it's small in most dimensions. There are -- I believe-- 8 lanes. The approach area for each lane is adjacent to the ball-returns, which is a bit off-putting for those used to more ample spaces. And as bowling goes (at $4 per game) it's a bit expensive. The furniture is soft and comfy--in addition to being retro-chic modern--but with 8 people playing per lane there really isn't enough of it. \n\nWe were told by the staff that first of all, we would need to bowl in teams of 8 per lane. That's understandable, and didn't pose much of a difficulty among our group of 16. However, the payment for the games could only be split into a maximum of two transactions. That meant that we needed to pay two people with cash who then bought our bowling fun in a sort of straw sale.  Inconvenient, especially considering that 4 or 5 people suddenly needed to run to an ATM and probably pay a 3-dollar fee. Is there another way to handle it? Probably.\n\nThen there are the laughable intellectual property regulations. We were told we couldn't take pictures of each other inside because everything inside is copyrighted. Well . . . y'know. . . . in this day of cell-phone cameras and fast CCD's that don't need flashes . . . well . . . I'VE GOT YOUR COPYRIGHT RIGHT HERE, PAL!!! Let me just say \"f*cking lawerly morons\" and leave it at that. \n\nI ordered a martini that really wasn't too bad. Nothing to write home about. I think it came in at $9. It really wasn't worth that. I noticed others enjoying sliders and pretzels that looked good.\n\nSo what you get at Lucky Strike is a sanitized bowling experience with new equipment in a very nicely lit space.

The decor is amazing and we love how you can watch the lanes while hanging out in the bar. We sat down and as soon as the waitress saw us, I picked up the menu and asked \"Is this the happy hour menu?\" And she said \"Yes, it is all 1/2 priced\" Perfect. My husband and I both got a well mixed drink. It was fine. However, our bartender/waitress was throwing off a weird vibe (I don't know how to explain it, but she made us feel uncomfortable and barely said a word to us) so we decided to just have the one drink and leave. We paid and after exiting, we saw the sign that had their happy hour specials listed which said $3 well drinks. We both got well drinks but were charged $5 for each drink. I understand that we sat down about 8 minutes before 4pm that day but after remembering that the first thing I asked the bartender was about their happy hour specials, you would assume you would get happy hour prices or she would tell you that she would have to wait until after 4pm to honor the prices if their pos system worked that way.

While there were also several pool tables in the building, the actual bowling area was pretty small, with only a dozen lanes. Each lane had some couches and additional stool seating behind the lanes, but to get by everyone at your lane, you really had to wiggle around them because the couches were so close to the balls. It was incredibly awkward and forces you to get super-close to the people you're with.\n\nAlso, while there were some televisions broadcasting sports above the lanes, one of the screens simply scrolled through random pieces of art. I much rather would have watched music videos of the songs that were playing (which were not good, by the way-Jamiroquai, seriously?!). The whole art thing was sort of bizarre to me and actually made the place seem less hip.\n\nThe crowd there, surprisingly, was mostly suits who probably came straight from work.

If you are looking for a really good way to spend a Friday night these guys do a great job. \nOne note on the location--It is in the Southwest corner on the second floor on the corner of Jefferson and 1st Avenue.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "We went to watch an MMA fight and it was great, the food was good, the service was good and the atmosphere was great.

I couldn't even believe how pissy the clientele were, and the bartender was nowhere to be seen (probably scared off by those mean-mugging brutes hogging the good seats in front of the game)...no biggy, there are other bars with TVs out there.

It was pleasurable. In other words, I had been eagerly anticipating a return.\n\nMy second experience was cause enough to never return. \n\nPicture this- there were perhaps 10-20 patrons in attendance, and mind you, 'twas about 1:15AM when we arrived. We had no intent to bowl as they have a spectacular looking bar that actually showcases local artists' works (I'd give them more than two thumbs up if I physically could for this) so the idea was to grab a few cocktails. Service was lackadaisical at best even though we were the only ones at the bar itself.\n\nThe epic fail that we ran headfirst into was the extreme absence of management, poor salesmanship on behalf of the bartenders, and the uber extremism of the  \"bouncers.\" Unfortunately whenever there are a bunch of guys behind me yelling at me to \"get the f~\u20ack out\" after the bartender has just delivered a drink, I am going to be a bit frustrated. By the way, it was still before 2:00AM.\n\nUltimately it's a shame. As I was walking out I told one of the \"bouncers\" that I would never be back, to which he replied, \"It's no skin off my back.\" For a service-based business in downtown Phoenix to have such a blatant disregard for any patronage they may acquire is simply dumbfounding. I live a few blocks away and whole-heartedly wanted this place to be a \"go to\" spot for when friends and family from other parts of the valley and from out of state visit, but if the \"bouncers\" are the only voice here then I would prefer to give my business to anywhere besides Lucky Strike.\n\nUpdate:\nThe GM here, Dallas, actually contacted me personally based on my last experience. He invited us back and promised to make things right. And he most certainly did! He helped me plan a big night for my girlfriend's birthday and everything was perfect! I can't say enough how impressed I am that someone made an effort to fix a poor experience; it says a great deal about the dedication of the current management and I look forward to frequenting Lucky Strike now.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "My first two experiences with Lucky Strike/Gypsy were less than stellar (see my review of Gypsy Bar in 2012). In fact, my first two experiences were so bad that I vowed never to return. Then I was contacted by the new manager of Lucky Strike/Gypsy informing me that the bar I despised was now under new management, had a new chef, a new menu, and a new staff with a new attitude. I was intrigued. \n\nMy mind is not often changed once it's set, but in this case - the new management team behind Lucky Strike and Gypsy Bar have completely turned this place around. The drinks and food continue to be a bit pricey for a \"bar,\" but they still offer great lunch and happy hour specials, and now there's a HUGE difference - the food actually tastes great and the service is amazing. \n\nFor three hours tonight my friends and I bowled, ate, and drank to our heart's content. We started out with the homemade Belgian fries with chimichurri aioli and the short rib tacos. The fries were delish, and the tacos were decent - I liked the short rib meat and sauce on the taco, but the shells were a little stale. I suggest that in the future they should serve the tacos in soft corn tortillas and replace the blah lettuce with some sugar cured cabbage (a la Fuego Tacos) because the shell and rabbit food just detracted from the great texture and flavor of the filling and sauce. We also ordered the buffalo chicken flatbread, the chicken quesadilla, and blue chips off of the $4 happy hour menu. I didn't try any of those, but from the way the chips and quesadillas disappeared, I assume they were fine. The flatbreads didn't really win anyone over, but two out of three ain't bad. We also ordered the grilled steak sandwich and the crispy bread pudding bites. The steak was a fatty cut and the juices soaked the bottom piece of grilled artisan bread, but it was seasoned PERFECTLY and the bread managed to hold together. I actually love steak juices and found the bottom piece of bread to be a soppy piece of heaven - much like when I find myself eating a really good French dip with grilled crusty bread and a perfect au jus. The crispy bread pudding bites came with a creme anglaise and were vaguely reminiscent of a simpler time in Jack in the Box's history when they served delicious deep friend french toast sticks on their 24 hour breakfast menu. In layman's terms, the tiny squares of deep fried bread pudding were extremely addictive and hit the spot.  \n\nOverall, I was pretty impressed with the revamped menu. The tacos and sandwiches were about $14 each and some of the premium cocktails were about $13 each - once again on the high end - but they were all tasty and I really did enjoy myself with their clean facility, multitude of games available, and spazzy bowling alley. I would give Lucky Strike/Gypsy bar a solid 4 stars for the reimagined bar food menu and ability to entertain people of all ages. However, it was the service that shot this place over the moon for me.
