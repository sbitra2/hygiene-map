I always like the baked oatmeal.  I have tried to make this at home but it never turns out as well.    \n\nThey have remained true to their coffee shop roots here. The prices are reasonable and if you let them know you'll be hanging around for awhile, they'll save your tea leaves and give you a refill later!!  (Warning, you will smell like coffee when you leave this place!!  =) )\n\nI come hang out and work from here for a few afternoons a month.  Free Wi-fi is available, and it's a pretty quiet place with some mellow tunes playing in the background.  Unless you catch live music or the storytellers club here, it's a great place to hang out and get some work done. The events are cool too, if you can come to watch and be entertained.\n\nWith all of that said, I recently had a bad experience here with a staff member being very rude to me.  I  called the Manager and spoke with her on the phone about the issue and she apologized and said that she did not condone the behavior of her staff member.   As a regular customer over the years,  I fully recognize that one bad experience with one particular staff member in about a decade  doesn't warrant a terrible review.   Nonetheless, Terra Java has some work to do to earn back my business.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 4, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Nice place for coffee and hang out with friends.

We normally go to Treehouse, but this is so much closer. \n*Our food (one order) took about 20 minutes, this might get worked out as they settle in, but it was a long wait (one of the chefs did come talk to us and apologized)\n* the smoothie tasted like pureed kale, they did ask for feedback on it, which was great, but doesn't help my situation at the moment, i tossed it when i got home \n* there are minimal vegan options on the menu, I saw 3, I guess I was expecting more based on their baked goods and other options at the farmers market (so this could be my own issue, but I was really disappointed, there is such a need for that in this area)\n\nOverall, the food was ok, the ambience is great!

Beyond the food and beverages, the appeal extends to the bright, eclectic atmosphere of the cafe. The staff is very friendly,  the cafe's location is convenient, and the availability of parking is excellent. Plus, free WiFi  with a good strong signal; my tablet browses the Internet really fast when I'm in this bakery/cafe.

Yet, contrary to what the idiom implies, eating humble pie courtesy of Humble will not cause humiliation. In fact, the only potential error in this scenario would stem from one's failure to bask in the deliciousness that is Humble. For within the close confines of this corner bakeshop rests a highly concentrated aroma of caramelized sugar and autumnal spices heartily injected with a dose of bonafide love. It's just like grandma's house.\n\nThe bakery also engages pie fans with its deliciously enervating Facebook posts. While these viral announcements are most certainly not in your body's best interest, these guys offer true therapy for the soul. Not much can brighten the day more than reading rapturous descriptions of the bakery's daily menu, laden with pictorial representations of their latest sugary concoctions.\n\nThe name Humble serves as a sincere embodiment of the way in which sisters and co-owners of the pie shop -- Shelly Cross and Jill Long -- run their business. Devoted to the concept of extracting bold flavors out of a modest set of ingredients, Humble expertly resembles the degree of humility and delicious subtlety that its name implies. With an admirable dedication to locally-sourced, farm-fresh ingredients, Humble offers pies that are both estimable for their divine flavor profiles and dedication to the sustainable food movement. With a tantalizing menu of sweet and savory pies that rotates based on local availability, each week delivers a wonderfully unforeseen array of seasonally-inspired pie varieties.\n\nHumble pies thankfully come in more than nine shapes and sizes, which allow for great versatility for customers and their various events. Free-form slab pies and large rustic tarts offer copious amounts of sugary goodness, while the rustic pinch pies and tiny pie bites are perfection in terms of indulgence for one. Regardless of size, Humble blurs the line between sweet and savory by making pies that gloriously meld both of these two distinct taste classes. Most recently, their menu has incorporated the wondrous tastes of fall with the classic sweet flavors of pumpkin, apple, rustic plum, salted honey, pecan and cardamom sweet potato, as well as the more savory flavors with bacon leek potato quiche, chicken pot pie, rosemary grape and goat cheese pasty.\n\nA fair amount of new flavor developments can also be found on the menu, specifically in the form of a delightful maple glazed sweet potato goat cheese galette. An indulgently flaky brandied apricot and brie hand pie as well as an innovative creamy chocolate tart in a parmesan walnut crust join these tasty concoctions. In spite of the ever-changing pie varieties at Humble, the selection is not complete without the nearly unfailing presence of one of the shop's best sellers: the chocolate peanut butter pie. A classic fixation of all two-legged beings who are fortunate enough to not have a peanut allergy, chocolate and peanut butter are the perfect dessert partners-in-crime. Their compatibility beats that of peanut butter and jelly any day, and Humble's version of the classic duo certainly proves it.\n\nHumble is excellence on all levels. Their minimalistic approach to the art of pie craft combined with constant development of their weekly menu is commendable.

Both were fresh, seasoned well, and portioned perfectly (especially for a health-conscious preggo; not too little, but not so much that I left feeling overly full!)

First off there are chalkboards out front advertising happy hour $1 bottles of wine.  Same thing on the front of the menu.  (Actually it is also listed that way on the front page of their website.) I actually asked as soon as I sat down if that was a joke.  I was informed you buy a bottle at regular price and the second is $1.  You have to ask or turn over your menu to see that detail.  No asterisk, no small print, nothing.  Is that even legal advertising?!\n\nSecond we had a groupon for 4 flights of wine and 2 tapas or bruschetta plates.  The wine was the first to come out.  We were told they were a chardonnay, a merlot and a cabernet sauvignon all from a vineyard in California.  We first tried the white wine and enjoyed it.  Surprised that it tasted like no chardonnay we had ever had we asked with the menu which chardonnay from CA it was.  The waiter left and came back and told us that actually he was wrong and the flight wines are all tap wines from a barrel made in Tuscon?!?!  What is tap wine?\n\nThird when we got our bill only one appetizer was taken off.  When the waiter was informed of the mistake he argued a bit that the groupon was only for one appetizer.  He had to take the coupon out of his pocket to inspect it again.  Then he left and came back having taken off the $4 fries we added on later instead of the $7 Hummus nachos that we had originally ordered as part of the deal.

We were fine with that. \n\nI ordered the piquillo bruschetta. My boyfriend the Pepperonata sandwich. The bruschetta had a pepper spread, green bell peppers, onion, bacon and smoked Gouda. When it came out I was already disappointed. When I order bruschetta I expect the bread to be crunchy (I know what is bruschetta...I'm Italian). The bread wasn't even close to toasted. The \"pepper\" spread tasted like it was BBQ sauce out of a bottle mixed with ketchup and some pepper for a kick. The bell peppers, onion, and Gouda were diced. The bacon was diced as well and cold. It's as if the chef cut bread slapped BBQ sauce on it cut the veggies and let the bacon thaw out before placing it on the top. I'm not confident the bacon was anymore then thawed out. Cooked? Not sure. The piquillo bruschetta can beat described as a Red Baron frozen pizza, left outside of the freezer, thawed and served. \n\nMy boyfriends sandwich wasn't much better. He ate maybe a quarter of it and gave up. We both focused on the fries (the only saving grace to the meal). \n\nWhile their wine and beer selection is appealing, their food is disappointing.

Since we bought the groupon, the two person deal included two craft drinks, two entrees (any of the burgers or entrees under $17) and one dessert to share.  Our friends had their own groupon, so it was nice to sample several different drinks and entrees.  \n\nThe drinks we sampled included the cucumber mule, the lavender and lemon fizz, the peach fuzz fizz, and the prohibition manhattan.  The lavender and lemon fizz was definitely the lightest of all the drinks; the manhattan was the strongest.  My husband liked the manhattan but couldn't finish his peach fuzz.  Our friend and I were a fan of the lavender and lemon fizz (i particularly enjoyed how similar it is to real lavendar lemonade) but she especially liked the cucumber mule because it came in a copper mug that made it just that more authentic in taste.  Overall the drinks seemed well made with quality spirits. \n\nWe really liked the glasses and our waiter told us most of the restaurant's decor and furniture was made of reclaimed products.  All of our glasses were made from old alcohol bottles, which I really liked.  The atmosphere was intimate, the lighting was low, and the music was chill.  I fell like the booth we were in was a little tight and cramped - I would ask for a table next time. \n\nOur friends order an appetizer while we waited for our entrees: the prosciutto bruschetta was good but our friends felt the drizzled honey was a little overpowering.  Personally I liked the little sweetness to balance out the salty prosciutto and tart granny smith apples.  I barely tasted the blue cheese smear and didn't even notice the almond - both which are pluses for me because I'm not a fan of blue cheese.\n\nOur entrees came out and we were pretty happy with our individual choices.  My husband ordered the Italian panini with the greek fries - not sure what special spices they put in the fries, but those were very addicting.  Next time I'm ordering a plate of those for myself - no sharing!  The panini was very good - just the right amount of saltiness. \n\nOn the recommendation of our waiter I had the piquillo ravioli with chicken. I think it was a very good choice - it wasn't too spicy and the ravioli is stuffed with herbs, roasted corn, and parmesan.  The sauce was made of the piquillo peppers, wild mushrooms, and toasted pine nuts - similar to a chunky, roasted pepper sauce.  They placed grilled chicken on top of the ravioli, but I think I would consider it a win even without extra protein.  It came with two crostini that I thoroughly enjoyed sopping up the sauce with. \n\nOur friends had the pistachio encrusted salmon and the grilled chicken panini - according to them they both enjoyed their dishes.  The salmon came on a bed of lemony orzo and brocolini - I enjoyed orzo but felt the brocolini was a little bland and lacked flavor.  \n\nWe all finished with two orders of the s'mores - thoroughly entertaining as we caught our marshmallows on fire!  S'mores are a little too sweet for me, but it's campy fun (see what I did there)?\n\nAll in all a good time.  Our waiter was even nice enough to give us a free appetizer coupon on the way out - yay!

The deal on the living social website clearly said it included two cocktails, one appetizer and an entree of my choice. When I brought up the deal on my phone, it showed it was only valid for the two drinks and one appetizer, NO entree. While that probably isn't the restaurant's fault, it was pretty annoying but didn't try and prove the error and just decided to enjoy myself. It's also important to note that you can't use a LS deal before 6 or 6:30 (can't remember which now). Hence the reason for the tiny print at the bottom that said 'Reservations Required'. Luckily they kept me hydrated with water while we waited the 20 minutes for my deal to be good. It's a cute spot and initially I was sat outside because the Happy Hour was hoping inside and no tables were available. I could see this patio as a really nice spot to come hang out once the weather cools off and enjoy their happy hour special of buy one bottle of wine, get the next one for $1. Unfortunately I had a big group of smokers join me on the patio and that mixed with the misters was pretty gross. Being a former smoker, I appreciate my clean air! It would be nice if they could go somewhere else beside the patio.\n\nHaving said that, the server was friendly, sat us inside after about a 10 minute wait and she had no issues using the LS deal. I ordered the grapefruit martini and the Peach Fuzz Fizz as drinks and both were delicious! For an appetizer I chose the Peppy Dew Peppers. I wasn't sure what I was going to get but a new love of goat cheese prompted me to give them a try. When 4 little peppers were brought out on a wooden board (for $8), I was a bit surprised at the small portions. That was until I had my first bite. They were incredible! I loved them! Definitely crave worthy! Each pepper was two bites, which equals about a $1 a bite. Worth every penny in my opinion! We also shared the Salut Fries, which were pretty good. A nice dipping sauce would have really set them off though. All entrees were pretty good (Roasted Corn Salad with Chicken) and while their salad plates were oddly proportioned and it looked like you didn't get much, the salad filled me up and was really good. The server was great, attentive and friendly the whole night so I came out of there a happy camper that night.\n\nFast forward to the next Friday and I'd been thinking about those peppers every day!

This time we opted for beers (hooray! They have Papago Orange Blossom!!) and shared a Sun Devil sandwich and the Italian Panini. Neither one was really great but I did eat more of the panini than the turkey burger and almost left my whole portion on my plate. The poblano pepper on the burger was super hot and I had to take it off and the turkey was dry. The panini was good, just nothing extraordinary.

But now that Salut is serving brunch (and this is a recent development), I consider dining here for that late lazy Sunday calorie-bomb a real treat!\n\nI sniffed out this joint through New Times' Chow Bella blog and couldn't get the imagery of its menu items out of my head. Oreo pancakes? For reals? Cinnamon Toast Crunch chicken and waffles? Strange and subtle twists on the traditional breakfast appear to be afoot. With a pumped up notion of myself, I finally trotted this place out to my broheimers after failing miserably in the past to provide impressive local brunchy options. Salut did not disappoint! We had a wonderful dining experience that is sure to repeat itself the next time we return.\n\nAmongst our samplings at the table we had: 1) the aforementioned Cinnamon Toast Crunch chicken and waffles; 2) the chorizo gravy eggs benedict; and 3) the salami, cheddar, bacon and egg panini. I couldn't taste the Cinnamon Toast Crunch that prominently in my precious shared bite of my dining neighbor's dish, but he was apparently a big fan. I love this concept, however, so I will order it one of these days. My one bite of the chorizo eggs benedict seemed appropriately creamy and I noted some Southwestern spice notes, but I considered it a tad undersalted/underseasoned. My breakfast panini with salami and cheddar was pretty much spot on, though, so I was a happy camper.\n\nA few more notes, however. I'm a big hot sauce fan (especially with eggs) and was disappointed in their selection here when I asked. I was told they only had sriracha and Frank's available. Any restaurant that serves eggs oughta have an appropriate pepper sauce available (since they serve Bloody Marys here amongst the other fancy cocktails, one would hope that have Tabasco behind the bar). Admittedly, I'm so much of a hot sauce snob that I think for eggy dishes, green (jalape\u00f1o) Tabasco should be de rigueur.\n\nAt any rate, the inventive brunch menu, the ambience, the reasonable price range and the attentive service compel me to give this place five stars.

The new venue boasts of a much larger dining area; is brightly lit (thanks to the entire north wall consisting of windows); has Vegan, Raw, and Gluten-free bakery items; as well as a cutting-edge Veg and Raw menu that consists of innumerable items that will absolutely-positively knock your socks off with flavor!  \n\nOne thing that stands out at 24 Carrots, in comparison to other Veg restaurants of this type, is the freshness of the ingredients. Picture produce from local farms. Imagine produce handpicked by the owner that very day. Think taste explosion with each and every bite! And this isn't just a once-in-a-while sort of thing, as 24 Carrots changes their menu weekly to reflect what's available from their dedicated local suppliers.\n\nBut the food at 24 Carrots is much more than just morsels as fresh as the morning dew. That's because 24 Carrots' redwoods-among-spruce reputation can be found in the sheer uniqueness and creativity of the menu items themselves. For this is no ordinary Veg food consisting of fake-meat sandwiches on vanilla-white bread or bland, grossly-overpriced rice bowls. Instead, you're getting is a bumper crop of culinary originality, food created by climbing mountains that other venues of this type have not yet dared to scale. And just when you think it can't get any better, 24 Carrots routinely tops themselves with some new flavor sensation that will curl your toes and shake, rattle, and roll your taste buds with utter delight!\n\nAlso, the new location has a much bigger staff, yet equally as friendly (thanks to greatly-expanded kitchen space having abundant room for more help), and that means they can now crank out their culinary masterpieces in short order.  And there's even comfy couches and chairs to sit on for people waiting for their lickety-split orders. Though, if time is not an issue, feel free to just hang out and sample one of their hit-the-spot juices or smoothies while you surf the web (and, of course, the Yelp website) on 24 Carrots' free Wi-Fi.   \n\nOverall, my two thumbs are up, waaaaaaaaaaaaayyyy up(!) for the new 24 Carrots, which is setting the bar awfully high for outstanding Veg and Raw food in the southeast Valley of the Sun.

Silly me, thinking that this business owner might pay attention to yelp & surely the types of issues people were talking about would be dealt with. \n\nWell, fast forward 4 months to this past Thursday when the hubby & I finally got a chance to give this place a try. We walked in a little after 5pm to a completely empty restaurant. I tried to push aside any lingering doubts & keep an optimistic attitude. The sign said please wait to be seated but the lady behind the juice bar didn't so much as glance our way or acknowledge that we had even walked in. We started walking towards a table while asking if it would be ok to sit down. I think she grunted or something but definitely did not give a clear answer.

She continued to clean or do whatever it was she was doing behind the counter & then finally brought over some menus after close to 5 minutes. Sorry to put you out! \n\nShe took our drink orders, water with lemon for me & a sugar cane soda for hubby which she said they were out of b/c Whole Foods was out of it. Um, ok. He asked for just water with lemon too. We also ordered the Vietnamese spring rolls as a starter. I noticed that it came with a choice of dipping sauces but she never asked which one we wanted & hurried away before we could tell her. She came back with the 2 waters, no lemon. I asked for some lemon again & she came back with a tiny wedge of lemon in a filthy little bowl (pic attached) which I unfortunately didn't notice until after I had squeezed the lemon into my water :/ Then I realized we had no place settings therefore no napkins to wipe my lemon-juice covered hands on. I got her attention & asked for some napkins which she brought over, but again like I was putting her out.\n\nA couple minutes later, she came back to take our dinner order. I asked if I could have my chicken sandwich on a multi-grain bun to which she replied \"that's what it comes on\" The menu has several different bun options listed, so I'm not sure why that is the default bun for that sandwich. I guess if I had wanted another type of bun, they would have been out of it. \n\nAnother 10 minutes or so & she brought out the spring rolls with a sweet chili sauce. Still no silverware so I guess it was good it was finger-food. We asked if we could get some of the peanut sauce instead & she informed us that they don't have peanut sauce. I mentioned that I had noticed it on the menu & she said \"oh yeah, the manager is really bad about updating the menu\" Way to call out your manager! O.O\n\nWe finally got our dinners after another 20 minutes or so. Cobb salad wrap for hubby, Mediterranean grilled chicken sandwich for me. Hubby's came with 4 grapes, a tiny pickle & a pepperoncini pepper. Mine came with some mango salsa &, no joke-I counted, 7 blue corn tortilla chips. \n\nThe food itself was pretty good, albeit a little pricey for what you get. I'm glad we had the groupon!

Our waiter, JB, was a whirlwind of energy & hilarity and was one of my favorite parts of the whole place. They had karaoke videos showing during lunchtime on a Saturday, and we were encouraged to grab the mic & go for it if we wanted (we passed since there's no booze served there & that's usually the necessary precursor).

We have eaten here several times before and it has become one of our favorite restaurants in the area for the combination of its ambiance, the food, the art and it's creole influence.  The birthday meal was a custom prepared menu with wine pairings, flowers and a cake.  Monday was perfect because they weren't busy.  No live music on Monday but nice background music was playing all night.  They have a beautiful fountain by a local artist and wrought iron decor on their windows.  The pictures shown don't do justice to the decor. or the food.  Service has been attentive all the times we have been here but was especially good this night.  Our waiter was Peter and he was excellent.\n\nWe have spent some time in New Orleans and our daughter lived there for a while.  Liliana's would be right at home in the \"Big Easy.\"  The food was very good but I would mention several especially outstanding items (they may not be on regular menu).  The Asparagus Soup for the first course was very good.  The salad course  was an Arugula salad with roast walnuts and Moody Blue Cheese and a truffle v vinaigrette dressing.  It was outstanding.  The blue cheese was very smooth, the greens delightful and the dressing sublime.  I noted a previous reviewer mentioning blue cheese being overdone.  That was not the case here.  The appetizer course was a braised short rib with smoked potato puree and wilted kale with a Creole meuniere sauce.  This was more like a main entr\u00e9e.  This was the most outstanding dish.  My wife and I both agreed it was one of the best dishes we have ever had and we have eaten out at very good restaurants in many major cities for many years and are both fairly accomplished cooks.  The main entr\u00e9e was a roasted pork chop with asparagus and roasted sweet potatoes.  Ironically this was ok but probably the weakest of all the courses.  The dessert was a lemon cake which was very good.  The cake itself was very lemony with natural lemon flavor.  Only possible complaint was that the frosting was a bit greasy.\n\nThe wine pairings were very good.  We especially liked the Willow Glen Old Tawny Port  (Australian) with the desert and the \"cav\" with the Appetizer course which was  Cabernet Sauvignon Santa Florintina 2008, Famintina Valley, Argentina (not sure spellings are correct).\n\nFrom previous visits would especially recommend two desserts which are as good as I've ever had in New Orleans; the beignets which are bigger and as good or better than the Cafe Du Monde's in New Orleans (the gold standard for beignets) and the bread pudding which is gigantic (share for two) and some of the best I've ever had (and I've had a lot).\n\nWe are very fortunate to have a restaurant like this in this area.  They are relatively new and probably still learning and may make some faux pas .  I noted several negative reviews which were not my personal experience but I am sure they will achieve consistency in service and food.  They tell me many of their staff have been with them since they opened and our waiter even helped with some of the work in building the restaurant.

There's even a working fountain sculpture in the main dining area, and you'll also walk past a wall of wine on the way to your seats.  For those looking for alternate seating, there's also a full bar and two outdoor seating areas.  Tuesday through Sunday they feature live musicians, with Jazz as the most played genre.\n\nThe Cajun standards are excellent; you can't go wrong with the \u00e9touff\u00e9e, jambalaya, or gumbo - although the \u00e9touff\u00e9e is my favorite, complete with two full crawfish on top. Otherwise, their lunch, dinner and brunch menus typically change quarterly while retaining the standard dishes.  From burgers to beignets, the menu usually has a little bit of everything, and clearly labels vegetarian and spicy dishes.\n\nIn addition to their main menu, you can also try their Monday night low-calorie meals, and Monday is also Ladies Night.  And their weekly three course prix fixe menu on Tuesday nights is based on a cooking style, season, ingredient, or other theme (usually $30 per person plus optional $10 for a wine flight).\n\nI would recommend getting on their email list for the latest communications at http://www.lilianasrestaurant.com/, but they also have a Twitter and Facebook presence.\n\nMy only criticism would be that it would be nice if their tables were about two inches wider, but that can be easily remedied in the meantime as long as your server is aggressive at clearing the table.  And some other advice would be that if you're visiting during one of their super-special events that you plan for a little extra time as this might be the first time they've attempted something like it before.\n\nAnd I almost forgot to mention, they've recently begun offering take-out, which is really nice when I want some comfort food after a long day and I don't feel like making dinner.

We were repeatedly assured it would be no problem as everything is made to-order, but it was a problem and a disappointment as the great majority of  things (even on the regular menu) were not feasible and desserts were impossible (save for a mid-winter fruit plate in WI which is never a good thing).

Only ate about 1/4 of it.  The potatoes were ok, nothing special.  The greens left me with a yucky taste in my mouth, maybe too much smoky flavor.

Not only had we not seen our meals, but we also hadn't been offered drink refills. We asked our server what was going on. The first excuse was \"I'm at the whim of the executive chef.\"   Oh, so the executive chef is determining who gets food and not the order that people ordered?  Interesting. So we wait some more.  \n\nMore time goes by and we ask about our food again because now we're seeing people who came in 20-30 minutes after us paying their bill and leaving.  This time the server has no excuse or even an estimated timeline and instead offers us some drinks.  I would have even accepted a lie about what happened. And while I understand that people order different items and some things take longer than others, none of us ordered complicated menu items and that doesn't excuse having people sit for almost two hours without having their meal served to them.

We chose this restaurant for restaurant week.  Me, my gf, and her mother.  The restaurant week menu always sounded awesome, so I was excited to try it even though I was a little turned off by the restaurant week price increase - used to be $25 flat, now it's $25-$35.  Anyway... I started off with their signature bloody mary, which sounded like a unique twist on a classic - it advertised some good stuff, like Carr Valley Menage cheese, but they must have been out, because I got some cheese curds instead...  The grilled shrimp was a nice touch for a bloody, but the overall consistency of the drink was just weak and watery - for $8, you better get it right!\n\nI went all out and ordered the $35 French Quarter dinner.  Starter was a tuna nicoise salad.  Sad to say, the greens were in very poor condition, with many leaves wilted and visibly rotten - just not fresh at all.  I made the mistake of accepting the salad, and picked my way around the bad parts.  Let me just say that if a restaurant cannot even serve fresh greens, eating semi-raw tuna probably isn't a good idea.  I've got a strong stomach, so I ate it...  In hindsight, I should have sent the dish back immediately I didn't complain until the waitress came back to collect plates.  At that time, I pointed out the rotten lettuce left on my plate, and I explained that it wasn't exactly appetizing.  The waitress agreed and said she would inform the chef.  Fair enough...\n\nThe entree was something like a Gorgonzola and wild mushroom stuffed black angus rib-eye, with brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes on the side.  Sounds great, but the first thing I noticed was that the brussel sprouts were a bit undercooked...almost fresh... Not a good start.  The wild mushrooms in the steak appeared to be maybe just creminis, and of course the Gorgonzola was overpowering.  I guess I was an idiot for thinking this would be a good choice, because if you've got to stuff a cut of meat with cheese and mushrooms to make it good, it's probably not a very good cut of meat to begin with.  This was definitely true of the rib-eye; it was as tough as a cheap piece of sirloin... Damn, $35...\n\nMoving on to dessert.  This was a trio featuring creme brulee, beignets and chocolate mouse.  No complaints about the mouse, the beignets were nothing special at all, and the creme brulee is frankly, hard to mess up.  What really got me was the wilted piece of spinach that I found when I lifted the creme brulee dish off of the plate.  At that point, I almost flipped my lid because I thought the chef put it there to spite me due to my complaint about the wilted greens on the tuna nicoise.  When I confronted the waitress she explained that it was a \"gripper,\" used to keep the dish from sliding on the plate.  In any case, I thought it  out of place, very unappetizing, and a cheap idea that a better restaurant wouldn't even consider.\n\nAfter we received our check, I felt even worse seeing the $140 tab, feeling it was about a $50 experience.  Given the overall crappiness of the whole experience, I was half expecting at least my drink to be on the house...nope...  Coincidentally, the manager decided to stop by our table to ask how things were - he apparently had no idea how we felt, or he wouldn't have asked.  Well, I couldn't resist telling him how awful I thought it was - he had pretty much nothing to say, and basically just walked away without addressing the issue - he was caught totally off-guard and I hope next time he asks someone he'll be more ready to hear what they have to say - with a manager like that, I'm not surprised this place is pumping out such low quality fare.  \n\nSo...that was my dinner.  $35 plus drinks and I can honestly say I've had better at Chile's, Applebees or Red Lobster, which you can interpret as a big ol' huge slap in the face!  My companions had the same opinion.  In fact, that's how I'd classify Liliana's - they appear to want to cater to chain restaurant clientele, and they have pretty much nothing better to offer.  Madison Magazine should think twice about which restaurants they allow to be part of Restaurant Week - this should be an opportunity for the best of Madison restaurants to showcase what they have to offer, at a spectacular deal to the public - I have continually walked into restaurant week with that mindframe, and I've been continually disappointed.  Madisonians should think twice about participating in this ever declining extravaganza.  Also, do yourself a big favor and do not dine at Liliana's.\n\nThanks for your time.

Although they tasted good, I think it would be divine if they tried to do something more special than simply frying and dusting with powdered sugar. Perhaps in triangles served with a small scoop of homemade cinnamon ice cream to balance the warm benyas and their delicious crunch.\n\nSides - All main dishes came with a white bean and couscous salad with mixed herbs. It smelled wonderful and also tasted pretty good though I think the beans could have been cooked a minute longer as they were slightly tough to my liking. A nice fresh side to the heavier portion of a meal. \nNow the best most absolutely amazing part of the meal was the sweet potato crisps. They were not oily at all and just absolutely shined with sweet potato and salt flavor. Liliana's is almost worth going to just for the potato crisps!\n\nVerdict:\nWonderful atmosphere, pleasant staff, delicious food, affordable, and kid friendly.

I went vegan for about a month or so and had the pleasure of trying dishes that I would not normally not try. On this particular visit, I have to say that I was disappointed by their lack of vegan friendly options.  After scanning the menu for a bit however, I was able to find the tofu wings.  Generally, not a big fan of tofu but def a huge fan of wings so I was interested in how it would be prepared.  The presentation was sort of lacking but I don't really know what I was expecting.  On my plate came about 6 strips of tofu in buffalo sauce.  It wasn't until after I received my dish that I decided to tell the waitress that I was vegan; at that she noted that the 'wings' had actually been fried in butter.  I didn't want to make a fuss and actually offered to keep it but she was so nice and insisted that they make me another plate, this time without the butter.  I was really impressed by how helpful she was.  \n\nWhen I received my new plate, I ate the food and again, I don't really know what I was expecting but they were just okay.  Because they were advertised as wings, I was expecting a bit more texture but instead the tofu was pretty soft.   The buffalo sauce was good I guess :)  The meal wasn't all bad, the salad that I had to start was good and the date loved the etouffe that he ordered.  The table also came with cornbread which I was told was really soft and had a a great taste.\n\nMy second visit was on Valentine's Day.  This visit was also not a typical experience because there was a pre-set menu and unfortunately, none of the offerings were creole.  With that said however, I really enjoyed the meal.  There were five courses, all the same save the choice in entree.  It started out with a butternut squash soup, then salad, ravioli, and ended with a petite sirloin and chocolate mouse with strawberry.  Everything was delicious!

I'd never been to Liliana's before despite living in Madison for close to 10 years. (I know, I was shocked too). The experience was fun, overall.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice. The dining area and bar are cute.  We had a reservation and arrived a bit early. We had to wait a few minutes, but were still seated by the time our reservation was scheduled for, so it was fair.\n\nWe were seated and service initially seemed really attentive. The waiter took our drink and appetizer order, and brought the first round and appetizer out promptly. We then ordered our entrees, and I ordered a second drink. Here is where the experience started to go downhill slightly. About 15 minutes after I ordered my second drink (a glass of wine), the waiter came back to ask me what I had ordered again. I guess he forgot? I used to be a server, and I know that's easy to do when you're swamped, but he never mentioned the error. He finally brought the wine out about 45 minutes after I ordered it. If you're keeping track, you'll notice that over an hour has passed since we were initially seated, and still no entrees. Other tables seated after us were also delivered their entrees before we got ours. \n\nSo, after waiting seemingly forever for our entrees, I was disappointed when, famished, I dug into mine (jambalaya) and it was lukewarm. Again, I suspect the server was swamped and probably didn't bring it out when it was actually ready, and hot. I wouldn't write Liliana's off based on this experience alone, but a couple other reviewers note the same thing about service. Maybe they just need a couple more waiters or something. \n\nThe food was fairly average, but tasty. The jambalya would have been better if it were served hot. I actually preferred my husband's dish, the Diablo Chicken (served on grits) to mine.

This could have been my fault for coming later in the evening when the kitchen was so close to shutting down and not providing good food. Still, for a  $50 meal for two, I expect better. There was a live  jazz band playing. They were very good. It added some good ambience to the restaurant. Really enjoyed the music. Now on to the food\n\n My boyfriend and I were giving some cornbread with a honey butter as a starter from our waitress. I know corn bread and this is NOT cornbread. It tasted like Jiffy Mix batter and they added a bit more sugar. I've eaten all kinds of corn bread before, boxed cornbread, homemade cornbread even the class \"hot water\" cornbread, so I feel like I can safely say that I have a qualified taste pallet to rate  some good cornbread and this just isn't it.\n\nThe honey butter however was good. It would be proper to add it with a fresh loaf of warm bread. But I am of the belief that when you have a great piece of cornbread in front of you, you do not need to add more butter. The cornbread itself should have enough in it that all you want to do is indulge yourself into another piece. No add ons!\n\nMoving on from the cornbread, I order this blackened cash fish dinner with dirty rice and side of I believe blackeye peas with various veggies in it including (collard) greens. My rice was very hard and my blackeye peas were cold. Again, maybe it was a mistake to dine there 1 hour before closing time. My rice tasted like it may had been scrapped from the bottom of the rice cooker and the dish ended up having pork in it which I do not eat. Knowing creole food, I should have asked the waitress beforehand if pork was used in the dish ,so that is of no fault of the restaurant, however, the hard rice and cold peas are. The catfish was blackended to perfection but it lacked flavor. No salt. A pinch would have done the trick. Overall, an extremely disappointing experience and is not in my opinion New Orleans style cuisine.\n\n If you were to take this restaurant and move it to New Orleans, they wouldn't survive. Due to their location, I think they stay open simply because they have no other local competition in the area of \"creole\" cuisine and some people aren't use to either cooking this kind of food themselves or actually experiencing  food straight from New Orleans. \n\nI really do not want to be the one review that seems to go overboard but I am very opinionated about this restaurant.

But this most recent visit, on Monday, June 9, 2014 left a seriously bad taste with me.\n\n- Arrived and requested seats at the bar, where the service has typically been outstanding. Was told the bar \"is pretty much closed because of some Chef thing we're doing, I guess.\" (read that in a disinterested hostess voice)\n\n+ Was seated outside on the front patio. \n-When I inquired as to whether or not it was non-smoking, the hostess said, \"Um, I don't really know. I don't see anyone smoking right now, so my guess is not?\" \n+ She later confirmed that it was indeed, non-smoking\n\n+ Server, Jeff, arrived quickly, introduced himself, and asked about drinks. I was just in the process of checking in via the Yelp app; I set it down, inquired about the Abita taps, and ordered a Jockamo IPA. Friend ordered a Liliana's Hurricane.\n\n- Jeff disappeared for 15 minutes, only reappearing to refill the waters and to tell us that the drinks \"were almost ready.\" I asked if we could order cheese curds, as it had been 15 minutes since we sat down. He took the order and disappeared. \n\n- A few minutes later, he arrived; my beer had obviously been sitting at the bar for quite some time, as had the Hurricane - both were extremely sweaty. The ice in the hurricane was nearly completely melted. I suspect Jeff had forgotten about our drinks...\n\n- Jeff reappeared and took our food order; a catfish po boy and a burger. I asked for a side of the \"cheddar grits\" as they sounded excellent and were included with a few of the entrees. He assured me assured this was not a problem.\n\n- Cheese curds arrived and they were a mess of exploded, over-cooked, overly salty shells of vapid batter, sans any hint of cheese. We opened every single curd with a fork and knife and found zero cheese - it had all been cooked-out while in the fryer. The tempura-style batter was no match for spending too much time in the fryer. \n\n- We couldn't find Jeff to flag him down to alert him to the problem. When he did reappear, I asked him to swing by and explained to him the problem with the curds. He said he'd get a new order. My beer was empty at this point, as was my water, but he was gone so quickly, I didn't have a chance to order a refill.\n\n- I also feared that the new curds would arrive at exactly the same time as the entrees... and, my fear was confirmed. Out came the curds, followed by the entrees. Before Jeff could turn around to bolt away, I asked for another beer, and also asked for the wifi password. This seemed to confuse Jeff; he wasn't sure if they had wifi. When I showed him the \"Liliana's Guest\" wifi network, he said he'd be back with the password...\n\n+ Burger was superb. Perfectly cooked, nicely seasoned, fresh greens, tasty bleu cheese, and a great bun.\n\n- The cheddar grits were anything but grits. They came out in a fried and formed cake-like shape, resembling more of a crab cake than creamy cheddary grits. I cut into the grits and found no semblance of anything grit - it was like a cheesy hash brown. I'm fairly certain grits don't contain chunks of onion and potato.\n\n+ Catfish Po Boy was excellent - perfectly cooked catfish, nicely seasoned, tasty slaw, and a hearty, yet not-overwhleming bun. The accompanying side of white bean salad consisted primarily of couscous, pesto, and garlic. Only a few white beans were found.\n\n- The second attempt of curds were slightly less blown-out, but they were completely devoid of any \"cajun\" seasoning (they're sold as Cajun Cheese Curds). Instead, they were terribly salty, greasy, and just not good at all. My friend observed that they tasted like \"carnival fair batter\" - sweet, and overly salty. \n\n- Never saw Jeff again. He didn't bring the password, he didn't follow-up on the meal, and he didn't drop off the check. After sitting for 20 minutes or so, staring helplessly at the restaurant, we got up and went to the bar to grab our check. The table next to us did the same thing; they had a similar service nightmare...\n\n$60 for a truly unmemorable meal and an even more forgetful experience (literally). \n\nThe maddening part was that I saw Chef Dave sitting in the bar, at a long table, surrounded by other chef-types. They were talking about the service industry... as I walked out, the hostess didn't bother to lift her head from her phone - she was busy tapping away on the screen.\n\nUgh.

At that moment the owner came out and insisted that we come in. After some back and forth we decided to take them up on their offer. This says a lot to me about their service. So often you run into situations where you feel rushed by the wait staff so this was a nice change. We felt guilty but they kept insisting that they were going to be around for another hour anyways.\n\nThe restaurant does in fact have two sisters running it in the kitchen. They do a great job because we thoroughly enjoyed our Massaman Curry, Thai Fried Rice and Egg Rolls. All of it was delicious. We are pretty avid Thai Food eaters and we've yet to find a solid one by our place in Cave Creek/Moon Valley Area. We're glad to report that we have found that place. For a long time we were stuck with Pete's Thai which was awesome the first time we had it, but after 3 or 4 more times of ordering the same thing but getting completely different results, we've since given up.\n\nTwo Sisters does the 1 to 10 spice level like many Thai Restaurants do and they seem to have it down pretty well. As in 5 is medium and 7-10 are pretty spicy. I like mine around 6 or 7. If you're unsure, they'll happily give you some extra peppers so you can spice it up further to your discretion.\n\nWe've been back 2 more times so far and still love it!

Better yet is their massaman curry with chicken, the stir- fried seafood and their excellent pad thai with vegetables. \n\nSpicing is based on 1-5 level of heat.

The pad thai was perfect - lots of noodles and lots of vegetables that still had a bit of crunch to them. Chopped peanuts for the topping were served separately.\n\nPortions were generous and came with steamed rice.

Having recently discovered this lovely treat, the words \"stuffed french toast\" had me salivating.\n\nI was actually up early enough this past weekend to enjoy a nice brunch, so the BF and I headed to The Maple Tree.  Imagine my surprise when we pulled up into this tiny strip mall.  We pass by this area all the time and have never even noticed the place; it's definitely a hidden gem!\n\nWalking in around noon, there's a steady stream of customers with a few empty tables.  We're seated immediately and I'm in search of the stuffed French toast.  Our waitress, Karen, comes by to take our beverage orders and she soon learns that it's our first time.  She gave us a bunch of great recommendations from across the menu, which cemented our choice for brunch.  The BF already saw their version of the Monte Cristo and with Karen's suggestion, he was easily sold.  I was tempted with the stuffed French toast or one of their skillets, but Karen sold me on the crab cakes.\n\nWe were anxiously awaiting our orders and I noticed immediately that two of the diners next to us also got the crab cakes!  \"The New England Benny\" (Two crab cakes, served on English muffin halves, topped with two poached eggs and hollandaise sauce, served with country potatoes. $9.25) soon arrived as well as the BF's \"The Maple Tree Monte Cristo\" (A French Toast sandwich with thinly shaved ham, turkey, and Swiss cheese, deep fried to a golden brown, dusted with powdered sugar and served with pure maple syrup or raspberry puree. $8.95).\n\nSince the Monte Cristo comes with either maple syrup or raspberry puree, the BF paid the extra $1.25 to get both sauces.  It also came with a side of fresh fruit with is nice complement to this hearty meal.  He preferred the raspberry puree over the syrup in the end, and he ate it all.  It was a nice cross of sweet and salty at the same time for me, and the BF really appreciated that the ham they used was salty enough for the contrast.  He finished off his entire meal.\n\nI don't usually order Eggs Benedict or anything with hollandaise sauce for that matter, but the crab cakes was what got me!  And it was definitely delicious!  Karen told us the crab cakes are homemade and you definitely get the taste of crab, not a bunch of stuffing.  They also add spices that give it a nice kick.  My plate was licked clean!  The BF said the next time we eat here, he's going to get my dish because he liked it over his Monte Cristo!\n\nService was great too!  The waitresses are constantly walking around refilling coffee mugs and water glasses. You probably won't see them standing by the side gossiping because they really work!  And everyone is super-friendly too!  Other waitresses had heard the BF was getting the Monte Cristo and asked him what he thought of it.  We also overheard other waitresses with the other customers and they really try to make you feel at home, especially if it's your first time at The Maple Tree.  And dishes are cleared quickly too!  \n\nOverall, The Maple Tree is a great place for breakfast, brunch and lunch.  Not only will you see your staple breakfast items, but you'll find Fish N Chips, Tuna Melts, Salads, Sandwiches, Burgers, Roasted Chicken, Baked Ham, and other goodies on the menu.

It's definitely styled like a little country cafe with fake flowers, wooden tables, random pictures hanging on the walls, and little trinkets on the shelves.

I know lots of people don't like when things are smothered in sauce, but I do (depending on what kind of sauce). Some of the country potatoes were a little burnt around the edges, but I like crunchy potatoes, so I can't complain about that either. \n\nMy mom's Frita looked pretty tasty, but I didn't try any of it. It was served in a little skillet and the first thing my mom said when she took a bite was, \"Oh, it's pretty good!\" My dad's plate came with two Huevos Rancheros served on tostadas, rice, and beans. The rice looked like they tried to serve it in a small ball, but it must've fell apart and the beans had cheese on top, but it wasn't melted at all. I'm sure they put the cheese on top of the beans right before they brought it out though because I remember hearing one of the chef's saying, \"No, the cheese on the beans. The cheese needs to go on top of the beans!\" The apple fritter I ordered with my meal was pretty tasty...on the inside. The outside was a little too sweet for my taste since it was fried and covered in glaze. \n\nOverall, I would consider this place to be a local gem. A lot of the food is pretty heavy, but they also have a \"lighter fare\" section on the menu, so you don't have to force your buttons to explode. The prices are also decent.

I saw pics of what it used to look like and I loved the new decor and look of the place. The outside needs updating and they are in a pretty awful looking plaza on the corner of Spring Mountain and Jones. We were seated right away as it was not very busy, I guess they have never been a dinner spot so this is all new to them... and it showed.\n\nBefore I get into food... the service needs work. They need to pay attention and listen when orders are placed and they should really take the time to learn the new menu... I understand its only a day but you don't know if there is sauce on the burger or not? The funniest moment came when one of the busser girls walked by and asked if I would like a refill on my soda (that I hadn't even ordered but was brought to me anyway). I said no thank you I'm ok, so she asked if she could take the glass... there was still a good amount of soda in it! I kind of looked at her confused and said no I would like to finish that. The biggest negative for service for me was that they had way too many staff there (not sure if this was because of  the show) but their servers and hosts were all huddled up by the hostess stand talking at the front of the restaurant. Even one of the girls that looked like she might be a manager or something was there as well.\n\nOn to the food... I was pretty surprised that for a place known for its breakfast food that they now have a full dinner menu (created by Robert Irvine I'm sure) but not what we were expecting at all. Was actually a bit disappointed because I was hoping for breakfast food. I ordered the burger ($10 w/ bacon added) and my girlfriend ordered the steak ($14). The steak was a \"baseball cut\" and had good flavor but wasn't a great cut of meat. The $10 filet at Firefly is a much better buy. The burger (beef/short rib) that the waitress asked if \"medium-well\" was ok came out well done. I'm pretty sure it was supposed to have cheese according to the menu and I don't eat tomatoes but they were pretty ugly looking tomatoes. The saving grace of the burger was the awesome thick cut bacon on top! Delicious! The fries had the look and taste of store bought frozen fries, but I could be wrong.\n\nI believe that with a few minor changes this place could do better!

The steak is advertised on the menu as pan fried and I thought it was pan fried but the chef who I talked to later said it was deep fried. The steak was thick and breaded just right.  The seasoning was good.  The hash browns were crispy and seasoned good.  You can tell the potatoes were turning color before they were cooked.  Maybe they can find a way to stop the color change.  The white sausage gravy was good too.  I thought this was one of the best CFS I have had.  I talked to the chef later to recommend putting the steak on top of the gravy to present the crispy golden brown steak instead of smothering it with gravy.

However, it was worth it.  Almost everything was amazing.  The bacon was a bit singed, the steak and gravy a bit dry, and the GF Red Velvet waffles were also dry.  Otherwise, I thought that everything else was pretty tasty.  The salad was delicious (love a good salad), potatoes were pretty good, the omelet was so huge that I was thankful we were sharing.  Soooooo good.  We devoured the pancakes in less than five minutes.  I guess the fact that the decor was (as other Yelpers so eloquently put it) straight out of the 70s and the service was a bit slow, but otherwise, I enjoyed my meal.

They cooked the steak medium (per Jude's instructions) and it was pretty juicy/tasty.  The bacon was definitely more on the crispy side, instead of being burnt.  They definitely made the omelet the way I wanted it, egg whites vs. regular eggs, and triple checked to see that we wanted the Gluten Free Red Velvet pancakes, which were phenomenal.  Zero complaints, for sure.  I liked that they were pretty attentive, chatty, and were more than willing to sub in gluten free pancakes for the regular ones, in case we chose to do so, since that's one of their new check in deals.\n\nAll in all, I'll be coming back.  The location is definitely what is killing them, since they're surrounded by so many other food choices in Chinatown.

The group I was with are pretty healthy health conscious so I thought they may enjoy Indian food done healthy...\n\nWe shared the chickpea ceviche as an appetizer and then most of us ordered the different rice bowls as entrees.  We had fun with the variety of sauces too.  Favorite choices included the cauliflower, eggplant, chicken tikka masala, and veggie tofu tikka as well as the mint, hot, and curry sauces.  Unfortunately, Marc is allergic to onions and everything he attempted to order had onions in it.  By the time he placed an order for plain chicken and rice, we were all almost done and the kitchen was slammed and didn't prioritize his order (as they should have).  So, Marc didn't eat.  :(\n\nI will return for sure for the food - it's prepared for the health conscious eater and it is not as heavy as traditional Indian Food - I happen to like that!

The potato filling was nicely spiced  but that still didn't make up for the soft exterior.\n\nThe Chickpea Ceviche - a grander name for the Indian street snack Bhel Puri on the other hand would have benefited from more spices.  The Pappadums that are offered with it is a nice crispy contrast to the cool and tangy combination of chickpeas, cucumbers, tamarind, mint and coriander.\n\nNot sure why I ordered the Seared Scallops in landlocked Phoenix.  I still remember Spike on Top Chef this season madly drying his frozen scallops and still did not manage get the crispy outer sear on his scallops.  Similarly these had a nice dark sear but the exterior was not in the least bit crispy.  The veggie skewer accompanying it had nice smokiness from being chargrilled.\n\nThe lamb chops or more appropriately lamb lollipops on the other hand was overly spiced.  We wish it was served with some starch or even a few slices of cucumber for contrast.\n\nA great alternative to the usually heavy Indian food.

The inside space would have probably been better used to put in a few industrial juicers and utilized for prep space.  I've had a couple of juices made there a la carte and the first time the wait was way too long, (my Jack Lalanne works faster), and the next time the girl behind the counter told me she had to ask permission to make my juice because there were two...TWO...other customers in the whole place, who had just placed an order.  I told her not to worry about it and walked out.  \n\nI just went over there to give them another try before solidifying my opinion, because every place has an off day, but this time the cook or manager had to get up from his laptop and get someone out of the back to ring me up.  He said he didn't know how to use the register.  The place was totally empty with 3 people working, and I had to wait to get rung up. The two employees \"working\" the register area were in the back gabbing it up.  Maybe just another off day? Dunno.  \n\nIn my opinion, if Nourish concentrated solely on being a juice and salad joint, kind of like Grab a Green in Scottsdale, or Inta Juice in Chandler, they'd probably be much busier- and if they got some visibility from the main roadway that would help too.  I'm afraid this place might not make it long, short of someone like Marcus from the Profit coming in to revamp things a little.

It's been a couple of years since I've last been to Malee's but I'm certain that it was a romantic, dimly lit, comfortable quiet restaurant.  Something of a treat.  \n\nUnfortunately, this location didn't resemble Desert Ridge in the slightest. The dining room area to our left was fairly small, and noisy and well lit.  The atmosphere: rather casual.  My friends and I definitely felt out of place, and way overdressed for a Saturday night.   The tables felt crowded with plates and silverware already pre-served, which was kind of annoying because when our dishes came out, we were asked if we wanted to eat from the plate it came on, or if wanted to transfer our food onto the plates provided on the table.   Doesn't make sense.  We stuck with the plates the food was served on.  \n\nOn to the menu:  Another thing I seem to remember at the Desert Ridge Location, they offered Sushi.  There was no menu for Sushi at this location.  Was it that they just didn't provide a sushi menu unless asked for?  Or do they just don't serve it all?  I suppose, if they don't advertise it, it's probably best to just avoid the question all together.   Just a guess. \n\nI ordered the grilled chicken over spinach dish, mild.  Now this may or may not be worth noting, but I don't think my watch lapsed a full 5 minutes before we were served with our food.  This is wonderful, when you're at a fast food joint like Mc D's, but at a Thai restaurant?  I'm not so sure how I feel about that.  \n\nBy the way, Mild stands for : no kick to it at all.  Don't be scared to go with the medium.  Take it from someone who is a baby when it comes to hot spicey foods!\n\nOn to the great part: 3 dishes, 2 glasses of wine, 1 vodka Stoli: $62.00.  Nice.  \n\nI wish I liked this place better, I really do.  Unfortunately, it's just no the Malee's I know and loved at Desert Ridge.

Their service is always amazing, and their people are always friendly. It's a place where being a regular is pretty easy because the staff will remember you after a couple of visits. \n\nMalee's makes it no secret that they're not going after the traditional Thai dishes, as they add their own flare and ingredients as they see fit. What's really great about this stance, is that they'll make the dishes how YOU see fit. I went in one time and ordered the Hippy Noodles (vegetarian), but since I'm a carnivore, and cannot have a meal without meat, I had them substitute Duck for the Tofu. It was delicious! You can order small portions, various degrees of spice (personally, I'm a wuss, so I keep things mild), substitutions, wine pairings, the whole nine. A truly unique dining experience in the way they approach their customers.\n\nI liked this place so much, and my girlfriend loves it more than I do even, that for her birthday, I got us in for one of their cooking classes they offer every month or two.  The owner, GM and head chef put on the class in one of the side dining areas, tought us the intricacies of their dishes (though most of the class was spent hearing the stories from customer tales, food-related trips around the world and other fun quips) and also what Malee's is about.  After the instructional portion (and several glasses of Champagne) we then moved to the bar-area and proceeded to partake in dining on the dishes we just learned about, with a fantastic wine-pairing put on by one of their bartenders.  Mind you, I thought that wine-pairing stuff was a load of hooey, but it really was fantastic.\n\nMalee's is fantastic, and I will continue to go there for as long as I can, and will miss if for the times that I cannot get there.

The tables that crowd the tiny space make the environment seem too cramped, and an intimate night out might be shared with the couple at the table next to you.\nSit at the bar, where you are always waited on promptly, the bar tenders are quite knowledgeable, have time to discuss the art of being alive, and can whip up some delectable treats before you receive your fare.  My personal favorite beverage is the Thai Iced Tea.  Though non-alcohlic, it is delicious and complements any of the foods well. Ask the bartenders or servers about the wine list, often they carry imported beer from Italy as well.\nI will start by saying I have not tasted everything on the menu,  but i do know what i will order again and again. \nIf you are new to Thai food, an absolute must is the \"Tom Ka Gai\" soup.  A serving ideal for a party of three, it is a divine hot and sour interpretation with coconut milk, mushrooms, cilantro, lemongrass, galangal root, and kaffir lime.  It can be ordered with any meats, tofu, or just plain.  I recommend it with all white chicken, and at a number 2.  If you are unsure about how spicy you want your Thai food, remember that 1 is not spicy, and 5 (the highest) will probably burn offyour taste buds.  Perhaps you like spicy, but also note that too much spice will overpower the complexity of your foods.\nIf you want an assortment of various appetizers, try the Combination plate which includes Spring rolls, Satay, (marinated chicken tenders with cucumber and peanut sauces, and my favorite!) Thai Toast, (flash fried toast points filled with garlic and chicken, not my favorite) Crab Rangoon, (delicious flash-fried puffs of crab and cream cheese served with thai sauces) Siamese Kisses,  (chicken and shrimp in steamed shumai wraps topped with scallions and crispy garlic) and Potstickers.  \nAll come with an assortment of sauces, and if your eyes are larger than your belly, then you will likely have no room left for the divine main courses.\nQuite frankly, I have never tried any of the house favorites, except the Pad Thai.  And if Pad Thai is all you know, I recommend you venture out this time and wrap your lips around some of the sweetest, most delicious curries this side of the West\nI am not a fan of vegetables, which is something one finds an overabundance of in Thai dishes...but not if you order the \"Burma Gai.\"  Flat noodles and chicken in a yellow curry with coconut milk with titillate and tantalize.  You can substitute, add, or remove anything in any one of the entrees, so you can basically customize your entrees.\nIf you like something with a little more pizazz, do the \"Drunken Dragon Noodles\" or \"The Evil Jungle Princess.\"  Another curry dish, the Dragon, has rice noodles smothered with a wild green curry sauce, topped with chicken, basil, and onion. Again, if you are not a fan of the spicy, go very easy on this one.  Better yet is the Princess, which has a lovely coconut sauce with hints of mint, and two simple additions of chicken and straw mushrooms.  Though I prefer chicken or nothing at all, the Green Basil Curry with Pork is another incredible curry with coconut and various veggies.\nYou will also have a selection of seafood dishes, as well as specialty sushi rolls and vegetarian preparations.  Remember that the sauces here are the key, all dishes are served with rice, all ingredients can be removed or substituted, and if you really want to taste the diverse flavors, don't make your dish too spicy.\nDon't be shy to ask, as all the waitstaff here is very knowledgable, and even if you are new to Thai, or a veteran, they can assist you in making the perfect choice.\nShould you have room for dessert at the end of your robust meal, a must is the traditional Thai favorite, Sticky Coconut Rice with fresh mangos. Not heavy enough to warrant a wheelbarrow for the ride home, but sticky and sweet enough to make you feel like a kid again.\nIn short, I love this place!

The four of us decided on Thai & our friend that was driving mentioned Malee's.  We all agreed to give it a try after we realized that the other mentioned options were closed on Sunday evening.\n\nTo start, Malee's atmosphere was not bad.  The dinning room was clean (or seemed so) & was well decorated for a Thai restaurant.  The service was marginal...  Our server proceeded to explain all of the specials, all of which he pretty much said were not good.  Pretty strange, but I always appreciate the honesty, but needless to say, we ordered off of their regular menu.\n\nThe food...  The food was OK, nothing special.  I absolutely LOVE great Thai food, however, this was not much better than what you would be served at a Chinese restaurant.

Amongst the rice was a \"friend\" looking up at me, a COCKROACH.  Although I am vegetarian, the fact that an animal was in the rice did not freak me out.  Cockroaches, however are not a sign of cleanliness in a restaurant.  I already had my concerns after visiting the restroom to wash my hands before dinner, what a freaking mess!  But that's another show...\n\nAfter finding the cockroach in the rice, I brought this to the server's attention, trying not to make a scene & upset my friends who had all already eaten from the rice bowl.  I requested a fresh bowl of rice & explained the problem.  He saw it & agreed to bring a new bowl, which he did shortly thereafter.  \n\nOne big problem that I have with Malee's is that we did not receive any sort of apology for being served a COCKROACH in our rice.  I was not looking for a free dinner, but an apology was in order for such a disgusting situation from both the server & a manager/owner would have been nice.  Obviously the server & or management did not care that they served us a COCKROACH in our food.  Obviously the management/owners DO NOT CARE about sanitation.  Obviously the management/owners DO NOT CARE about their customers health & well-being as long as they get their money.\n\nNeedless to say, I will never go back here again.

The way this dish was made lacked all of those 3 features but the sustitution by the ripe mangos solved that issue and gave it the flavor that it need. By design, I expected that was the intention of this Americanized dish: the individual ingredients thrown in separately and not blended in until it softened, stripped away the traditional spice and saucy elemental aspects of it and you  have something different for a change that the mostly non-minority American diners would enjoy.

It had to because , for example, you can't throw preserve fish sauce into these dishes like you would in an authentic Thai restaurant that would fume the whole place.

The atmosphere is much nicer than many other Thai restaurants that I've been to and the curry can't be beaten.  My favorite is the Arizona Heatwave, which I typically order \"very spicy\" with tofu.  To translate, \"very spicy\" at Malee's means that there's good flavor and spice for someone who typically likes spicier food without being so overpowering that one's mouth is simply burning so badly that the actual flavors of the food are masked.  The dinner portion is definitely quite a bit larger than the lunch portion, so if you're looking to take leftovers home, you'll want the larger size.  The tofu spinach pot stickers are also a great appetizer and are served with a variety of tasty dipping sauces.  The only real negative that I've encountered food-wise is the peanut dressing that comes on the salads by default.  It's so heavy and the salad is just drowning in dressing to the point that it's impossible to taste the salad itself.  That problem is easily remedied, however, by asking for the sesame ginger dressing which is much lighter.\n\nWhile I've never attended, Malee's offers cooking classes once a month at which they provide instruction on how to make some of their signature dishes.

Malees was the worst strike-out of them all.\n\nMy first clue should have been when the girl asked \"How spicy?\"  I replied with \"3\", as every Thai restaurant I've been to does a scale of 1 to 5.  She responded with an awkward silence and then \"... So really hot?\"   No... no... just no. \n\nWe had the appetizer platter, which was 6 different things that all tasted the same, save for the crab rangoons, the crispy pla and the evil jungle princess. The fish candy was blah. The crispy pla, as someone already mentioned in another review, tasted like nothing whatsoever, and the sauce was overly sweet; I thought I'd need an insulin shot after 2 bites. The evil jungle princess is one of my favorite dishes, but this one was just not right. It was like they had dumped chili powder into it. Chili powder does not go in Thai food. Do not want. It did NOT mix in with the curry and just burned the s*** out of my tongue. The rice was also very dry.\n\nThe bill for this \"Oh let's just get Thai takeout\" evening came out to $49. $49 for freaking take-out for 2 people. I was kind of shell-shocked; I had added it up at home and it shouldn't have been that much.... but me not wanting to cause a scene, I just paid it. I don't know if they accidentally did \"large\" portions, but they looked normal sized to me. \nBut Jesus Christ, I can pay $25 for two people and get amaaaazing Thai food, so $49 for this lame excuse for Thai was not acceptable.

For every special occasion I prefer Malee's over Flemming's, Mastros, Ruth's and even after opening out precious Roy's of Scottsdale (I know it's gone from Scottsdale..sad) I prefer it over all. \nWe always have the same but when we take guest I enjoy seeing of anyone else will want to try something new I haven't tried. \nI order off the old menu since I'm \"ancient\" and the new menu confuses me. I remember the old menu had so many items tho that I'm sure it makes things much easier to have slimmed down the deliciousness to the best. \nFirst we have the Summer Rolls served with plum sauce and peanut sauce and I always ask for some siraca since I like it spicy. They are such a treat since AZ is so hot in the summer and it's served cool. In other words this is a fresh summer roll and not \"fried\" so please don't get confused ..it's not a spring roll. It's has ingredients such as fresh basil and I believe you can do chicken or shrimp ..or both? Idk.. All I know is they're BOMB and my mouth is watering so ....in to the second course. \nNext is my favorite dish and I confess I have come to get this item as takeout  TOO MANY TIMES TO COUNT!!!! It's amazing and still to this day THE BEST SOUP I HAVE EVER...EVER HAD!!! \nTom Yum soup seafood combination is simply to dies for! Oh Deirdre  Sweet beautiful Deirdre  one day please open up in Ca! You would make so many people sooooo happy!! I just can't tell you how amazing this soup is...you will need to try it yourself! AND WHEN YOU DO... You will thank me a million times over (by buying me some Tom Yum) . One thing I have to say is I do sometimes take out the squid (my aunt doesn't like the texture..but I say hand it over... And the root that looks like wood haha... Yeh... Don't eat that. It's so flavorful that I'm sure that and the cilantro and fresh lemongrass are some of the fine ingredients that being this dish to my all time faves. Seriously! You will crave this soup and pick it up just by its self for dinner!! \nFor the main dishes we usually keep it family style and have what use to be called the \"00\" (double zero), now referred to as the Arizona Heatwave. It's a delicious ed curry that is simply the only red curry that I ever order. Here in Cali I have to stick to the yellow curry. Her red curry is such an amazing distinct flavor of richness that it's just incomparable to others. I don't know what she does but I've tried it everywhere along with the soup and nah.... Never ever the same. I do order this dish without coconut milk. Still want brothy creamy texture but the coconut milk for me is a nah. It's served with all sorts of veggies from carrots, broccoli to baby corn and celery. Oh man this review...can you tell I'm in love with this place? Ok so quickly I'll tell ya the other couple entrees we have when in a group is the Pad Thai noodles (yumm) and the Crispy Pla White Fish... (Double Yumm). Both are just delectable dishes that beat other Thai restaurants by a mile shot! \nNow that I have mentioned the food ui know you want to go... Now I must tell you to make a reservation please. The front desk staff is always sweet and I believe his name is Jon? Just a breath of fresh air this handsome devil. So sweet and even tho it seems I have seen him over half my life we probably have never spoken more than a couple words. Hope he knows he is a gem to the restaurant. I mean I always look for him and of course beautiful Deirdre. You can't miss her. She's the gorgeous blond whoa presence demands your attention when walking through the room. (If course when I'm with my gorgeous aunt Diane Dillard...you can't miss that beauty two). Woah.. Those two in the same room... Watch out Scottsdale!  \nI have to mention one last thing that is always such a treat and so unique.. When served the check you receive a cool treat of white chocolate served in what I imagine as a type of husk from maybe corn or bamboo?

She ordered a Mandarin chicken and as soon as they put it down I could see that she wasn't going to like it as she eats a lot with her eyes and not her mouth. Sure enough she tried it and didn't like it is that orange peel gives off kind of a burnt taste. That's all her and her pickiness because I tried it and I thought it was fantastic don't judge her lack of taste. The server is gracious enough to bring her a replacement plate of teriyaki chicken. They put a rush on the order came out rather quickly and that chicken was absolutely out of this world. It was cooked crispy perfectly and seasoned wonderfully. She said it was the best teriyaki chicken she's ever had. I agree with her.\n\nI had a seafood curry that had scallops and shrimp, call Mari, muscles and fish it was served in a spicy red curry sauce.

I had a drink called the fusion which was the perfect blend of berries, watermelon and vodka. It was not overly sweet.

The yellow tail appetizer was also good but you can find the same at alot of other sushi places around town. \nNow for the Sashimi. Their pieces we cut quite a bit larger than most sushi places but also not cut through all the way so you end up with a huge hunk of fish. We did mention it to the waitress.

I went with a group of 7 friends on opening day and we were able to get a reservation simply based on our positions at various hotels around the valley, and saw a 30 minute wait after our 8:30PM reservation, which was ok seeing as they squoze us in. When I pulled up, I was amazed at all the vehicles in the valet lot, so I kept driving and parked around the corner. The place made me feel small from the beginning!\n\nThe entire space is beautiful and very well done. It's hip, yet upscale, and a very fun atmosphere. The servers are very friendly even though some of them are not fully trained in the restaurant. The food I had was delicous. Tuna on fried brown rice cake was delicious, as was the salmon and toro sushi. The yakatori sticks were very bland and almost seemed as though they were done with a greek seasoning, rather than a sweet Japanese. The food did come out quickly, even on a day when the place was packed way over capacity. Drinks, however, were not so quick. I had 2 greyhounds @ 14 each and I swear neither of them had any alcohol in them and have heard similar grumblings from others as well. I have to assume their bartenders have previous experience from other places, but it didn't seem as such. I heard a LOT of smashed glasses as well. The whole night seemed like a mess for them.\n\nThe restrooms were very cool, if not a bit confusing. They told me to go in through the door to the restrooms and I saw a lot of women standing around and figured I was headed for the womens room. But infact the men and women share the communal sinks and waiting areas, but have their own bathroom area, which was different. I feel the atmosphere was definitely typical Scottsdale but a little different in some areas where it was obvoius they put some neat touches in it. \n\nI had one major gripe with the place, a little out of the restaurants control, was the overzealous attitude of their loss prevention department. These guys thought they were professional bouncers at Las Vegas night clubs.  We had been going back and forth between the restaurant and the lobby all night with no problems. At one point a big black guy said I cant come in, and this was after my whole party just went in front of me. I said \"look count chocula, I've been in here all night, and all of my friends just walked by you. Don't stand there and tell me your hands are tied or you are over capicaty or something like that, because I know it is bs. I'm going past you.\" His co-worker came over and told him to let me in. The guy would have beat  me into the ground if he had wanted to but it worked out. \n\nThey need to get their security department going in a proper fashion, and work on the bar quite a bit, and the place will be a real winner.

It was only the second weekend they have been open so considering we had to wait an hour for our reservation wasn't so bad because the whole world seemed to be there so talking to everyone made the time pass quickly.  I didn't even think I was in Scottsdale.  Just watching the crowded scene at Sushi Roku and the W Hotel was enough to keep anyone occupied.  They offered us the sushi bar at one point but we opted to wait for a table since it was more of where the action seemed to be.  We got our table and instantly started eating because 1. The table sitting next to us starting sharing their sweet potato chips with us and 2. They brought us edamame without us even ordering it (that scores huge with me)!  At this point since we had waited for a while we weren't starving so we ordered the baked lobster roll and the yellowtail sashimi with diced chilies.  I was hesitant about ordering the lobster roll because I thought it would be heavy and it was actually the opposite - very light.  The yellowtail was so unbelievable I could eat it everyday, all day.  Now the table on the other side of us starting sharing their filet mignon wrapped in asparagus which was very tasty.  They also started pouring us their sake as well which was great!  The ahi tuna carpaccio arrived compliments of the owner as well as a dessert.  All of the desserts sounded so good we told our waitress to surprise us.  She brought some type of egg rolls with ice cream but we were too full to eat them so we reciprocated and gave them to the table next to us.  Our waitress for a new restaurant was perfect.  She was nice, friendly and knowledgeable.  The owner came to sit with us as we were finishing up and was asking ideas of where to possibly open a Boa Steakhouse (also one of LA's amazing restaurants that Innovative Dining Group owns).  I was so excited and told him that Scottsdale Quarter would be the perfect place for Boa.  Now we started our venture to the W Hotel Pool Bar.

I had a mushroom tofu steak and a fairly delish dessert. It was all very good. The seaweed salad was good but loud. Yes, very loud in my head.

All the fish was very fresh, and as good as you can get in Phoenix, unless you're a regular somewhere else and get the special stuff. My benchmark for this is 'saba'. Usually, if you're not a regular somewhere, you get the dried out, pickled-herring tasting stuff. But Roku sent out the good stuff. Moist and delicious.\n\nThe sushi rice was excellent. Some of the portions were a bit awkward, with the rice ball minimized maybe to make the top portion seem larger...? But very good. I would sit at the bar next time.\n\nThe hot and cold plates were of the standard \"inventive new japanese\" type, but very well executed.\n\n\nTHE OKAY (aka: the bar)\nDecent selection of beers and sake. Some frou frou specialty cocktails. But if you can't make a Vodka Tonic, you're fired. That wasn't tonic. Sent it back, came back again. Not tonic. 1 of 3 things going on here:\n\n1) waitress screwed up twice (doubtful, she seemed competent and sober)\n2) bartender screwed up twice\n3) tonic is on tap, and tap was screwed up and only delivering carbonation and no syrup. if so, the bartender isn't checking the taps - see #2 above.\n\nI like a Vodka Soda too, so I let it slide and didn't send it back again.\n\n\nTHE UGLY (aka: the overal l experience)\nNormally, a W hotel is a chill spot in every city.

The only thing louder was the table of seemingly underage rich kids getting hammered for someone's 19th birthday. \"We're bombin, dude!\" I think \"bombin\" means ruining both your sake and beer by mixing them in the same glass. The table was out of control and acted like they were at a Super Sweet 16, but were not approached by mgmt, as far as we could see. \n\nElsewhere, cougars on the prowl. Some horrified rich people. And some troubled foodies.\n\n\nOVERALL\nThe food was very good . The experience was pretty cheesy. Some of the staff must find it hard not to chuckle when they're trying to prepare and serve A+ dishes. They need to tone it down to keep a return business. The sake bomber crowd isn't gonna keep coming back at $100/head, and fine diners don't want their conversations (and even thoughts) drowned out by Vegas theatrics, unnecessary \"security\" and obnoxious guests.

It's a total scene, with well dressed, beautiful people jockeying for position and pulling every string they can to bypass the line, get seated immediately, etc. etc. So, my advice to people is to know what you're getting into.....go with the right mindset....and enjoy yourself, because it's quite a show! \n\nThere are two different atmospheres to Roku, so you DO have a choice. The main dining room is fun, loud, and buzzing with activity. This is where all the action is. The only thing is, don't anticipate a deep, meaningful conversation with your dining companions. Yell some small talk, sip your drink, and enjoy the food!\n\nThe upstairs open patio is another story. While it definitely doesn't have the buzz of the main room, it is filled with large booths and tables, overlooking the W's pool deck. This is a MUCH more tranquil experience, allowing you to enjoy your conversation without straining or yelling. \n\nThe food is very good. And, for what they charge, it should be. It took me back to the couple of times I've been to Nobu........some of the best sushi I've ever had......some of the largest dinner tabs I've ever had, as well. \n\nThe appetizer selection is large and there are daily specials. On our last trip we tried a Tuna Tartar special, as well as their \"Hanabi\" Spicy Tuna on Crispy Rice Cakes. Both are excellent. For dinner, we stuck to rolls, focusing on items such as Tako Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, and Katana Roll....all involving the adjective \"spicy\"....what can I say? We like it spicy. \n\nOn a previous visit, some main courses hit the table. The Chilean Sea Bass was excellent, so don't be afraid to order off the Entree Menu if sushi isn't your thing. \n\nLastly, the service is wonderful. We've been twice and everyone has been great to us. You are never left wondering where your server has gone and their GM, Seth, and the other managers are constantly making the rounds and ensuring that everything is to your liking. \n\nAll in all, I'm a fan of Roku.

For a busy Saturday night, you would think that they would have enough people to handle all of the people that were at this restaurant. The bar was super slow, the sushi bar was well slow. Let's just say everyone else in our party of 40 were almost finished with their sushi by the time myself and another young lady finally got ours. Yes again , it was good, but wow, it took a very long time. We only had three rolls between the two of us. \n\nSo don't got with a party larger than 6 max! I watched other tables with smaller parties get their food and drinks at record speed so size does matter in this situation. If you go, go early before it gets too busy so that you won't wait for your food or your drinks. Oh and it is a little pricey so be warned. I have no problem paying for good food, as long as the service is just as good.

I don't fancy myself a vegetarian, but I have never been so delighted eating a plate of straight veggies.\n\nTuna Tartar ($6). If you like raw tuna and avocado, this dish will melt your taste buds. Don't let the ugly name fool you. This is a beautiful dish with a beautiful taste.\n\nOysters ($2.5 each). These oysters have more flavor that most any other oyster I've swallowed. They have a garnish of Asian citrus flavors which subtly mask the true oceanic taste of the oyster, so if you are looking for the traditional unadulterated oysters, these may not be the ones for you.\n\nOn a side note, kudos to the staff. The servers, bartenders, and managers, are extremely accommodating, helpful, and very friendly.

The nori they use here is of the best quality - it crackles when you bite into it, but does not shatter.\n\nEel and avocado hand roll - \u00dcber-rich, sweet and addictive.  The avocado was at its peak of ripeness, the eel sweet and almost melting, and the sauce, which Moon told me was cooked down from sea eel, lent a sweet and an umami flavor to this wonderful roll.\n\nBaked crab hand roll - My favorite dish of the day.  Beautiful crab (it tasted like Alaskan king, but not sure), baked with garlic butter and wrapped in soy paper.  If you love crab, you MUST order this.  I need to have it again.  So good.\n\nService was great, I  enjoyed speaking with Moon about all kinds of food topics, and the sushi bar is a pleasant place to while away a midday hour.

Of course they are some fried food on the menu that many can not mess up so this is a viable option.

We were seated at a cozy booth with a view of the sushi bar, which is perfect if you want an intimate dining experience but you want to observe the excitement of the sushi bar in action.  \n\nOur waiter greeted us right away and he was outstanding throughout the whole evening!  Unfortunately I did not catch his name.  He told us about the Arizona Restaurant week menu and the alcohol and the 'real' menu...I had major conflicts of interest!  We ended up opting for a feast of a little bit of everything Hahah! We ordered two options on the AZ restaurant week menu because the variety of the options was impressive!  Seemed like a great way to try a bit of everything since we had never eaten there!  And I had to try one of the Signature rolls; when I go to Sushi places I like to try their 'specialty' or something weird and unique!  As for the drinks I ordered white wine (Citra Pinot Grigio, Italy) to go with the mounds of fish coming our way and my date opted for kirin Ichiban beer, and the AZ restaurant week menu surprised us with a complimentary Roku Fusion Cocktail!\n\nThe Breakdown: \n\nThe signature roll we chose was the Tako Roll: Spicy Octopus; it was my FAVORITE thing of the night!  I find sometimes at sushi restaurants when they say spicy it is just more like a bit of a zing that you have to spice up with Wasabi, but Sushi Roku wasn't lying!  It came with spicy tuna dressing the top of the octopus roll and an interesting spicy reddish sauce drizzled across the top...Delicious!!! Great way to start the evening! \n\n1st course:  I chose 'Appetizers From the Sea' because I love fish, which came with Tuna Tataki, Salmon Sashimi and Tai Usuzukuri.  And my date chose 'Appetizers from the Farm' which entailed Kobe beef skewers, Fillet Mignon wrapped Asparagus, and Crispy Ji-Dori Chicken.  My favorites from each (yes we shared) were the Salmon Tataki, which had an amazing sauce (Truffle Tamari Soy) and the Kobe Beef Skewer (black pepper sauce)...my date liked the Tuna Tataki (close 2nd for me) and the asparagus wrapped with fillet Mignon (amazing).  We both decided we would forever pass on the Tai Usuzukuri (very blah) and the Crispy Ji-Dori chicken (over fried and just blah compared to the others).  \n\n2nd course: I opted for the 5 pieces of Roku Signature Style Sushi (Tai, Yellowtail, Salmon, Albacore, Tuna), accompanied with 3 pieces of Spicy Salmon Cut Roll and 3 pieces of California Cut Roll.  It was all quite amazing and a great assortment!  I loved the albacore sashimi!  But it was all good because I love tuna in general!  My date ordered the Grilled sirloin steak \"Japonaise\" with Japanese style potatoes; it was a pleasant surprise because we both didn't know what to expect.  It was a big tender steak with a unique gingery sauce and the potatoes and green beans that accompanied it were also Delicious.  Both plates left the table empty!  \n\nAnd yes still going: 3rd course:  DESSERT! The waiter brought out both the Mini Chocolate Volcano and a Fresh Fruit Sorbet!  They were both tasty but we could unfortunately barely eat them because we were so full!  The Sorbet tasted very fresh and fruity with beautiful fresh strawberries.  I love chocolate, so the Chocolate Volcano was decadently rich and wonderful, in which I dipped the fresh Strawberries from the other dessert; YUM! \n\nOh and when the surprise Roku Fusion drink showed up we were amazed at such a great Restaurant Week deal for $30!  BTW they did not skimp on the alcohol ;)  If you ever want to try Sushi Roku, Arizona Restaurant Week is a great time to go because you get a great variety from the menu!  It was a wonderful experience for us when we were just expecting to try a few different rolls and drinks!!

The pieces that were prepared well were actually delicious, with just the right amount of salt. But WTH, why was half of it wonky? \n\nThe yellowtail sashimi was completely overpowered by the sauce it was covered in. Don't get me wrong, the flavors were good, just completely imbalanced. Way too much sauce, and somehow, something with diced chiles didn't even have a hint of spice to it. The yellowtail was sliced so thin that it was unrecognizable even as fish, and the sauce effectively cooked it. This is a dish I particularly love, that my favorite sushi restaurant at home serves perfectly, so I was very disappointed.\n\nThese two dishes behind me, I move on to my tuna jalapeno roll. Based on its name, I'm expecting a very clean, crisp roll. When I open the box, I am accosted with huge dollops of spicy mayo on top of each piece. I dab it off so that the roll looks vaguely appetizing, if a bit smeared. I've never tasted a roll so bland in all my life. Apparently that's why it was swimming in mayo - to give it some flavor. Also, it was supposed to come with toro, but they were out of toro and subbed regular tuna, but charged me the same. Toro is a lot more expensive than regular tuna, so I wasn't thrilled about that, but I was expensing dinner, so the cost was really didn't matter. \n\nThat said, if I was actually spending my own money, I definitely would not spend it here.

Not too shabby.\n\nThe high quality I had expected out of a Scottsdale joint; the high value I did not. The only reason this place did not receive 5 stars was that it had a bit of a strong smell. Not fishy, more reminiscent of fried food. Perhaps a tempura order went out of control; things happen. It was not unbearable... yet I could smell it on my clothes later that evening. Then again, I am sometimes overly sensitized to smells.

But, all I got is nothing, because that's what I got before I left the most craptastic table known to mankind.\n\nI never heard of this place before until a friend suggested that I go because they were having their 5 year anniversary special. If I liked it, my job was to report back to my entire sorority so they could try it out on another day and we would be a group of happy fatties. If I didn't, at least I didn't pay full price. My sister and I were pumped to go as it would be a new experience in Old Town. My phone was charged; I was gonna take an ungodly amount of photos of my food. I called to make reservations and they told me that they had limited tables and I would be at a high-top table. I'm not usually one for such seating but I understood that they would be packed so I took it with joy and excitement.\n\nI got there early and checked-in with the hostess who said that my table was ready and all they had to do was clean it. You know the feeling when they lead you to a table next to the kitchen entrance, the bathroom, or some reckless child throwing spaghetti who needs to be tied up Silence of the Lambs style? Well, let me challenge that.\n\nThey had moved a high-top table from the bar area into the lit walkway where everyone walked in and out, but pushed it toward the wall where there was absolutely no light. I thought Cornish Pasty was dark, but where it was placed, I needed to turn my phone on just to talk to my sister across the little 2 ft. wide table. You could tell that a table wasn't supposed to be put there because well ... it was a walkway. If a party of more than 4 was coming through, one of us would definitely be bumped into. It only had 2 chairs, 2 settings but I reserved for 3. They said they knew and would set it up, even though I looked and the table was already clean and set? We waited for about 20 minutes and finally hunger overtook my sister who got up and asked if we could sit down. They told the same excuse to us they told everyone else 'We're waiting for some tables to move.\" My hopes for a better table soared like an American Eagle, but not another second longer did they shut down my dreams like the government. They pointed to the same table, and we awkwardly sat down ... while my boyfriend stood up waiting for the chair they still hadn't placed. There were at least 4 employees standing at the hostess podium, 2 feet away, just walking around my boyfriend like he had suddenly turned into stone. \n\nThe chair came 5 minutes later, but only because of my boyfriend's invisible yet oh so intense laser beam eyes gored into the back of their heads. No menus were given to us the entire time we sat. Once again, we are sitting so close to the hostess podium, I could play patty-cake with them. Then we waited until our server came, who immediately told us that we couldn't sit there if we were just waiting for a table, and that we would have to excuse ourselves to the bar area. \n\nThat was pretty much the last straw. Not even cheap Chili's would give this kind of rude service. My sister told her that we were her table but we were leaving. I walked the 2 steps over to the 4 hosts who looked baffled as to why we was leaving, but even a 3 year old watching Dora could have figured it out quicker than them.\n\nWe left and walked over to HiFi disgruntled, but even there we got better service even with the unwanted boobies all up in our faces. \n\nBasically, I am appalled at what happened. I understand that you're packed with such an awesome special going on but lord did they over-estimate the crowd, taking reservations when they shouldn't have, giving tables to customers that not even a cave troll would deserve, and the lack of communication between the front of the house and the dining floor. People go out of their way to try new places and if you can't be organized without being blinded by profit, why should we as customers waste gas just to be shafted. We left so frustrated and sad, not even getting the slightest chance to try anything that we had drooled over previously through Yelp photos.

However if I was to judge this place based on their normal prices, I'm not sure I would've considered this place worth the money.\n\nThe place is set on the bottom floor of W Hotel in Scottsdale and it meshes very well with the reputation and the vibe of the hotel.  Hip, sheik, trendy, while at times bordering on over the top.  The hostesses are screaming at the sushi bar everytime they walk their guests to their tables (sounded like they were yelling fishaaaay or something).  Got really annoying after awhile.  But I digress.\n\nFor the appetizer we got the crispy rice asparagus.  Basically an asparagus skewer covered in a fried batter of rice and peanuts.  The saltiness took me by surprise.  Not bad, but not what I anticipated.  For the main dish, we got the twelve piece assortment to share.  In reality it was more of a 20 piece dish as they served a mixture of california rolls, crab tempura, and a mix of different sashimis.  Basically reads like a greatest hits menu.  The albacore and octopus weren't really my thing, but the crab, tuna, and salmon were all pretty good.  It was more than enough sushi for two.  We washed it down with some saki of course.  For dessert we had a chocolate lava cake.  They got this one right, as the chocolate was moist on the outside and liquid hot on in the inside.\n\nAll totaled, one appetizer plus the sushi assortment, saki for two, dessert for two, with the 50% discount and tip was $55.  Great deal with the discount.  Normal prices are somewhat in line with some of the popular sushi venues I've been to (though you pay a little more for the venue I'd imagine).  Personally I like going to the small local mom and pop Japanese establishments like Hana, Tokyo Lobby, and Cherryblossom.  The prices are right, the quality is just as good (if not better), and its feels like a more authentic experience.  But thats just me.

YUM this was probably our favorite out of everything. The we got a couple of rolls  - soft shell crab and a crispy spicy tuna. The soft shell crab was huge and delicious. Great fresh flavor. The spicy tuna though is part of the reason for a star deduction. I was under the impression it would be, well... spicy and, well... crunchy. It was neither. The flavor of the fish was good and the sushi itself but the batter wasn't cooked until it was crispy so it took a lot of the flavor away instead of enhancing it. \n\nWe finished the night off with tempura popcorn shrimp which was very close behind the sashimi. These things are so delicious and popable and its a huge portion that could have easily been shared between 4 people instead of two. It comes with shaved asparagus and mushrooms and the sauce is just creamy and delicious.\n\nOur server Kristen was amazing. She was just so cute and patient with the two tables next to us (one was really annoying and demanding and outright rude and the other just needed a lot of attention). \n\nThe other reason for my star deduction is that when a new guest comes in and is seated, the hostess yells out something that sounds like \"airhsay\" (totally butchered that but I dont know how to spell it) and the sushi chefs and staff yell it back. After hearing it about 50 times during our meal and having it interrupt our conversation, you just get mad about it.

The Katana Roll, Baked Lobster Roll and the Spicy Tuna Jalapeno rolls are a few of our favorites.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 1}}], "state": "AZ", "stars": 3.5, "latitude": 33.5022311}, {"full_address": "Optima Camelview Complex\n7147 E Highland Ave\nScottsdale, AZ 85251", "rest_id": "ItMihRR-t810HgctGofF3g", "categories": ["Gluten-Free", "Vegan", "American (New)"], "city": "Scottsdale", "review_count": 0, "name": "Nourish", "longitude": -111.926436424255, "reviews": [], "state": "AZ", "stars": 3.5, "latitude": 33.5061904385714}], "85250": [{"full_address": "6137 N Scottsdale Rd\nSte 108\nScottsdale, AZ 85250", "rest_id": "FCnN5HnV63OPnxl9ga-YKg", "categories": ["Gastropubs", "Gluten-Free", "American (New)"], "city": "Scottsdale", "review_count": 0, "name": "TapHouse Kitchen", "longitude": -111.9248055, "reviews": [], "state": "AZ", "stars": 3.5, "latitude": 33.5268094}], "85257": [{"full_address": "7607 E McDowell Rd\nSte 108\nScottsdale, AZ 85257", "rest_id": "hfdiI70VeWZPfe-DTQancg", "categories": ["Bakeries", "Food", "Gluten-Free", "Donuts"], "city": "Scottsdale", "review_count": 0, "name": "Gluten Free Creations", "longitude": -111.917283385992, "reviews": [], "state": "AZ", "stars": 4.5, "latitude": 33.465298753927}], "85007": [{"full_address": "701 W McDowell Rd\nSuite 101\nPhoenix, AZ 85007", "rest_id": "7pxa5tueoEcmt6hztqsz2A", "categories": ["Asian Fusion", "Gluten-Free", "Chinese"], "city": "Phoenix", "review_count": 0, "name": "Pei Wei Asian Diner", "longitude": -112.0829359, "reviews": [], "state": "AZ", "stars": 3.0, "latitude": 33.4654801}], "85255": [{"full_address": "20851 N Scottsdale Rd.\nSuite 105\nScottsdale, AZ 85255", "rest_id": "VGYaXB8kJjqBBIg6bsx1Sg", "categories": ["Asian Fusion", "Gluten-Free", "Chinese"], "city": "Scottsdale", "review_count": 0, "name": "Pei Wei Asian Diner", "longitude": -111.9253248, "reviews": [], "state": "AZ", "stars": 3.5, "latitude": 33.6740673}], "85254": [{"full_address": "Kierland Commons\n7132 E Greenway Pkwy\nScottsdale, AZ 85254", "rest_id": "UtUXhKh7vOVvWJF48IzJvQ", "categories": ["Asian Fusion", "Gluten-Free", "Chinese"], "city": "Scottsdale", "review_count": 0, "name": "P F Chang's China Bistro", "longitude": -111.926204898515, "reviews": [], "state": "AZ", "stars": 3.0, "latitude": 33.6234604140552}, {"full_address": "10392 N Scottsdale Rd\nScottsdale, AZ 85254", "rest_id": "9Ep4sguv3HH_8lWyzSogjw", "categories": ["Burgers", "Gluten-Free", "American (New)"], "city": "Scottsdale", "review_count": 0, "name": "Indulge Burgers & More", "longitude": -111.9268582, "reviews": [], "state": "AZ", "stars": 4.0, "latitude": 33.5808348}, {"full_address": "4807 E Greenway Rd\nScottsdale, AZ 85254", "rest_id": "7vz3HGtHzvz1JjiphH9uOQ", "categories": ["Mexican", "Gluten-Free", "Latin American"], "city": "Scottsdale", "review_count": 0, "name": "The Corn Flower", "longitude": -111.9770503, "reviews": [], "state": "AZ", "stars": 4.0, "latitude": 33.625289}]}}
