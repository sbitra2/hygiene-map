He had been running a fever all night and would not stop crying. We got there and the tech at the front desk was checking in another child, but still took his time to look at me and ask me to fill in the sign-in sheet. He didn't take longer than 5 minutes on the other patient, took them back to a room and then came back out and it was our turn.\nHe was very calm and tried to make my son laugh, even though he wasn't having any of it, but was very professional at the same time. He ran through his part of checking my son in. This hospital even provided diapers and wipes for the kids. I have never had a hospital do that for my son's. \nHe took us back to our room and immediately a nurse came in. I wish I could have remembered all of these wonderful people's names, but it was so early in the morning and not having slept that night, my brain was not really working. \nAll the nurses that came in to do what they needed to do in order to figure out what was wrong with my baby, were so kind, funny, caring, and gentle with him. The only time he cried was when they put a catheter in him, but i am sure it was because it was painful & not because of the nurses. \nI recommend anyone with children take them here. I was extremely satisfied with everything they did, said, and offered.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Unfortunately, I've had to take my son here a couple of times.
