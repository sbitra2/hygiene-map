She told me it had four stars and a lot of reviews, I was sold.\n\nHere's the rundown. \nTom Yum Shrimp - it was a super cold day again, so a hot soup was the perfect remedy for that. Love this soup. I was  craving the sourness from the lemongrass flavored soup. The mushrooms & shrimp were very good. But what set this Tom Yum from the others I've had was the cherry tomato. Never had that in this soup before and it worked so well. The pop in your mouth was a flavor explosion, delicious. \n\nSatay Chicken - it was just okay. It was lacking in flavor IMO. Even with the satay sauce. The cucumber salad it came with was outstanding. \n\nLemon Chicken - I never had lemon chicken at a Thai place before. Usually I find this dish at a Chinese restaurant. But I have to say, I am a fan of this dish. The lemon flavor really stands up to the deep fried battered chicken the sauce was in. \n\nPanang Pork - I usually get Panang beef. Having pork even though it was very good. I still prefer the beef. The panang curry was outstanding. \n\nPineapple Fried Rice - it was good. Chunks of pineapple and cashew nut pieces all over the dish. As for the flavor, it was just ok for me. \n\nPad See Ew - my wife's favorite Thai noodle dish.

On the butcher's recommendation, I went for the select ribeye for (I think) ~$15/pound. It was excellent! My husband and I both loved the flavor, and I find that price reasonable for a good steak.\nIn addition, the seabass I got was really good, too, although definitely higher priced at $25/lb. \nMy only complaint would be that their steaks are all grass-fed, but grain-finished.

Choices - They had some great looking meats like Filet, Ribeye, Hamburgers and sausages.  \n\nc.  My choice - I was looking for grass fed beef and they did not have any.  They mentioned that their beef was grass fed and then finished with grain.  I ordered a beef brisket and got 8 lbs for about 35.00.  They sealed the meat in vacuum packing as I asked to cut this in half. That was great service.\n\nd.  The problem was:  The fat.  When you are cooking brisket, you cut out the extra fat. I was trimming so much off, that I kept it and weighed it all.  Nearly 3 lbs of fat  My 8 lb purchase was 5 lb and at 35.00 that is 7.00 per lb.  This was incredibly expensive in my book.  After cooking this, so much fat rose to the top of the juices.  I did not expect this much fat in a high quality place.\n\ne.  I think it was - my choice. All the meat in their display looks great and lean. The brisket they took out from their walk in refrigerator and it was packaged.\n\nI have check both Sprouts and Whole Foods and they sell both grass fed and Non GMO- no Hormone beef.

Also, the strands of beads that are supposed to cover the waitress stand make you feel like there could be pot sales going on right back there. \n\nWe asked for a table as far away from the terrible Sinatra impersonator as possible at which time the hostess commented that we might actually be able to have a conversation if we stayed far away but unfortunately you can't get far enough away from him unless you drive out of the parking lot.  Additionally, the synthesized keyboard and scratchy microphone even furthered the feeling of being at a bad family event.\n\nWe ordered cocktails quickly but it took about 30 minutes from them to arrive (extremely watered down) to the table.  I then ordered the Greek spaghetti which I think only a horse would like given it tasted like a huge salt stick.  My wife ordered the chicken pita with no onions - it took again about 30 minutes for the food to arrive and my wife was horrified to find raw chicken in a pita with just lettuce and the \"side Greek\" salad was lettuce drenched in dressing even though the menu said the Greek salad had the normal items such as tomatoes, feta and cucumbers.  We tried to send the sandwich back when it then took another 20 minutes to get a new sandwich which honestly looked like an entirely different menu item - chicken in a pita with raw tomatoes and onions with a Greek salad that actually had vegetables on it however it also had a TON of onions we decided we had enough and asked for the check and left.\n\nWith so many great restaurants in Scottsdale and Phoenix we are amazed that such a bad one would even try to open.  It felt like the owner of the restaurant was trying so hard to make it seem like the restaurant was \"classy\" but in the end it came across as extremely cheap and of course the raw chicken didn't really help.

Olympus, and pay a visit to us mortals. Fortunately they landed in Phoenix, and they came bearing gifts. These can be sampled at Athena Greek Cuisine, a new restaurant in the shopping center at Mayo and Scottsdale Rd.\n\n     If the Scordalia ($6) isn't heaven sent, I don't know what is. This spread, made from bread, almonds, potato, olive oil, white wine vinegar and GARLIC is jaw-droppingly good. It has a mellow, almost sweet taste and is good smeared on anything, but especially on the Greek Sausage appetizer ($7), another gift. In fact, all the appetizers we had were delicious. Ken chose Grilled Octopus ($12); Pat had Greek Style Wings ($9), which had been marinated in olive oil, parsley, oregano and lemon (these were even better cold the next day). Marinated Beets ($7) were refreshing. Meg, to whom we owe a debt of gratitude for introducing us to Athena, says the Fried Smelts ($7) are tasty too. It's so nice to have out-of-the-ordinary menu selections available. And the servings are surprisingly large, great for sharing.\n\n     The entrees don't reach the sublime level of the appetizers, but for the most part they were good and reasonably priced. Meg and I split Moussaka ($13). It was as good as any I've had in Phoenix, but there was nothing to lift it out of the ordinary. Stewed green beans were served with all the entrees, and these were a nice foil for the richness of the moussaka. Ken had the Combination Plate ($15) which had Pastitsio, Moussaka, Dolmades with Avgolemono Sauce, and Roasted Leg of Lamb. I thought the lamb was \novercooked (but that seems to be the norm for Greek restaurants) and tasted curiously liver-y. Pat was disappointed with her Greek Spaghetti ($12) which was way too salty.\n\n     We were quite full, but Pat, being half Greek, felt we had to sample the Galaktoboureko, a filo and custard concoction. The custard was pasty, rather than\nsilky, and the lemon sauce needed some zest to wake it up. But it was nice to see something besides Baklava on the menu (in fact there were a number of Greek desserts). \n\n     I loved Athena's decor. It's happily over the top. There's a statue of Athena centered in the doorway, an aqua back-lit frieze on one wall, a white bar framed with Greek columns. The white painted wooden chairs (which Ken said were not very comfortable) look great against the dark floor. The only jarring note is the two TV screens flanking the bar. If you go on Athena's website you can get a virtual tour of the restaurant, and also check out the menu. \n\n     Our waiter Chris and his \"shadow\" were both very pleasant and seemed familiar with the menu. There was a huge amount of staff for the number of patrons, but better too many than too few. Given that Athena has been open only for a short time, I find it easy to overlook the shortcomings - in fact we're planning to return this weekend.

The spanikopita is huge (too huge) and the potatoes are greasy and the veggies are drenched in butter (tastes good, but I'm not used to all that fat).  So, the meal was mediocre. We paid $100 for 4 people to eat lunch (including several appetizers, but no alcohol).  I thought it was a bit steep for a Sunday lunch.  I'm sure the other people that had dinner there with all the hoopla of the belly dancing, etc. got their money's worth, but we were a little underwhelmed.

If the owner wasn't so friendly upon our arrival, I would have probably given this place a lower rating.

Plenty of food we can never eat it all and need a box. Teppanyaki is a fav for b-day's they sing and beat the drum while they bring you a tasty fruit boat. They also take your pic and you can put it up on their wall or take it with you\n\nThe staff is very friendly there. There is a huge pond fountain thing complete with koi and tiny trurtle in the center that seperates the teppanyaki tables from the dinner tables and sushi bar so you have your 3 choices. I have a 5 yr old and she love's the water feature, they even let her feed the koi at times.

Let's hope the TV hangs in there...I have dined and lunched there half a dozen times over the past few months, and have yet to be disappointed with anything off of their menu. It's ALL been good, from the garlic naan to the lamb tandoori. Vegetarian fare is listed on the menu, though I've never tried it. Chai (milky tea) is available from the counter, comp'd.\n\nInterestingly, unlike any other East Indian restaurant I have patronized, the management of the TV do not offer a lunch buffet. I heard one of the owners comment that to do so would 'dumb down' the quality of his food. Given the results from his a la carte menu, I'm not about to argue with the man.\n\nThe ambience isn't much....about what you'd expect of a Denny's, really.

She - get this - gave me a scared expression and said in her halting English \"I.. not know! don't eat it!!\" then scurried off. Don't eat it?!

The service, decor and ambiance don't really matter to me so much as a good meal does.\n\nThis place is nothing to look at. I think it was a fried chicken shack before Tandoori Village took over it- and it still looks like it. The waiters are teenagers du jour and are acceptable, but you might have to flag one down to get your chai or water refilled. But like I said, that hardly matters when my 5-star review is all about the food.\n\nTo start, order hot chai. It will come unsweetened and very hot- but stir and stir with sugar while you wait for your meal. You'll find yourself strangely addicted to a second cup, even if you don't like whole milk (I detest it and this is the only time I drink it.)\n\nThe naan basket is fantastic- a variety of flavored naans, onion, garlic, potato. Also fantastic is the papadum- it's like a flat crispy cracker flavored with Indian spices. Try it with the two chutneys- the green one is mint and hot, the other is sweeter and earthier. Also try mixing them!\n\nI love the palak paneer- a spinach dish made with Indian cheese- and the basmati rice. The vindaloo is also amazing. Their curries and \"sauce dishes\" will share a little easier than their tandoori or grilled dishes- get a variety of sauces and meats and trade around the table for a little sample of everything. I always leave a little high on spice and very satisfied. \n\nIt's nothing special to look at, but it really depends on what you go in wanting. If you want a \"slice of India\" complete with belly-dancers and ornate carpets, you might want to try somewhere else.

I know. You are having thoughts of how disgusting a food hot pockets are. They are. However, a pasty is so much more. First and foremost it is super filling. I really could have just eaten half and taken the rest home for lunch the next day, but I literally COULD NOT STOP EATING IT! I tried to stop. Then my craving got worse. I started taking parts of pasties from the other guests at my table. Second, it is filled with quality ingredients. Whether it be peppered steak bits of chicken and artichokes, these fillings are amazingly put together and perfectly seasoned. Third, NO MICROWAVES! They are baked goodness that comes from the heavens. \n\nWhat did I have to make me crumble at the knees like this? Well my little heart broke opening night since I wanted to try the Oggie (the traditional pasty) which includes steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga (swede) With a side of red wine gravy or ketchup. We did come pretty late so I had to make a decision fast. I opted for the Pesto Chicken. Marinated chicken breast, mushrooms, artichokes, fresh mozzarella and pesto with a side of marinara came to the table. All of this wrapped up neatly in a flaky outer crust. I don't even know how to begin because it was all a blur after that. I devoured this thing. There was very little talking at our table as we were all busy consuming our pasties as well as protecting them from each other. \n\nFor dessert we all (four of us) shared a Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding. It was plenty enough after our dinner. It is a square of homemade bread baked in chocolate brandy sauce.

Think of it as a local pub with lots of good food.\n\nSpeaking of food, we ate a ton of it.  I started off with the Cream of Leek, Potato, and Stilton soup (fyi: this is vegetarian/no chicken stock).  The cup is a good portion, and served with two large pieces of homemade bread and homemade butter.  It's a steal for $3.50.  Although I really enjoyed it, the Stilton cheese it might make the soup a little salty for some people.  As for the pasties, I wanted something more traditional and ordered the Cheese and Onion.  It tasted great and everything was cooked well, but I couldn't bring myself to use the ketchup or marina that came with it.  My husband had the Veggie Chicken Tikka Masala and his was really good as well.  There was a nice blend of spices and it came with a side of mint-yogurt dressing that we both enjoyed.  \n\nCornish Pasty also offers a decent beer selection and a 14-oz will set you back $6. \n\nI loved the atmosphere here and all the employees were laid-back and friendly.  Cornish Pasty would even make a good spot just to grab a few drinks for an evening.  I can't speak for the authenticity of the food (which is questionable considering they offer a Mexican pasty), but I do know that I enjoyed what I ordered. The pasties are large and filling so make sure to bring your appetite!\n\nNote to Vegetarians: They use Quorn in about half of their veggie pasties.  While being a popular meat-alternative in the UK, this was the first time my husband and I have ever had it.  I found it to be pretty much the same as most other faux-meats.  I'm sure they could leave it out of the pasties if you asked them.\n\nNote to Vegans: According to their menu, they offer at least two vegan pasties daily.  \n\nNote to Omnivores: If my vegetarian pasties tasted awesome, you have nothing to worry about.

Flavorful and filling. Loved the red wine gravy that accompanied my pasty. I'm not usually a gravy/sauce type person; however, the red wine gravy was a great accent to my meaty/potato-y goodness...and it still worked as a hand held food. (I just drizzled my gravy over the bite I was about to take.)\n\nYou have to try the mushroom, walnut, spinach soup. Absolutely awesome. I know, as adventuresome as I am, the walnuts threw me for a loop. I shouldn't have worried at all. The walnuts gave a nice crunch to my mushroom soup without detracting from the mushroom flavor. I know the spinach was there because of the color but again, no distortion of taste to the mushroom. The soups are touted as being made from scratch, I believe them. Yummy, hot, and partnered with two slices of chewy soft bread. Oh, so good. \n\nI can't wait to make a return trip. So many pastys to try, not to mention some very interesting desserts.

The seats are the unusual thing. its like.. formed to your butt. well at least mine anyway... apparently it was uncomfortable for my friends (small) XD\n\nSince we weren't really hungry, and the waiter said each of these pasties were dense and weighed like a pound each, we opted to get 1, and share. Then dessert afterwards (as per recommendation on yelp xD) Since this was our first time, we ordered \"The Oggie\" which was their traditional pasty, which had steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga (type of turnip), with a side of red wine gravy. \n\nWhen the pasty came, it was already split in half, on two plates (+1!). I tried picking up my half.. indeed it is heavy and pretty dense. but the pastry crust looks sooooo good !  the inside was filled with the ingredients i had listed before... there was a LOT of potatoes, and not that much steak in my half. The red wine gravy was nice, a little sour like you'd expect from a sauce reduction made with red wine. The crust was super good and flaky. not too buttery. For me, i would have preferred the filling to be a little more seasoned. Seemed a little plain for me, even drenching it in the red wine gravy. \n\nAs for dessert, we had got the Banoffee subbing the bananas for strawberries (my friend doesnt like bananas). Its a very simple dessert, made with a sugarless heavy whipped cream, cut fruit, a crushed graham cracker crust on the bottom, and a homemade caramel. Not being a fan of caramel, but this was actually surprisingly good. Since its a different type of caramel, it wasnt sticky, like sticky to the teeth or roof of your mouth. Took my head quite a while to wrap around the concept... simplicity and different, but good. My friend thoroughly enjoyed it, after slightly struggling to finish her half of the pasty. For those who want to try something different, i recommend trying this. quite inexpensive too. $5? good to share with. \n\nOverall, not bad. I'd like to come back and try their other pasties.

It has a nice combo of 2 top tables and large booths, plus about 16 seats at the bar.  I had the meat and cheese, which is pork/sage sausage with swiss and cheddar cheeses.  At $9.00, this is a great value considering the ingredients and size of the meal.  The crust was buttery and flaky and browned perfectly.  They clearly have the cooking of these things down.  The pasty was full, no bite was without meat and cheese.  The cheese was melty and the sausage was juicy.  It was a winner without sauces, but they offer you sauces!  I couldn't decide, so my server gave me both the cream mustard and the red wine gravy.  I liked both, but the mustard was the winner.  It was like a milder Dijon, and added so much to the sandwich.  I think the gravy needed to reduce a bit more to make it thicker and cook out a little more of the red wine flavor.\n\nI got the side of garlic mashed potatoes with cheddar cheese.  I thought this was a normal sized side dish, and I was mistaken.  It was easily enough for 2, probably 3.  I liked the potatoes, they were as advertised:  garlic, potatoes, and cheese.  Simple and quality.  \n\nI got the wife the rosemary steak and oven fries to go.  Fortunately, when she ate, I got bites of both dishes.  The rosemary steak was again packed full of ingredients.  I may be mistaken, but I think it was even larger than the one I ate, which was huge.  The rosemary and potatoes make the pasty fantastic, it's basically a meal in and of itself.  The oven fries were long and crisp, simply seasoned with salt and pepper.  This is another large side dish, easily shareable.

Their address says they are off of East Sahara, but I ended up turning on to Commercial Center Drive on my right going east coming from Las Vegas Blvd. If you hit Maryland Parkway, you have gone too far. They are in the same plaza as The Green Door, Lotus of Siam, and Komol, which is right next to them.\n\nNow that you have found the place, you still kind of have to do a double take when you get to the entrance for there are no indications on the doors themselves. All you can go by is their Cornish Pasty sign at the top of the building.\n\nNow, what is a pasty you ask? According to Wickipedia:\nA pasty (/p\u00e6sti/, Cornish: Hogen; Pasti), (sometimes known in the United States as a pastie or British pasty)[1] is a baked pastry, a traditional variety of which is particularly associated with Cornwall, the westernmost county in England. It is made by placing uncooked filling typically of meat and vegetables, without meat in vegetarian versions, on a flat pastry circle and folding it to wrap the filling, crimping the edge to form a seal. After baking, the result is a raised semicircular food item.\n\nSo now that you know what the technical term is, let me tell you my version, or should I say my good Yelp buddy Chris \"Downtown Chris\" R's version is. Basically, its a gourmet hot pocket, but a hundred times better. Mainly because when you order it, it is made from scratch. When you take that first bite, it's obvious that it did not come from a freezer straight into the microwave. Some people compare it to an empanada. Some think its similar to a chicken pot pie. Whatever you hear, let your own taste buds tell you the truth.\n\nWhen you first enter the establishment, just the magnificent odor herbs and garlic emanating from the kitchen will tell you that they are whipping up something extraordinary in the kitchen. You have a bar in the middle and you have some pretty good sized tables and benches to comfortably seat your party. The lighting is bit low which could be a good thing for you lovebirds on a first time date or otherwise.\n\nAs you check out the menu, you will find that just about every option is mouthwatering. With me, I finally went with the Mexican (8.50). It is Mexican-spiced and simmered steak strips, potatoes, eggs, jalapenos and cheddar. Comes with a side of sour cream and salsa. I also opted for a side of Garlic Mashed Potatoes with Cheese (3.50).\n\nSince me and the wifey were sharing, we were thinking this was enough food. We were wrong. It was more than enough. The Mexican Pasty we ordered was basically a giant hot pocket cut in half. The Garlic Mashed Potatoes came in a medium sized casserole type of bowl with plenty of melted cheese on top of it. This could of been a meal in itself. Needless to say, we had plenty of it left because we were saving room for dessert because my wifey has a sweet tooth.\n\nAgain, looking at the dessert menu we were confounded with the delectable options we were gonna have to decide to get. So we ended up getting the Peanut Butter and Jelly Pasty (6.00). This concoction has peanut butter, bananas and raspberry jelly whipped cream and raspberry sauce. Comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The best way I can describe this item is that it's like a deep fried peanut butter jelly and banana sandwich topped off with raspberry sauce. Instead of milk you have it in the form of a scoop of vanilla ice cream to wash it down. This was a nice sized item as well and we could only eat half of it. I know my wife was happy for she had something good for lunch the next day.\n\nService was excellent. Our beverages were constantly filled, food came out in a timely manner, and she answered any and all questions we had with a smile.\n\nLastly, here are their hours.\nMon-Sat 11 am to 12 am\nSun 11 am to 10 pm\n\nI love the fact that they close at midnight Monday through Saturday because sometimes, you just happen to be hungry around 9 or 10 because you had an early dinner or was forced to eat your in laws cooking, etc. Whatever your reason is, these guys are here for you!\n\nSo in closing, I don't normally do a long review. But when I do, its usually a 5 star worthy place and then some! It's not always that you find a place that you can bring your family where you can get great food with generous portions at great prices and great service. I suggest you make your way here because I  guarantee that once this place gets that much more popular, the only complaint you might have would be that you had to wait because the place was packed!\n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #34", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 5, "useful": 15, "cool": 9}}, {"text": "We almost always try and seek out new spots to dine on the weekends.

It's more than I'd usually spend on a beverage ($6.50) but well worth it.\n\nOpted for the cream of leek soup  ($3 cup) and the Royale with cheese pasty ($9). Soup was smooth and creamy, flavor was pleasant and Stilton was pronounced. The bread and butter it's served with is delightful- thick, dense bread with plenty of smooth butter.  \n\nPasty seemed to take a while, but it was worth it- stuffed full of beef, mushrooms, onions, and cheese, it really hit the spot. Gourmet Hot Pocket indeed. Crust was buttered and delicious without being too thick or getting gummy, stuffings were hot and complemented one another. Menu mentions several dips it can be served with, I didn't mention one in my order but was brought a dark reddish sauce- based on taste, I could not tell if it was a light house-made ketchup or an odd barbecue sauce, but either way I did not use much of it. Might suggest the Thousand Island as more complementary.\n\nService was attentive, prompt,  and polite.

There is a purse hook underneath the bar which is a great feature.  Our server was very cool, did not catch her name.  I got iced green tea which was great.

While we waited for our meals to be prepared, we watched a chef in front of us at the bar prepare the lamb vindaloo pasties (what I almost ordered, and will definitely get next time).  I was intrigued because the night before, I had learned how to make dumplings.  Now in front of my eyes, a chef was making essentially a giant dumpling, using egg wash instead of water to seal the dough but crimping it similarly!  I felt my parallel universes collide.\n\nOur pasties came out piping hot and cut in half.  Eric R. learned something new about me that he didn't know (and that is hard for a married couple): that I really like gelled cranberry sauce and even enjoy the canned one.  I never think about it though so I never buy it or talk about it!  The pilgrim was very delicious.  Eric R. asked to swap halves so we ended up eating each other's first halves.  The chicken tikka masala was very moist and the curry sauce was spot on.  Eric R. thought it was a tad too spicy for him which means mild for me :)  Then we started on our second halves and ended up switching plates entirely.  He really liked the red wine gravy and I was quite happy with the CTM.\n\nThe vibe is cool and it was a hot spot just for people to drink while we were there.

Perfect pair. (another reason this place deserves a high-five is because every pasty comes with a side dipping sauce and everything, in my opinion, is better dipped in some sauce)\n\nMy boyfriend order The Chicken Greek, was was also pretty yummy (I definitely liked my better though). We also ordered the Oven Chips with added garlic -- the garlic is cooked with the chips giving it a nice burnt flavor (burnt in a good way)\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding which was next to orgasmic.

Conveniently enough, the pasties are cut in half, and they were willing to provide extra dipping sauce for free.\n\nI tried the bangers and mash ($9.00) first: sausage, grilled onions, and mashed potatoes with an interesting red wine gravy. Friend didn't care for the wine flavor, but I appreciated that it wasn't just plain gravy. Second up was the lamb vindaloo, which I ordered for the lamb-ness although I found the vindaloo was dominant. The Indian spices, unfortunately, are not in my wheelhouse, the spicyness was definitely a challenge for my delicate / capsaicin-sensitive tongue, and the yogurt sauce was just odd and didn't quite complement the lamb vindaloo. I'll take the blame for most of this, but I'm going to hold the yogurt sauce against CPC.\n\nI've gotta say, though, that the pasty shell around each of the fillings was quite good. Very flaky and golden brown, yet not burnt at all, and just the right thickness so as not to distract from the filling.

My selling point was, it had his four favorite food groups: cheese, potatoes, ground meat, and beer. \n\nWell Yelp, we found a winner! We finally found a place that we both liked! \n\nI loved the Mushroom, Walnut and Spinach soup. It's served with a side of bread and delicious, easily spreadable butter. \n\nThe Tomcat LOVED the Oggie, a pasty filled with steak, onion, potatoes and rutabaga. I thought it was ok, it tastes bland. It tastes a lot like the food Tomcat cooks at home (his ancestry is Irish/Scottish). So, to some people, bland is good. They even have MUSHY peas (that's how it's described on their menu, \"mushy\" peas), so this is some authentic British food. Who else eats mushy peas? And are proud of it? \n\nLuckily, I didn't order a pasty, but if I did, I'd go with a more flavorful one, like the Chicken Tikka Masala, or the Lamb Vindaloo. Instead, I went with the Broccoli and Cauliflower Cheese Bake. The dish is exactly as it sounds. The cheese baked on top is awesome. There's also cheese melted inside with the fresh broccoli and cauliflower. It's like a healthier, non-carb version of mac-n-cheese. Tomcat and I both agreed, this dish was delicious. \n\nI also got a bottle of their much talked about banana-beer bread. Ugh. Bitter. Pass. You can smell the banana and taste a little bit in the aftertaste, but most of the time, it tasted like a strong, bitter beer.\n\nThe highlight of the meal was the Shirley Temple's Pudding, a sticky toffee pudding made with Treacle and served with ice cream.

It was a pretty dead night for a friday considering that there was First Friday going on. \n\nLove the intimate low-lighting. The design for this bar is cool. Picture polished wood and beer. Clean place. One side of the place has two-seater tables with the same unique park-bench swivel chairs. The other side has two long tables with long benches for bigger parties.

Perfect bar food to soak up alcohol. Freshly cracked pepper and sea salt seasoned this dish so well. These fries set them apart from other cardboard-tasting carbon copies. \n\nThe leek, potato, and stilton soup ($3.50 cup) was creamy, well-made, and not bland at all. For those who don't know, stilton is a type of rich cheese. I should have asked for the bowl ($5ish). The cheese flavor went beautifully with the leeks and potatoes giving it a hearty flavor. Came a couple slices of bread and butter.\n\nPASTY: My Bangers & Mash pasty was okay. Really drying on the inside including the hard puff pastry encasing it. It came with an excellent red wine gravy sauce so maybe I should have asked for more of that. Although it was okay to eat, it was really salty and dense. I expected maybe a sauce/liquid/melted something on the inside when I stab it with my fork. It would have made the dish more palatable and not just a literal meat-cake. \n\nTrue, I dipped it in my gravy, but it was still a little difficult to eat. Meat was a bit too tough.

The Pilgrim is taking the best Thanksgiving leftovers and rolling it up in a flakey crust and the best part is having ample gravy and cranberry sauce to go with it (they will offer more upon asking). The Chicken Tikka Masala would rival any good Indian restaurant and served with a nice mint yogurt. Tender chicken breast so full of flavor and it tastes good even after sitting in the fridge a few days and reheated.\nThese pasties are all handcrafted and made ahead of time then par-baked for 90 minutes. When you order, they are finished in the oven, then served neatly sliced in half with a perfect crust in every bite.\nBe sure to save room for the Shirley Temple pudding because it is life changing. It's served HOT in a mini caldron that is like 900 degrees which carmelized the sides of the pudding into a chewy crust, and you must get it with vanilla ice cream.

Each time I have gone it has been late afternoon, early evening. But having lived in Las Vegas for many years I remember being in that area at all hours of the day and night (Anyone remember Mary K arcade) and never had any issues\n\nThis was my second time to Cornish Pasty Co. Both time I came with family and kids. The youngest being 15 months old. Each time we were able to find a table with ease and the staff was very attentive and helpful with suggestions and tips. We had some questions about some of the beers on the menu and the server was able to give a good description and offered to get us a sample. Because of her knowledge and those samples we ordered beers with our meal as well. I think the most frustrating thing about the menu is that everything sounds so good.One thing that we figured out on our own is to have backup plans for everything you plan on ordering in case they are out. My son wanted an order of mushy peas and they were out and then again when we went to order dessert they were out of the Banoffee Pie. Other than that everyone was extremely happy with their orders. The over chips were on point, not too crispy that they were dried out, but not too mushy either. The garlic mashed potatoes were another hit off of the sides menu. I was a little disappointed with the broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake. I read in one review that is was like a vegan mac and cheese. Well to me mac and cheese is creamy and gooey. The order we got was more like an au gratin and not very creamy. Was still very good just not what i was expecting. Last really good thing is that the food is well seasoned. I didn't once have to ask someone to pass the salt or pepper. Kudos to the staff. \n\nA few other things to keep in mind there is no custom ordering of pasties. They are made in batches and cannot be customized. \n\nAll of the desserts are large enough to share between at least two people. The Banoffee pie and Chocolate Bread and Butter pudding are good examples of that. \n\nMy Favorite is the Stocky Toffee pudding, again you can share it but after 1 bite you won't want to. either way i don't see how you can go wrong here.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "I'm going to give this place a 3 on my first try and I'm more than willing to try it again.  \nThe restaurant is pub like setting.  Don't be afraid of the hood :)\n\nWhat is behind my 3 stars is that everything I ate was salty.  When we had arrived, we got lucky because it was not at the time busy.  There seemed to be only one person on the floor taking care of the bar and the orders.  I had to chase him down for a refill on my tea.  \n\nI started off with Mushroom walnut spinach soup.  Its the consistency of chunky baby food.  I think what I should have done was see if I could of taste tested the soups they had available before choosing this.  I attempted to finish the soup but really couldn't because of the saltiness.  Even dipping the bread didn't help.  \n\nI love garlic fries, so I went for the garlic oven chips.  Its almost like steak fries.  It wasn't smothered in garlic as I would have wanted to my liking, but again the over seasoning of salt overwhelmed the \"homemade\" taste.  \n\nFor my pasty I had the shepards pie.  I have a thing for shepards pie so that was why I chose that.  Now my description of a pasty is a combination of a Empenada/Porowski (If you know what those are), but on steroids.  You may think that the portions look small, but if you are not that hungry, I bet you will take your other half home.  I went for lamb in my pasty and as I took a bite, I thought that I should of went the latter.  The gravy has more of a wine taste than regular brown gravy.  So, I attempted to put Siracha on it, but they had the Lum Kee Siracha.  Must get the rooster one.  \n\nThat was my experience, from my point of view.  I'm not willing to give up on this place.

Havasu/Sorting Break/need I say more). I do not frequent places East of LVB north of Flamingo, Don't ask me why.  You will find the CPC nestled in the once prestigious Commercial Center just East of LVB on Sahara.  There isn't very much out there, so hard to miss.  Just don't go wondering into the notorious \"Vista\" area.\n\nThe ambiance exhibits a low light atmosphere expected of most British Style Pubs.  The dining area consists of a huge island bar that accompany seats all around.  The majority of the other seating was made up of large tables and benches, some of which were sketchy at best (weight tolerance wise).  Otherwise, even as dark as it was, the lighting was more than adequate and provided a shadow barrier between sections to separate parties.\n\nI started the day with a 20 oz. Boddington draft, while the wifey tried the iced tea, which she loved.  I was excited for the upcoming Pacquiao vs. Bradley rematch and needed to make sure I put some hefty cushion in the tummy for the alcohol waterboarding that was fiXing to take place.\n\nTherefore, I opted for the Pilgrim while the wifey ordered the Shepard's Pie pasty along with a side of chips and mushroom/walnut/spinach soup.  The soup came out first and was hot from the assembly line, the chips (fries) came soon after.  The soup was rich and flavorful with different contrasts, but boy was it salty.  The same went for the chips, for some reason they seemed like they were rubbed and marinated with sea salt because it seemed imbedded in each bite.  We had to douse them in ketchup as an equalizer, believe it or not.  The fake siracha didn't help either, unlike with piroskis and enpanadas...call me crazy.  Without the Bodd, I would have shriveled like a slug since I would have been cured by all that salt.  Beware!\n\nThe pasties on the other hand were a hit.  They come sliced in halves on what looks to be served on some sort of ball peen hammered pewter dish, although, it felt skimpier than metal, either way it was a nice touch aesthetically.  The Pilgrim reminded me of the Bobby from Capastrami and is complemented with cranberry sauce and wine gravy.  The Shepard's Pie contained the normal mash but filled with ground lamb instead of beef, wHich was delicious but could have used more peas.\n\nOverall, I would have to rate our experience on a high three, but not quite a solid four, due to the salty chips.

The Oggie's potatoes are cut au gratin style. Most if not all U.P. pasties' potatoes are diced.

To be frank, I think our eyes were bigger than our stomachs because we barely made a dent in the third pasty. It is nice that the pasty is served cut in half which made it nice for sharing. \n\nOur pies came in a rather timely manner - within 15 minutes of ordering which was a godsend. \n\nFirst let's talk about the crust. The pies have a short crust pastry which leads to a crisp, slightly crumbly texture. It is not a puff pastry or your standard flaky pie crust. It held up quite well considering the moisture from the filling. It had a beautiful golden color and had the perfect thickness to match.\n\nThat being said, to not overwhelm the crust, the filling tends to be a bit on the drier side. So you must consume the pastry with the accompanying dipping sauce. It not only provides contrasting flavours, it enhances the overall \"mouth-feel\".\n\nChicken tikka masala - a little on the spicier side, I found this pasty to really require the cool yogurt mint sauce that it comes with. The flavors are pretty good - I think the marinade could use a tinge more acidity, a little bit smokier (from fire roasted tomatoes, of course!) and perhaps dial back on the spice level. Overall, pretty satisfying. This was my hubby's favourite.\n\nEggplant parm - I like the fact that this pasty is brimming with vegetables but the crust totally holds (ie, it isn't soggy at all!). The combination of the marinara, mozarella and variety of vegetables makes this a very satisfying meal. This was my favourite.\n\nChicken pot pie - a little bit unbalanced in the flavour (it had a bit too strong celery taste in the pot pie and could have used a bit more carrot - bonus would be to add some umami to this dish), this was probably our least favourite of the three. The chicken/thyme gravy was a little bit too thick and was overly salty.\n\nService was quick and efficient. Our server was pretty nice, refilled our water glasses promptly even though she was the only one serving and she even offered to refill some of the dipping sauces for us even though we didn't need it.\n\nOverall, I was very satisfied by my visit here considering the level of cuisine, the service and the value (pasties set you back around $9+ pretip/tax). I would recommend this place for vegetarians - they really have an extensive menu for those looking to avoid meat. I look forward to returning and trying other items on their menu. 4-starred review.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "location of the shopping center is a little off putting but it is worth the trip!

He is 94, very stubborn, and only eats Italian and American food. He is a regular at Samstown Buffett and Olive Garden (which he thought was a little local joint with authentic Italian....boy was he surprised when I explained to him they were nationwide and almost as common as McDonalds.). \nAnyway, as soon as he saw the menu, he said, \"I don't think we can eat here.  There's nothing here we like.\", meaning him of course, because I eat everything. \n\nThe menu has a few soups, sides and salads, but everything else is basically a meal served in a hot pocket style bread wrapping. Almost like a pastry, but don't get it confused, because this is pasty with no R.  And they are real quick to correct you on that every time you mispronounce it too. \n\nSo, I ordered a cup of the Cream of Leek, Potato and Stilton soup at the urging of the waitress. You ask what is Stilton?  Well, so did I. The waitress said it was like a blue cheese...as she is explaining this, I was shaking my head and turning up my nose.  Then she said, yeah I don't like blue cheese either, but this is good. So I ordered it. \nMistake!  If you don't like blue cheese...don't get Stilton anything!  It actually had a pretty good flavor, but then the aftertaste of the blue cheese creeped into my mouth.  Yuk!  \nLuckily she took it off the order.  LOL!  Ok, so I don't eat EVERYTHING. ;)\n\nNext I ordered the potato chips, which were very well done. I also asked for plain, but could tell they had garlic on them. They were strangely hard on the outside, but still soft in the middle. I actually liked this texture  as weird as that is. The garlic was good, but I wanted to share with my Grandpa and he doesn't like garlic.  Didn't really matter, because he took one bite and was over the texture instantly. \n\nLastly the pasty I ordered was the bangers and mash.  It was pretty good. I loved the pastry outside of the bread. The mashed potatoes were creamy and the sausage had a good flavor. The waitress said the sausage was made in-house too. \n\nMy picky Grandpa ordered the chicken pot pie, which he really liked. HaHa, I told him he needs to venture out and try new things. \nHe kinda agreed, but I'm not stupid....I won't be taking him next door to Lotus of Siam anytime soon. \n\nI'll be back, because I really want to come and try some of the different options.

To even it out I gave them 3 stars since my first visit was a 5 and my second visit was a 2. \n\nOUR FIRST VISIT\ncouldn't have been better! We came here on a whim one night for dinner when we happened to just be driving around trying to find a place to eat. We walked in here and the place was completely empty, but we were greeted with big smiles and seated right away while another server was already filling up our glasses with water. Usually I find it a little awkward to be the only customers since the servers tend to just stare or or look annoyed and it also seems like the place is empty because it probably isn't good, but that wasn't the case for this place. The fact that we were alone in there actually made it quite nice since we got complete attention and excellent service. \n\nWe ordered the Nevada Chicken - Tender, boneless, chicken breast fillet in a light curry-peanut sauce for $7.95\nand\nPad Thai - Soft pan-fried translucent noodles cooked with chicken, shrimp, ground peanuts and ground chili pepper. Garnished with fresh bean sprouts for $7.95\n\nThe Nevada Chicken was so sexy! Juicy chicken breast with peanut sauce. It makes me salivate just thinking about it! It was exactly like the description.  It even came with a side of white rice which was nice since we didn't order any rice with our meal. We both loved it!\n\nThe Pad Thai I just couldn't get enough of. All of the different flavors and textures in it went together so well in my mouth, mmm! I loved the crunchiness of the peanuts and bean sprouts, it definitely added to the burst of flavors. \n\nNormally we would've ordered more than just two plates of food, like an appetizer and dessert and probably thai tea, but this was more than enough for us. We were able to finish it all without having to take anything home, which was good since we were staying at a hotel on the strip that night anyway. The portion filled us up just right and we were oh so satisfied!\n \n\nTHE SECOND VISIT\nPure disappointment... \n\nThe service was, well, lacking SERVICE. It took them at least 10 minutes to greet us and give us a place to sit. The place wasn't even full, probably just a 3rd of it was full and that was just on the left side where they were seating everyone. Their greeting wasn't exactly welcoming. We were standing at the front of the restaurant waiting to be seated and the girl just came up to us and said \"can I help you?\" WTH. It's a restaurant, I think it's an obvious reason as to why anyone would be in there, but I wasn't about to say \"yes you can help me by filling my stomach and quitting your job so I don't have to see your face again,\" so I just bit my tongue and said \"table for 3.\" \n\nWe were seated and we decided what to order right away since it was just off the lunch special menu, but it took forever to finally get our order relayed since the waitress just sat us then neglected us. It seemed as though she even avoided us while we were calling her at some points since she'd look at us and just turn away. She finally came and she just seemed to be in another dimension or something. We told her \"we want the pepper steak level 4\" then she said \"okay level 4, what level spicy?\" That was just confusing. We went back and forth a few times repeating what level we wanted then she'd repeat that same question. She got the rest of our order and left. \n\nI don't remember what else we ordered other than pepper steak and pad thai. That might've been it actually. We got to orders of pad thai since my bf and my brother both wanted their order spicy (level 8) and I can't go higher than a 4 lol. \n\nSince it took so long for the food to come, we decided we wanted to get an appetizer AND we also wanted our glasses of water filled since the cups were already empty for a while and the ice was starting to melt. We kept signaling to the waitress but she's just walk by and look the other way or look at us and look away, it was really awkward, we were beginning to wonder if we were just trippin' or if it was her. We all agreed it was her, ha. Maybe it was just that she was too young and couldn't handle multitasking. Whatever it was definitely didn't leave a good impression on us. \n\nThe pad thai was good, but not great like the first time we went.   The pepper steak I don't even remember, so it mustn't have been all that great. We never  get our appetizer, so I can't comment on that. \n\nIt kinda sucked because my boyfriend and I took my brother here to eat because we had such a good experience with bombass food the first time we came so we thought he'd love it too, but they totally flipped it on us and made it a bad experience with bad service and mediocre food. We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed.

We ordered the Pad See Ew ($9.95, and had some goofy name on the menu), the Green Curry Beef ($10.95), the Larb Pork ($9.96), the Chicken Fried Rice ($9.95), and the One Sun Beef jerky ($8.95).  Everything was ordered with \"medium spice\" and \"Thai style\".\n\nThe Pad See Ew was served without Chinese broccoli as an option. The sauce was some sort of a generic Chinese style teriyaki sauce.  The chicken was bland.  There was no spice, and even with gobs of their chili powder (which we had to ask for), there still wasn't much flavor or heat.  Pad See Ew is an easy dish, and somehow Thai Spice still makes it bland.  Unfortunately, this was the best dish of the meal.\n\nThe Green Curry with Beef was also a miss.  Lightly sweet and without much flavor at all, or spice, it was boring to eat.  Just plain boring.  The occasional bell pepper was the only thing that gave this dish any interesting flavor. I have had worst tasting curries, but this one was probably one of the blandest curries I have ever had.  What's the point of eating this again?\n\nThe Larb with Pork was border line gross.  It was the most offensive dish that we had, and one of my friends just plain couldn't stand it.  The flavor was off.  It had a lot of vinegar, along with a poorly balanced blend of herbs that were just totally unappealing.  Again, no heat at all to even cover up the bad flavor.  Do yourself a favor and don't order the larb here.\n\nThe chicken fried rice was unoffensive.  It was also bland as heck.  The chicken was dry, and there was no flavor to speak of.  Is this food for 5 year olds?\n\nYeah, the jerky wasn't good either.  The sauce was uninspiring and overly salty.  The meat tasted of poor quality.

The filet mignon/ground meat kabob combo were also near-perfect.  Also appreciated was the lack of skewers, which usually has the chicken or meat landing in my lap.

Unlike at a Mexican restaurant, where what they call salad is a tablespoon of shredded iceberg with a bit of chopped tomato, this one filled the plate to overflowing, chock-full of FRESH romaine, red lettuce, chopped tomato, sliced tomato, roasted red peppers, red onion, grilled zucchini, and whole Greek olives, green olives, and sliced black olives.

As on the previous visit, we ordered rice for one, salad for the other, intending to share both.  The waitress offered to have the kitchen divide it for us, and when the plates came out, it was if we weren't sharing at all - we each had so much rice (perfectly cooked) and salad (fresh and full of a variety of stuff), together with a substantial portion of the lamb, that we each took home enough for a second full meal.\n\nThe other friend is Israeli, and this is her comfort food.  She had a hankering for Liver and Onions.  If she hadn't been with us, it would have been another 5-star rating.  But her liver was way overcooked, and she didn't like it.  She did, however, love the hummus, which we ordered as a single side dish but had it as an appetizer.  It was a huge portion for $4.50.  (It costs more when ordered alone, but who'd go there and just order hummus?).\n\nI have to agree with XX, when he/she said: \" You walk in and can't tell whether or not they're open...\"  We went fairly late, and were sure it was closed -- until we walked in.

This place did just about everything it could think of to make me wish I never used an iphone app to find it. \n\nI went to Vegas this weekend to enjoy UFC 106 with some close friends. After Forrest Griffin made me happy I decided to top off the evening with something like The boiling Crab or the Crab hut. I used my friend's iPhone to find the nearest spot for us to indulge in some Cajun goodness. We got in a cab and hurried over to Cajun Crawfish. We arrived to find the place almost empty. We were sat and the waiter returned with our drinks. We ordered our usual and waited for about 15 minutes only to have the waiter return to our table to tell us they were out of corn on the cob....whaaaat?? ok ok ok...I can deal with that. But then we waited about another 30 minutes only to be confronted with the most flavorless crawfish and shrimp I have ever tasted in my life! Our potatoes come and they have no seasoning anywhere and are waaay undercooked. We sent the potatoes back to be cooked longer and they were still under cooked when the waiter brought them back. We ordered some steamed white rice and even that was horrible....how do you screw up rice? The sausage was undercooked, the crawfish was over cooked and lacked any flavor except spice. the shrimp was ok at best...a tad over cooked but still...ok. We tried to tell the female waitress about the potatoes and the rice only to find she doesn't speak English, so we were then stuck playing charades with the girl. After we were finished with our disaster of a dinner...we asked for wet naps. The lemon scented ones tend to cut the fishy smell out of your hands. Guess what?? No wet naps. \n\nWe agreed to call it quits for the evening and head back to the hotel. We asked the waiter to call a cab.....after asking every employee in the joint \"Do we have cab number?\" we decided to make use of the iphone once again and called our own cab. \n\nWe waited outside for our cab and noticed the sign for Cajun Crawfish stated \"Grand Opening\". Well, I don't know about \"grand\" but I guess the place is new. So here is my advice to the owners....shut down for a week and visit The Boiling Crab in LA area. Notice the flavor, the decor, the hospitable service, the flavor and the flavor or their food. Then come back to Vegas and regroup. There is no point in owning a below average establishment like this. When you have visitors that know what their food is supposed to taste like and visit your restaurant with certain expectations....they are just going to leave seriously unhappy and are going to tell all their friends about their piss poor experience. Not trying to be mean...but Cajun Crawfish is way under par. \n\nCajun Crawfish failed to deliver...in EVERY way possible. I will not go back and I will make sure that no one I care about makes the same mistake I did by going here. Waste of time, waste of money and there was a risk of food poisoning with the whole undercooked sausage thing. It's clear this place doesn't care about the quality of their food....looks like they are just happy enough to be open and have anyone walk through their doors. \n\n2 lb shrimp (1 mild and 1 medium) FAIL \n2 lb Crawfish (medium) FAIL \n12 practically raw potatoes FAIL \nno corn on the cob MAJOR FAIL \n24 undercooked sausage FAIL \n3 orders of slice bread GOOD \n2 order rice FAIL \n\nI would have been happier with Popeye's Chicken and Biscuits", "review_stars": 1, "review_votes": {"funny": 6, "useful": 6, "cool": 5}}, {"text": "We decided to give Cajun Crawfish a try.

I agree with Andy R.  OMG - the shrimp were huge from its head to its tail - as big as the distance between your thumb and your index finger!!  The shrimp were as thick as your thumbs!!!  They were indicated on the menu as Gulf Atlantic Shrimps.  I think they were just huge Tiger Prawns.  Make sure you order some rice and some bread to sop up the delicious sauce.  The sauce was unfortunately too little but we managed to sop up every little bit of sauce.  The sauce had roughly chopped up onions in it.   The rice was so fragrant; I think it's jasmine rice.

(They have a warning that says their \"spicy level is two levels higher than normal\".)  The Husband did ask ahead of time if the crawfish was big and fresh, and the waitress said it was.  She also pointed out the tank in the back so we could have a look.  (I did walk over there to take a peek and noticed they had lobster and clams in the tanks too.)  You also get one side of corn and potato for order two pounds or more of crawfish.\n\nWhen our order arrived in a silver bowl, we noticed a difference right away.  This wasn't the way we wanted our crawfish, and that was our mistake.  The Husband asked for some lime, salt and pepper to make a dipping sauce, but that couldn't help this crawfish.  Sure, they were large, but they were also dried out.  There was no head juice to suck out at all.  When you break the head off, you can tell there's something wrong immediately.  And the sauce in the bottom of the bowl is this watered down concoction of something or other.  I don't think it's as fresh as they say it is, the ones in the tank are just for show I think!    \n\nThe staff were friendly, and really anxious to refill our beverages.

My brother-in-law's been wanting to attend a LuckyRice Night Market event for a few years and was really excited that it came to Vegas.  We bought tickets via TicketMaster (love the new Passbook feature for the iPhone!) and were ready to go!\n\nWe arrived just after 8 PM and the entrance didn't have the scanner for Passbook, so a young man was kind enough to escort us to another entrance.  On the way there, we were offered drinks:  Snake in a Glass and Lemongrass and Elderflower Collins.  I really enjoyed the freshness and subtle floweriness of the Lemongrass and Elderflower Collins.  My sister said the Snake in a Glass was her favorite of the two - not overly sweet with just a bit of a bite.  BOMBAY SAPPHIRE EAST GIN was well represented!\n\nOnce we got scanned in we walked around a bit, and decided to try the White Chocolate Curry from POPPY DEN.  I was going to wait because I thought it was a desert, but they encouraged me to give it a try and I'm so glad I did!  It was still warm and had a layer of flavors that added a nice complexity to the dish.  I was especially happy to discover that POPPY DEN is in Tivoli Village, so it's now on my list of places to try.\n\nWe then moved down the Boulevard to try RENE ORTIZ + LAURA SAWICKI'S Angry Bear Prawn with peppers, soy beans, daikon radish and caramelized garlic.  Nice!  Anytime you add caramelized garlic...\n\nNext up, Tuk Tuk's steamed snapper w/ lemongrass.  I now have a reason to visit Austin. Ser-i-ous-ly.\n\nWe headed back downstairs and ASAHI was serving a Kuronama Black - I thought it would be heavy and was pleasantly surprised.  And I got an Asahi t-shirt - yeah!\n\nNext - of course we tried the Bordeaux wines.  They had a nice selection of whites and a Sauternes that I saved for later in the evening (pretty little dessert wine).\n\nHave you ever had a short rib gyoza?  Me neither.  Until we tried it at STK's booth and it was served with wasabi sesame ponzu.  I need more.\n\nAnother great local place - CHADA THAI serving two items:  an artistically created, delicate spring roll and crab curry with noodles.  Sigh.  And guess what???  They serve a lunch with a wine tasting.  Oh yes.  We're definitely doing THAT.\n\nThanks to our Boston friend, KRISTEN KISH (Menton, Boston), for serving lobster with melon, celery and smoked  (yes!) brioche.  And yes, I grabbed a glass of CHAMPAGNE NICOLAS FEUILLATTE to pair with the lobster.  My husband tried the rose and I tried the brut.  Both were nice, but I have to say I preferred the rose.\n\nAnd then there was a woman walking around with cones full of seasoned pork chicharones.  They were really tasty - crunchy with a nice chili-like flavor (ends up it was curry).  Back at the booth they were serving...sea urchin.  Go big or go home.  It was so delicate and so delicious, with a slight smoky flavor.  I had no idea WICKED SPOON was below the Boulevard Pool at the Cosmopolitan.  Yes, another local joint to put on our list!\n\nOf course, we had to wait in line for Endo's famous pork cheeks and chicken on a skewer.  Endo was so accommodating and his food is 'da bomb!  If you haven't been, imagine small plates of a nice variety of meats and veggies, great selection of fresh fish (love the sushi salad).  Must go to try the absolute best grilled tomatoes you've ever had.  Seriously.\n\nWe then headed straight to the bar to try an Eastern Promise & a Professor Plum, which was a lovely lavender.\n\nOver on the south side of the Boulevard we decided to try the sirloin wrapped in cabbage with garlic and fresh cilantro by LEAH COHEN (Pig & Khao, NYC).  The sirloin was tender and tasty, and the cabbage smelled like cabbage.  Lol - the garlic is always appreciated, and the fresh cilantro really freshened it up.\n\nI saw someone walking around with popsicles, and sure enough it was THE NEAPOLITAN serving a variety of adult frozen goodness.  I snagged a watermelon popsicle - it had a dusting of salted chili powder and bits of cucumber.  Refreshing!  Love the Neapolitan!\n\nWe wrapped it up with a barbecue pork taco and a salt air margarita (way to go Jose Andres!) from CHINA POBLANO (Eric Suniga).  Tasty, savory, pork in a soft, pliable wrap.  The margarita was so much fun!  Think margarita with a briney foam on top.\n\nOk, I did try one more tempting drink.  Drunken noodles.  This is the most clever drink I've had, and definitely the most fun (tough competition).  Imagine japanese gelatin flavored and shaped to look like noodles and an egg.  You got it!  A drink that looked like a ramen dish - how cool is that???  There were sweetened, crunchy pineapple bits on top, and the gummy-like fun shapes were slightly sweet.  This was a dangerous, oh-so-good concoction.\n\nWe didn't try everything (we were so stuffed) and definitely felt the experience was well worth it.

So before I had that deer look in the head lights for too long I said I'd like something chicken with mole and the woman behind the counter said oh you want Mole Negro Con Arroz and pointed to a sign. I said, yes thank you that sounds good.\n\nMy husband said, \"what would you recommend?\" She told him about Memelitas and Enmoladas.

We received HOT Fresh Made Corn tortillas, a trio of salsas , chips and our two entrees.\n\nThe salsas were UNLIKE any other salsas I had anywhere else. We received a tasty tomatillo, a refreshing creamy avocado and the most interesting salsa was the Chili de Arbol (it's a Mexican bird's beak chili)  that also was the most spicy , smokey but not too smokey unlike your normal smokey sauce and it almost was creamy.\n\nI received a very carefully cooked seasoned chicken leg that was falling off the bone moist.  But the skin was a throw away as is was moist and melting off.  The Mole sauce that blanketed the chicken was  the most well balanced mole sauce I ever had and that's why that sauce was delicious. A bit spicy, not too much chocolate, all the spices and ingredients carefully blended so you couldn't tell them apart.  My rice was fluffy moist and fresh, it tasted like it was cooked in house made chicken stock.\n\nI'm not really sure if my husband received the Memelitas or the Enmoladas but what he received were shredded white meat chicken and cheese in folded corn tortillas that was topped with the same dark mole sauce.

Inside, it is much nicer than I had expected, although more authentic, casual Mexican than anything upscale.\n\nI went here specifically for the mole negro, one of my favorite dishes.  I got the one with three enchiladas, stuffed with chicken, smothered in mole. I believe it's called enmolado.   Very generous amount of mole, filling the plate, double the amount of mole I have ever gotten in any other restaurant.  It was delicious, filled with generous chicken, overflowing with mole negro sauce.  The owner/proprietor came out to see how I liked it and brought me a free serving of smooth guacamole.

This is definitely a small, neighborhood,  mom & son-run authentic Mexican restaurant, specializing in Oaxacan cuisine, and I use the word \"cuisine\" deliberately.\n\nOrdering at the counter is a bit challenging because there are a lot of dishes listed on the overhead board that you don't find in the usual Mexican restaurant, and the sweet woman who owns and runs the place has adequate but not too strong English.  The effort is well worth it, and they do have a printed menu available that you could just take to your table.\n\nI was the only customer late in the day, so very quiet.  There was a tv on in the corner with a Spanish-language show, but so low that I wasn't really aware of it.\n\nIn addition to the very warm, friendly service and pleasant atmosphere, the menu lists a large number of Oaxacan dishes that are new to me.  This is not your typical Mexican restaurant; it is not your typical menu, although you will find some familiar items.  There is much to explore if your are a foodie, and based on my one experience, well worth it.  I would have the mole dishes every week, if I could.

One who listens to their customers and takes things to heart. Now if this is how the owner acts, I can only assume all his employees will have the same positive attitude.\n\nSome random info. At the time of this review there is a 20 dollar for 10 Groupon so take full advantage. They have free wifi and the code is on the wall above you when you come in. On Sundays, if you come wearing sandals or flip flops, you get free chips and salsa with your order. They take cards. Their dining room is spacious and equipped with napkins and some kind of good tasting Hawaiin sauce. They have two separate solo bathrooms for men and women.  And lastly, they have a drive thru!\n\nSo a big mahalo to Chris and his staff.

Hubby couldn't get over how moist the grilled chicken pieces were; and I would fight anybody for more of their Kalua pig! Can't wait to go try the steak and fish.\nBe judicious with the many, many choices of add-ons. For instance, I won't combine the nori-studded rice with the Kalua pork again. Don't want anything to overpower that melt-in-your-mouth smoky pig. The rice is probably better with the fish; but the black beans went just fine with pork and chicken. Wow, the fresh salsas--they were awesome on everything. And they also put some amazing hot sauces (Pickapeppa and Mango-Habanero, yum!) on the tables too.\nThe $20 Groupon was enough to cover both our meals, including soft drinks and a dessert, so that tells you how reasonable the prices are.

All i can say is fantastic food!!. Located on Rainbow and Sahara next to McDonalds. Why so many people stuff down nasty Mickey D's when all this fresh goodness is right next door for the same price is beyond me.\nThe building is very tastefully done. Nice seating area on the patio outside, and very bright and inviting on the inside. I love the old airline posters of Hawaii hanging on the wall, and the old Elvis music was relaxing just like you were in Hawaii for real . We were very warmly greeted by the employees with a friendly Aloha. Forgive me that i forgot to get any of their names, but they were all so friendly. What a nice change of pace to have such nice customer service. Since it was our first time, they offered us free samples of the Kalua Pork and the Huli Huli chicken. both delicious and full of flavor.\nThe ordering line is basically set up like a Chipotle if you are familiar with them.\nFIRST: pick from either a burrito, rice bowl, or 3 taco option.\nSECOND: pick you're meat. Kalua Pig, Huli Huli Chicken, Pulehu Steak, Grilled Veggies or Grilled Fish.\nTHIRD: Pick your toppings: Black Beans, Grilled veggies with green onions, Seaweed rice, lettuce, cabbage etc.\nFOURTH: Salsa Time: Charred Pineapple Verde(very mild,) Mango and Roasted Corn (delicious) and Tomato with Grilled Maui Onion. (Medium).\nLAST STEP: a few additional toppings such as cheese, sour cream, guacamole, jalapeno's, limes.\nNOTE: additional toppings do cost extra, so keep that in mind when building your meal.\n\nMy wife ended up getting the rice bowl, which was a really good size portion. She paired that with Huli Huli Chicken which is so delicious. She put on various toppings such as lettuce, cheese, and got the Salsas in a couple of small containers so she could put the right amount on herself. I can't remember what else she got because i was so involved with my order. Total tunnel vision lol. I went with the 3 taco option so i could try a few of the meats. I opted for the soft shell and got the Kalua Pig, Huli Huli Chicken, and The Pulehu steak. The Chicken is grilled and flavorful, the Pig is declious and juicy, and the Steak has a sort of sweet unique flavor like i have never had. i loaded them up so much, she could barely fold the tortilla. The food is flat out delicious and above all so very fresh, like you would make at home if you knew how lol. And whatever you do, don't forget the coconut bark for dessert. A sort of Hawaiian smore's concoction?? I don't know but it was ridunkulessly good. Nice piece of chocolate with shaved coconut on top, kind of a graham cracker?? in the middle and a salty caramel bottom. The salty evens out the sweet chocolate, and will turn you immediately into a crack-head for this stuff wanting to take a couple pounds home to stash for later.\n\nOverall can't say enough good things about this new restaurant.

I was determined not to mention \"Hawaiian Chipotle\" for the fear of it being pass\u00e9, but really it turns out it's the best way to describe it.   I actually think they should have just fully played up to this fact by incorporating Chipotle into the name of the restaurant or something.   Hau'olipotle!   ChipotLEI!    I'll be here all week.\n\nOn my first visit I had a gameplan to get an order of tacos so I could sample all the main meats (Chicken, Pig, Steak), and even though they awesomely asked if I wanted to try any/all of the meats prior to ordering, I stuck to the plan and ordered the tacos.  Like you've read from other reviews it's just like Chipotle/Zabas where you start with a taco/burrito/bowl/salad decision and then choose meats/accompaniments to go with it.  On top of the meats I tried the seaweed rice, the corn salsa, the tomato salsa, and some jalapenos.  They also have the standard items like cheese, sour cream, guac.    I had the choice of crunchy corn or soft flour tortillas and went crunchy corn.   Of the meats the pig stood out to me by far.   The steak and chicken both seemed to have a bit of sweet teriyaki flavor to it which I'm generally not a fan of.   They tasted fine for what they are, but the pig was so juicy and flavorful that I've been craving it since that day.   The seaweed rice didn't really taste much different than regular rice, but maybe that was because it was on tacos and there wasnt much of it.  Most all of the other fixins I got were standard, which is not a bad thing but it leaves for very little to write about.  Pro-tip: the jalapenos here are fresh and extremely spicy.   I've already witnessed them leave a coworker in literal tears.   Be warned.   \n\nTo close out the first visit I tried some of the much heralded coconut bark.   This was probably ill-advised with my lactose intolerance but to add credence to the review I felt it was necessary.   You're welcome.   It was as good as everyone says it is.   So much so that you know when you're in a situation with a few people sharing several pieces of something, and it gets to that last piece and there's the tug of war of \"you have it\" \"no I insist!\".   I ended the tug of war after one \"no you can have it\" uttered by my friend.   So delicious it made me a greedy jerk.   Highly recommended\n\nThe 2nd visit I went to an all pig burrito with most of the same fixins I got previously.  I didn't really feel like my burrito was made all that well to be honest, especially when I asked for all 3 salsas and got them separated into thirds on my burrito by the gentleman making it.   It was almost too funny for me to even correct.   Are there people in this world who eat burritos like that?   I wanted all of them melding together throughout but instead it was like a salsa taste test.   Also the burrito just seemed really short and stubby and I kinda felt they skimped a little on the meat, whereas my friend's burrito last time looked completely stuffed.   It was still incredibly delicious and I can't really expect every cog of the assembly line to be consistent this early in the stages.\n\nI can easily see this being upgraded to 5 stars once it does.

We were asked if we had been to Braddah's before, then given a nice sample of their kalua pig.  Really like home!  So needless to say we stayed for a meal.\n\nBraddah's concept is almost identical to that of Chipotle's with their food-building line.  You start at one end and place your order, and along the way down the counter you choose what you want in your entree.  Menu items are very similar to Chipotle's as well, simple and easy to comprehend.  But with more Hawaii flavor infused into the menu.  \n\nChoose from your menu staples of burritos, bowls, salads, or tacos.  Then you go down each station to choose your protein, rice and/or beans, salsa, dressing (if you have a salad), and fresh fixing choices.  Then it all gets wrapped up or placed on real plates!  Kind of a nice touch, since it gives you that homey-type feel.  Of course you can get it to go if you need to.\n\nFor proteins you can choose from:\n-Kalua pig (damn yummy like out of the IMU)\n-Pulehu steak\n-Huli Huli chicken\n-Grilled fish\n-Grilled veggies\n\nYou have a choice of black or pinto beans, and the rice has either nori or furikake in it which is pretty good.  Hot rice, furikake, and shoyu...a meal in itself!\n\nFor salsa choices you get:\n-Charred pineapple verde\n-Mango & roasted corn\n-Tomato with grilled Maui onion (LIKE since I'm from Maui)\n\nDressings make for salads include a papaya buttermilk ranch, and a roasted sesame gingerette.\n\nFresh fixing items to include with your order:\n-Sour cream\n-Romaine\n-Cheese\n-Cilantro\n-Cabbage (great with grilled fish)\n-Jalapeno\n-Guacamole with pink Hawaiian salt (for a small fee)\n\nTons of flavor combinations!  Like a hula dancer in your mouth!  Hmm...that worked out better in my head then on paper.  I had a burrito with Huli Huli chicken, pineapple verde, tomato with grilled Maui onion salsa, sour cream, cheese, and extra romaine.  I thought it would be too much for the chicken to come through but POW!  That Huli Huli chicken tasted exactly like I remember from my 'hana bada' days (that's kiddie time to you non-locals).  Sweet, salty, tangy, just damn delicious.  Very good burrito, made even better with the Pickapepper hot sauce they get from Jamaica!  That sweet and heat flavor added some good kick to my palette.  I would eat jars of that stuff.\n\nWe also had a kalua pig burrito too and it was pretty stellar as well.  That smokey flavor of the pork complimented the rest of the ingredients nicely.  Good stuff.  Fish tacos were ono too, very comparable to the ones at a place like Wahoo's.  Fresh.\n\nThe only complaint I have about Braddah's is sometimes the servings can be a tad on the 'keiki' side.  Especially with the bowls and salads.  Please, most of us people from Hawaii are big!  I'm a big boy!  I want a big boy serving!  I can understand how food costs rise constantly.  I only suggest you put a bit more lettuce and rice/beans when you guys make a salad or bowl.  Tastes good, just want more!  So please, maybe pile over the top of the bowl!\n\nSince it was our first time to Braddah's we were given samples of their only dessert, coconut bark.  Shiz...this stuff is like CRACK!  I don't even like sweets!  Sweet, silky, crunchy, coco-nutty all at the same time.  Tasty explosion!  No wonder it won 'Best Dessert' at this past year's Bite of Las Vegas, well deserved.  If you like spicy, add a dash of that Pickapepper hot sauce on top (I kid you not), and be amazed.  Super yum-yum.\n\nI bought a Groupon for Braddah's so I will be back again sometime soon.  I thought the drive was a bit far for us so we would wait a bit.

They have tacos, burritos, bowls and salad so it does have an air reminiscent of chipotle but the food flavor index is vastly different. The choices of meat include a sweet marinated steak, a mild but tasty chicken, fish to die for and Kalua pig that was very good as well but I'm not much of a pork fan.

It takes traditional Hawaiian meats and combines them with Tex Mex's tacos, burritos, and bowls.\n       - Chipotle - I'd describe this place as a Hawaiian Chipotle. The menu and ordering style is the same. The flavor however, is different.\n       - Rice - Rather than the normal cilantro/lime rice at Chipotle, they have rice with sprinkles of seaweed. It's quite delicious.\n       - Taste - If you're not sure which meat to get, I'd recommend asking for a sample, that way you're knowing what you're getting into.\n**Ordered**\n       - Huli Huli Chicken - I can't get over how flavorful and perfectly cooked this chicken is. I went with an actual Hawaiian who told that Hawaii Huli Huli Chicken was one of the pinnacles of Hawaiian food and she said this chicken ranks up there as well.\n       - Kalua Pig - Kalua Pig usually is pretty salty. This one is no exception. It goes well in a bowl, but I wouldn't recommend it in a burrito.\n       - Pulehu Steak - The steak seemed a little under seasoned. It might of been since I had the Kalua Pig first.\n       - Grilled Fish - The grilled fish tacos we had were delicious. The fish was flaky and cooked to perfection.\n       - Coconut Bark - Unfortunately, I didn't like this as much. It's a lot of chocolate and was a bit too rich for me. A couple bites and I was going into a sugar meltdown.\n**Recommendations**\n       - I'd recommend this place if you like Hawaiian fusion or Chipotle.

I was torn on which meat to choose for my tacos, so the man behind the counter said I could mix and match them. Cool! I ended up going with chicken, pig and steak tacos and paying the extra $1.35 for guac on them. A lot of places would charge for the guacamole per taco, but I was just charged the 1 price and got a generous portion on all 3 tacos. The tacos were delicious! The charred pineapple verde adds a nice flavor addition, the meat is tender and has great flavor, the tortilla was soft and good and the price was right for what I got. The guacamole is worth buying just as a side to have with chips, but I have to admit that if there was some sort of Hawaiian pink salt in it, I didn't see it or taste anything except for fresh yummy guac.

After finishing my excellent food, I saw this purple and white ribbon pinned to the menu. I asked the manager (owner?) about it, and he quite proudly shared with me that it was for winning best dessert at the Bite of Las Vegas. He even boasted that they beat out all those fancy chefs who \"went to school\" to learn to make dessert.\n\nLoathe to let a great opportunity slip, I stepped up to the register and ordered the coconut bark. Wow. I'm not normally a coconut fan, but this wasn't overtly coconut-y. There's coconut shavings on a hard chocolate layer, then a middle white layer which was more likely coconut as well, and a salted soft caramel layer at the bottom. It's pretty dang sweet, which is too my liking, and isn't too hard to crunch through. Only problem is that I only bought one box and there's very few pieces of this deliciousness. After eating a chunk just now, I only have one piece left for another day.\n\nBy the way, the non-dessert menu is also worth coming here for. I had three tacos, and following the excellent idea of Christie L., I got to try three meats (huli huli chicken, kalua pork, pulehu steak), plus three different salsas. I'd probably go for pork or steak (just like at the other fresh burritos places) and definitely stick to the mango and corn salsa, but the pineapple verde and tomato with Maui onion options aren't bad. They also have two hot sauces available at bottles at the tables. You know I'm kinda a fan of sweet, and I found myself augmenting my tacos with quite a bit of the raspberry and jalapeno sauce. The unlabeled guava sauce was a little too hot for my delicate taste buds unfortunately.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent 4.5 star concept that the coconut bark certainly bumped up to an unquestionable 5.

I opted to try out the 3 taco meal on my first go at Braddah's.  For my three choices I picked the veggie, chicken, and fish options and had them put pretty much all the \"fixins\" on it.  I was excited to try out the maui onion they offered and it wasn't quite as good as I wanted it to be as I didn't taste the flavor I've come to know and love.  But, I looked past it and settled on the flavors of the veggies, chicken, and fish contents; the chicken being the best out of the three.  It's not very often that you find huli huli style chicken here in LV (unless I'm not looking hard enough, which wouldn't really surprise me), so it was a nice flavor to re-visit after being out of the islands for a while.  The fish was also quite grubbin' but I found that the guac and sour cream overpowered the taste of the fish and I couldn't fully enjoy it.  I'll put it down as a mental note to try guac and sour cream on my tacos next time.  Got to try some of the prized coconut bark and it is as good as they say it is (and I'm not much of a dessert guy so that's saying a lot).  If I had to describe it, the coconut bark is just like a Twix bar with a healthy infusion of coconut flavor and texture.  Try it out, I'm sure you won't regret it.\n\nOverall, Braddah's Island Style is a good grub option when you're hungry and jonesin' for a little bit of island flavor.  Braddah's style is reminiscent of back home but it doesn't quite hit the mark.  However, that is definitely not a bad thing as it is tasty and I enjoyed the lunch experience I had while visiting.

Well, I finally got to find out for myself.  Yes, when you walk in it's almost like Chipotle.  Your meals are made in an assembly line fashion, it's fast food, and the prices are similar.  \n\nThe process is simple...select your meats (Kalua Pork, Steak, Huli Huli Chicken, Veggies, Fish, or Shrimp).  Then choose whether you want your meats in a bowl with rice, in a salad, a burrito, and even a taco.  Then after this, you select all the extras like sour creams, beans, guac, etc.  For me, my decision was easy.  I wasn't feeling a burrito or taco.  I also wasn't doing a salad or rice bowl. So, I chose just a side of steak and a side of chicken.  I thought both meats were a bit greasy and lacking some flavor.  I know Chipotle isn't any better when it comes to grease, but at least there's a little taste there.  I still managed to down my dish because I don't believe in quitting.  My gf got steak with rice and beans. She also had to get their coconut bark.  Might as well, especially since they're known for it.  I had a piece and thought that it was pretty good.  It's pretty much a toffee tasting, Almond Roca tasting, sweet piece of candy.  That one piece was probably the highlight.  \n\nMy gf had a $20 Groupon for our meals and we were originally sticker shocked that just two bowls, 2 drinks, and coconut bark was over $22.  Something just didn't add up.  When I got home, I realized why.  Instead of Braddah's charging me for a side of chicken and a side of steak, they charged me for a full bowl.  Yeah, we were over-charged about $2.  I'm not going broke because of this, but it's the principle.  \n\nOverall, with a recent 5 Star ROTD for Braddah's and some of the hype I'm seeing, I have to say that I was a little disappointed.

But here's a quick breakdown:\nFood quality: A\nCreativity: B+/A-, yes it's a knockoff of Chipotle but the food is amazing and the executive chef's new handmade, preservative-free sauces are phenomenal.\nCleanliness/quality of premises: A\nService/quality of staff (minus the owner): A\n\n I like the premise of this place: keep it simple, use a presentation that people are used to but with an island flair. And it works. There set-up is a lot like Chipotle: pick what style of food you want, choose your meats or opt for vegetarian and then pick your sides. And I must say, their Huli Huli Chicken and their steak are good and their Kalua Pig is amazing. And, as mentioned above, their Exec. Chef, I forgot his name, makes great/creative sauces regularly and there's a new one all the time. \n            I was definitely a fan of this spot and promoted it to everybody I knew. \nWhat changed? In short: the owner and his attitude/passive-aggressive demeanor. What happened: Myself, my gf and my brother went for dinner one night because I had been there 3 times prior and really wanted them to try it. We get there, order and everything is cool. Now, nearly every time I had come here, the sauce situation was different. The first two trips: they had like one sauce per table (a Pik-a-Pepper sauce I think) and the third time is when they rolled out these handmade creations. And each table seemed to have one of each of the handmade sauces. This particular time, none of the tables around us had any sauces on them. Since the sauces were like 40% of why I wanted to come back again, I looked around and noticed a rack with several bottles of each sauce. I figured: hey, they switch it up each time...maybe they put them on this one rack so they have to waste ingredients making a bottle of each sauce for each table. So I go and grab them for our table. Cool. A minute later, another customer in the same predicament went to grab sauces and was informed that those bottles on the rack were for sale and that there are bottles floating around that say \"Table\" on them for customer use. Of course, I and my group felt bad. But right after, the guy come over to the table and before he said anything, we said \"We just heard you tell them and we're so sorry...we'll pay for them. It's not a big deal, they're worth whatever the cost.\" His response: \"So the wasn't big enough huh?\" We apologized again as he was walking away. He came right back with a purple sharpie to right \"Table\" on our bottles, overtly suggesting that now he can't sell these and he has to use them for other customer. We apologized again and he said, with an obviously forced smile, \"Don't worry. I'm the owner, it's my place. I just want my customers to be happy.\" We replied, \"Are you sure, man?\" He says, \"Whatever makes you happy.\" I had been apologetic up to this point, but now knowing that he was manager kind of ticked me off. He left again, and then we looked at this sign...I kid you not...that sign was in like 10 pt font....we were the closest table to the rack and couldn't read it from our table. (Which btw, is not only bad for avoiding people misusing the bottles but also is a bad way to promote that your sauces are for sale). As we were finishing up, he comes back again with a new sign, still in 10 pt font, and put the sign ON TOP of the bottles, so nobody can grab them without seeing it. \nSeriously dude? We messed up, that was admitted and we were willing and able to pay for it so as not to cheat an up-and-coming business but your attitude and demeanor, for being the owner, makes us not only never want to come back but to warn the folks t o which we previously promoted your biz. If it was an employee that was rude, fine, I'd excuse it but I cannot bring myself to support a place when the owner was directly rude. Here's how it should have went down, even if we didn't offer to pay for them, you eat the cost of those bottles ($21), be cool about it since it was a genuine mistake, wait til we leave and then make whatever changes you need to. Instead, you have to eat the cost of those bottles anyways, but your passive-aggressive manner has now lost my business and others' as well. Your staff was amazing and really does embody the laid back and friendly island spirit...but you on the other hand...need to learn how to embody the \"Mahalo\" vibe that you aim to promote.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 8, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "The service is FANTASTIC!

You also have a lot of similar add-on options like black beans and grilled veggies, and later, an awesome guac.\n\nLike Chipotle, the protein options here are tasty- but I can find a chicken burrito on nearly every corner. I can't find huli huli chicken or kaluah pig very easily at all- and here, both are phenomenally well done!\n\nBut what makes this place really stand out, in addition to the tasty island flavor, is the service- when I walk into a place and am greeted by the owner himself, it means something to me. Chatted with the guy for a bit and he is clearly dedicated to this business and it's success- this is not another place where the owner is MIA and leaves a manager in charge of running things. He's right there, interacting with everyone who walks through the door. Major props.\n\nAnd the food doesn't disappoint! I was offered samples of the pork and chicken when I walked in- both were delicious, but I ultimately went with the kaluah pork salad bowl, lite on the seaweed rice, plus black beans and grilled veggies, both the corn salsa and the tomato/onion salsa, a sprinkle of cheese and cilantro, and a side of guac.\nIt was amazing. The meat is tender, plentiful and flavorful, the veggies are fresh and not overcooked, the corn salsa is mild and adds a good extra punch to the dish, and the tomato-onion salsa adds a tiny bit of heat. Don't be turned off by the \"spicy\" label, it's not bad at all. \n\nAnd the portion size is humongous. I can put away quite a bit of food, but only half of my salad. I used my fork to take additional scoops of guac every few bites, and it really added an extra dimension to the dish- the bright acidity and slight saltiness were great.\n\nIf you look closely, up by the soda dispensers, there are various bottled sauces and salsas to add that extra bit of island flavor to your dish- and they're not just a selection of various bottles. Oh no. They're Braddah's Island Style-brand bottles with what I can only assume is the company's own sauces- a pineapple jalapeno one added a splash of sweetness and spice to mine, but I steered clear of the mango habanero- sounded like a dangerous territory for my tastebuds!\n\nAll in all, I'm very pleased with this place.

Hawaiian food is all about bright and bold flavors with contrasting textures and colors, and I felt like it was Chipotle with a mere Hawaiian twist whereas I'd rather be commenting that this was like Hawaiian food served in the style and accessibility of Chipotle.  Perhaps since they are a budding new business, ingredients need to be kept within a certain budget, but I hope to see them expand to have more interesting options such as poke, opakapaka, korean short -ribs, or spam as additional protein options in the form of nachos or their burritos/bowls, and something with a wasabi or taro element since those are all popular flavors from the island.

And I so wish I could like it as much as four stars but I'm not sure that I do.  I'm really on the fence with this one.  Lets start with the positives.  Upon entering I was offered a nice Hawaiian style welcoming into the restaurant.  Mahalo to them for that.  I was asked if it was my first visit and I said yes.  With that I was offered a sample of the kalua pig and huli huli chicken.  Both were very good though I don't always care for pork.  This was on the oily side but still had a great initial flavor.  It is the porky after taste I don't care for.  The chicken on the other hand was a stand out with a sort of sweet and salty taste with a hint of grill char.  So I selected the huli huli chicken to fill my burrito.  When I ordered a burrito I was disappointed to see a generic Mission brand flour tortilla pulled out of the bag.  I mean seriously $7 for a burrito in an 8 inch tortilla?  It turns out they ran out of their usual jumbo tortillas.  So alright, I'll let this one slide.  Next came a very carefully measured spoon of seaweed rice (awesome flavor BTW) and an equally measured spoon of chicken.  It was a new guy making my order and he was being very cautious to the point of me feeling like I was getting ripped off.  But with the addition of the black beans, two kinds of salsa (roasted pine apple and corn varieties) and some shredded cheese I realized just how much was packed into this little tortilla.  There was so much in fact that it could not be fully rolled.  One of the burrito veterans came over for the assist and rolled an extra tortilla around the first and got a nice tightly tucked buritto.  When I reached the register I ordered a can of Hawaiian green tea and was asked if I wanted coconut bark.  I declined the bark as I don't even know what it is.  Not that it matters.  I am not a coconut fan any how.  So I paid and found a table in the corner and took my first bite of an Island Style burrito and honeslty I was not blown away.  Beneath the rice, beans and salsa the flavor of the chicken was lost.  I'm not saying it was a bad burrito but all together it lacked something.  The salsa could have been hotter.  I realize that I got the mild and medium salsas but there just wasn't much to them.  Mostly what I could taste in the burrito was the seaweed rice.  I do love the taste of seaweed so that was nice but overall it was nothing special.  My other issue is the limited menu.  They specialize in burritos, tacos, salads and bowls.  They also seem to have chips and guacamole.  What I really wish they had is musubi but I guess that doesn't quite fit their business model.  I think I will give them another try some time.  Perhaps I'll try another protien other than chicken.  It is my understanding they have steak and fish too though neither were offered as a sample.  I would like to give the steak a try though.

In the meantime, they offered me a sample of their meat and I took it up. I haven't had this type of service for a long time. Then they took my order. I got 3 soft tacos with rice and beans, and a drink. \n\nOn my tacos I got Hula Hula Chicken, Kalua Pig, and Palehu Steak. All were very good, but a few problems: 1) If you order a portion of your mean to be the Steak or Fish, you get charged as if your entire order was that--which is extra. 2) The Kalua Pork, while the best meat here, tastes like it's bathing in lard (which is good, kinda). It's just saturated with liquid fat, so do avoid if you're on a diet!\nI only got salsa for topping, and I tried the three different--free--salsas they had. The pineapple and tomato/onion salsa were overpowering and I couldn't taste the meat with them in the tacos. The corn one was good. They would be great on anything else, just not with the meat. Leaves me questioning if I should have left them out.\n\nMy biggest complaint of food is with the sides. I had rice and beans with the side, and they were TERRIBLE. \nThe beans were like straight out of a can. I don't know if they make their own black beans, but they taste like any black beans you can dump from a can.\nThe rice, while you can tell is made in-house, is the worse. It's some kind of white/wild rice with some of the shell still on it, with some \"seaweed\" spice. This would be great if it was boiled or steam loosely, if the rice wasn't made Japanese/sticky-rice style. By making it sticky, the rice turns to just globs of messy, weird rice. With Japanese sticky rice, this is great as the rice tastes clean, and \"pure\" (hard to explain). But with this, the rice tastes dirty and just unappetizing. \nAVOID these. Several other customers after me--more experienced--didn't touch them for this reason.\n\nI do have to give mad props for having apple juice on the fountain drinks. That's something I've never seen before, and I love apple juice!\nThey do have two side sauces, which taste like concentrated artificial juice drinks with some hot sauce in them. While good, just doesn't sit right with me.\n\nThe service, was meh~. You're served from the counter--Subway style--which means the meat and all the sides are sitting out the entire time, pre-cooked and all. Then, the service ends about there. You get your own drinks, and leave your plates on the table. For the price I would have paid--if not for the coupon I had--this would have been pretty bad.\n\nMY BIGGEST COMPLAINT: Price. I can't see spending $10.25 on what I got. Three OK tacos, terrible rice and beans, and a fountain drink, with little to no service, for $10. I just don't see it. I can dine out for that price, and get much better and more food elsewhere--just not \"Hawaiian\" style. With the $5 for $10 coupon I got from Yelp, it made it worth it, and I'm satisfied. I'm just moved enough to pay $10 for everything. \n\nCome here if you've got the groupons or Yelp coupon, or if you really want to try this place.

I'm not going to lie, I was not a fan of the food at first. The main one being that the actual temperature of the food wasn't piping hot like I enjoy. I think all of the veggies and cold salsas took away from the warmth of the meat. I had the HuliHuli chicken burrito with seaweed rice, fajita veggies, corn salsa, and guac. The chicken was seasoned well but it was a bit on the cold side for a burrito. In your defense we did come in about 15 minutes before closing and maybe I got the last batch of chicken.\nAfter much debate my boyfriend drug me back into this location (He's a HUGE fan of Braddahs) to give it one more try. I was honest with the young lady working and she asked lots of questions about what I did not like on my first visit and was determined to fix it..... she talked me into something different.\nThis time around I had a three taco plate. 1 Kahluah Pig and 2 steak tacos and  OH MYYYYYY.......

As a Hawaiian who's super passionate about food, it's didn't take long to hear about this place. My impression was that this was a Hawaiian joint taking a Mexican fusion approach. I wanted to visit this place to see how accurate that was. \n\nRolling up to Braddah's, I thought it was super cute! Yellow awning type roof, outside seating with bright yellow umbrellas. I knew the inside wouldn't disappoint as well. The color scheme is green and yellow, a very common combo from my hometown on the Big Island. My past schools had the same color scheme and a lot of housing tend to represent the same combo. The walls were beautifully adorned with Hawaii prints, maps and other artwork. Hawaiian music played over the speakers bringing a laid back vibe to the restaurant. The staff was pretty young, but full of the Aloha spirit. Kenny, a long time employee is someone I met through the Hawaiian community here in Vegas and seems to really embody the Hawaiian mentality. It made me feel like I was visiting a place back home in Hawaii! \n\nThe food choice was really creative! I felt like I was visiting the Hawaiian version of Chipotle or Cafe Rio! For step 1, you basically choose a burrito, bowl, salad or 3 tacos and take it from there. On this visit, I chose the bowl, topped with step 2, kalua pig for $6.95 and doubled with huli huli chicken for an extra $2.00. Step 3, I chose seaweed rice (brown rice with nori) and black beans, step 4 I went with the mango and corn salsa, as well as the guacamole for an extra $1.65. My last step, step 5, I chose toppings like cabbage, cilantro and a'a lava chips. As you can see, you're literally building a plate from the ground up. Lots to choose from and the food was awesome. The kalua pig was super smokey and really juicy! The chicken was flavored well and really tender. All toppings and elements brought that Latin flare and a refreshing component. The cabbage and chips helped to represent a crunchy texture. Truly a great dish! For dessert I had to get the small coconut bark for $3.95. It was 1/4 of a pound goodness! Chocolate, caramel, cookie and coconut layered to make a sweet delight. Great way to end this wonderful meal! \n\nSeeing the great deals they offer on Groupon AND Yelp, makes me wonder. Usually Groupon deals to me, means the place is trying to attract more customers. The food they offer, in my opinion, does not need all that hype. When you serve great food at affordable prices, people will just come. This place serves pretty amazing food if I say so myself :-) I live on the opposite side of the valley and after trying this place out, I'm definitely coming back again soon, no matter the distance.

A symphony of sweet, salty and a flavor explosion of tender meat. Lets just say it's teriyaki steak's prettier cousin. The huli huli chicken was great as well - moist, perfectly seasoned with a tasty charred flavor. The Kalua pork was fork tender, moist and juicy (but just not my thing). But man oh man, the steak is definitely the winner. I'll just have all steak please!\n\nSo, you can count on me to talk about all of the unique sauces they had to offer...What can I say? I'm a sauce whore. Make sure to try all of their bottled sauces! Our favorite was the pineapple lime and jalape\u00f1o - it has an addicting, sweet, tropical flavor that pairs perfectly with the chicken and steak! We doused the crap out of our tacos and bowl with it. So good! They also have the coconut colada pearl which had a very light creamy coconut flavor, and the kind of heat that mildly hits you towards the back of your throat. It's not too spicy at all in our opinion, but it was also not our favorite.

Salsa just ok.\n\nFor entrees we ordered a chicken salad, steak pablano pepper and pork tacos.  All delish!  The chicken salad was full of flavor.  The steak pablano pepper (not sure if that was what it was called) was great.  The pepper stuffed with cheese, shrimp, onions and mushrooms sandwiched by a thin steak.  Wow.  Really wow.  Yum.  The tacos were good and flavorfull too.  My daughter ordered the corn dog (haha-kids) which they served honey mustard with which I thought was weird. lol  \n\nThe decor was very blah.

Although they give you big portions, in this case, it isn't a good thing (2), service - stinks worse than the food (0) value: edible food but nothing spectacular, shoddy service makes this place a (2).\n\nWe came here to try their happy hour because we were enticed by their rather extensive half priced bar menu.\n\nNormally when it comes to happy hours, we make it a point to sit at the bar because the bartender is right there offering you service. At this joint, the bartenders couldn't give a s&*t.\n\nHe barely acknowledged us as we sat down. After spending a good amount of time fetching 2 glasses of water (he was too busy flirting with 2 skanky looking chicks at the end of bar), he neglected to provide a menu. I had to sneak one away from our neighbour. \n\nBy the time he returned, we barraged him with our menu selections because we didn't know when he'd come back from infinity and beyond. Then he asked us \"are you sure you don't want a margarita?\". \n\nPet peeve rant. If I wanted a f&*king margarita I'd have ordered one. End of rant.\n\nRealizing we weren't going to order booze, he pretty much ignored us. We had to ask for everything -- from more refills of water even when our empty glasses were in front of his face to f*&king cutlery. Don't even get me started on him lifting out heavy bins of dirty dishes and not washing his hands. Oh, and it took at least 10 minutes to find him to print out our check.\n\nAt one point, the bar was completely unmanned for at least 6 minutes. A bunch of servers were huddled around the drink order area, waiting for their drinks to be made. Yup, the bar area = major clusterf$&k. And lets face it... the restaurant was perhaps 25% capacity (maybe 40 customers) and that's being freaking generous.\n\nThe bartender actually had the gall to say just as he handed us our check which he finally got around to printing out. \"Sorry about the poor service tonight. We just got slammed.\" By whom, I wonder, because the joint wasn't even hopping. \n\nIn a way that was totally a dick move to try and garner sympathy. He knew that service was shoddy but didn't really acknowledge it until he realized that he was going to get a s*&tty tip. Sorry douche -- you still got a shitty tip anyway. He's lucky we left anything at all.\n\nOn to the food.We ordered the fish tacos (3 tacos, $13 regular price), the tacos al pastor ((3 tacos, $11 regular price), the steak flatbread (2 large portions, $11 regular price)  and the ahi tuna tacos (3 tacos, $9 regular price). Portion sizing in general for their bar menu is rather generous. However given the lower quality of their food, large amounts is not a boon at all.\n\nWe sampled their chips and salsa. Our server just plopped them on our table so I had no idea of what kind of salsa it was. The warm one is better than the cold one but neither one was truly worth mentioning. Their chips are on the thinner variety and needed some salt.\n\nAhi tuna tacos were pretty bad. The fish had a weird sweetness to it that was singularily unpleasant. Encased in a taco shell made soggy by the watery, flavourless, green slime masquerading as guacamole, I believe this was definitely the worst dish of the night.\n\nThe fish tacos had a very skimpy portion of fish in it. Or maybe because there are too many freaking slices of red raw onion to actually identify that there's some underseasoned fish hiding in there. Texturally uninteresting, it definitely needed more cabbage to add some crunch. It was just terribly bland and not very interesting dish.\n\nTacos al pastor are not legit. It looks like chunky, stewed upchuck instead of the roasted pork on a spit. If that wasn't bad enough, the pork was as desperately flavourless as the fish tacos. Mixing in the grilled pineapple wasn't going to save it. It was pretty mediocre.\n\nThe flatbread de bistek was the only thing that was truly palatable that night. The steak actually was seasoned and the flatbread was crisp - almost like a thicker cracker. It definitely wasn't anything astounding but at least it was okay. But as finger food, it's really messy to eat without a knife and fork. \n\nOverall, given the s*(tty service and the \"okay to the-verge-of-nasty\" food, I have no inclination to return. I was seriously debating about given this place a 1 star review. However the food was bad but wasn't completely inedible.

It's a mid-upscale, Mexican restaurant with a plush, modern decor and very inviting, comfortable ambience. Its Happy Hour offer is excellent with good bar dishes and drinks and low prices. Service at the bar is quite SUBPAR, however.\n\nMy HH EXPERIENCE: \n- My first HH experience here was good enough that I'd go back there again and soon, and bring some friends along. \n\nIts entrance looks upscale and inviting, with the large open patio on the side, its lit firepit radiating warmth and charm. Inside the entrance is a nice waiting area. I was surprised to see a modern, mid-upscale decor - nothing resembles a traditional Mexican establishment! \n- It was only after I saw the HH menu and well after getting my free tortilla chips, when Cantina Laredo made me feel being in a Mexican restaurant. \n- I took a seat at the bar counter, which was about half-full around 6pm, and had to wait unusually long to get my 1st beer and chips! After one of the 2 barkeeps first greeted me, then they just seemed to ignore the customers.\n\nThe bar lounge is medium sized with an attractive bar counter and  several nice bar tables. Its happy hour (4-7; 9-closing M-F: Sat 11-5pm) offers a good selection of drinks ($2-5, plus daily drink specials), half-off bar dishes ($5-7), with free, warm tortilla chips!\n[- See pics of menu]\n\nI enjoyed my draft Dos XX ($3) and a delicious Margarita (Monday Special, $5, equivalent to two normal margaritas at $3each). For food, I had its popular Crab Cakes ($5.5) which came with 3 pieces - great price. However, the first cake I tasted was disappointing, a bit loose, runny, hardly had any crab meat, and was ONLY LUKE WARM (despite the warning from the server that the plate was super HOT!). After several attempts, I finally got the attention of the bartender, who called the manager. The manager was very friendly and offered to get me another order. I asked him to just have it warmed up, which he did. After the dish was warmed up, the crab cakes did taste much better; those remaining two did contain some crab meat! The mgr explained that the batch was probably not mixed well enough for more even distribution of ingredients? The gentleman sitting next to me was going to order the crab cakes but changed his mind after seeing my order.\n\nActually my main disappointment was its two bartenders' SUBPAR service that evening. They were NOT attentive, even the bar was not busy. They avoided eye contact with customers. The gentleman next to me and I were sitting at a great spot near the beer tabs and cash register, but we both still had great difficulty getting their attention even for our 1st drink, not to mention our subsquent orders...!\n\nNote to Management:\n- I understand that your nice restaurant is still brand new. I do hope your management would conduct more training to improve (1) the services at the bar counter, and (2) the consistency/quality of its dishes. PLEASE!\n\nIN SHORT: \n- For its elgant, modern decor, nice ambience, and especially its good happy hour menu and low price, I like Cantina Laredo's HH, and will go back. Hopefully, its service at the bar will get better. When it does, I'll include it in my list of favorite bars.\n\nPeterskis, Dec 2012\n--", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 4, "cool": 4}}, {"text": "The food was OK.

Well, Tex-Mex.  And I'm thrilled that it's close by in Tivoli Village.\n\nWe were here first for a milestone birthday party.  The drinks - Margaritas and Sangria - flowed constantly from pitchers served by the wait staff.  Knowing it was going to be a long night, I gave up the Margarita after downing the first half because it was really strong - and really good! - and I'm the self-designated driver half of our family.  The Sangria was great, too, but a little less potent.\n\nWhile the food may have not been totally representative of a regular dinner at Laredo, since it was served buffet-style, it was delicious.  There was excellent guacamole on the tables (regularly made table-side to order), and the hot food was changed up a few times during the evening, so I sampled quite a few of their items.  I was impressed by just about everything.\n\nThe room the party was held in was in the back of the restaurant and not fully closed-off.  I've been to dinners held at some other restaurants in the area that are in back rooms completely separated from the main space (Roy's, Gordon Biersch), and I might have been in Peoria, since the decor and charm of the restaurant was nonexistent.  At Cantina Laredo, I felt as if we really were in the restaurant.\n\nService was exceptional.  The waiters assigned to the party were efficient beyond belief, constantly removing plates, refilling drinks, and were also very friendly.\n\nThe good service continued when I returned a couple of nights ago with some friends to sample Happy Hour, which runs till 7 p.m.  \n\nWe shared a Queso Fundido, a melted cheese platter with chorizo sausage, and it was as good as any I've had in Mexico.  Two friends ordered taco platters, which were three small tacos piled high with fillings.  Along with the drinks and the Queso Fundido appetizer, it made for a woman-sized meal at a very reasonable price.  I ordered the crab cakes because the waitress said they were sauteed rather than fried.  The taste was good, with just a little kick (could have used a bit more), but the texture was totally mush.  I doubt whether I'd order them again.  \n\nMy CasaRita, for $5 ($1 extra for the cranberry flavoring), was stronger than I expected at Happy Hour prices, but since I was having only the one drink, it was good.  Very good.  There was a glitch with the two glasses of wine my friend ordered.  Before ordering, she asked the waitress what red wines were included in the $4 HH price, and was told that it was the wines listed for $7.50 on the regular menu.  But when the bill came, her two glasses were $15.  Seems that THAT wine wasn't included, a little fact the waitress neglected to mention.  But the manager adjusted the price, and I hope he offered the waitress a tutorial on HH wine prices.\n\nThe atmosphere is modern, with very little to suggest an ethnic restaurant, but I love all the stone and other decor.

That excitement quickly turned into dismay as we experienced the shitty service and crappy food. When we do happy hour, although we prefer sitting at a table, oftentimes we sit at the bar counter if we are concerned about slow service by the waitstaff. Typically, the bartenders do a much better job refilling your water and attending to you than the regular waitstaff. Unfortunately, this was the exception to that rule. Frankly, this was probably some of the worst service we've ever had sitting at the bar. We are very understanding if the bar/restaurant is busy, but this wasn't one of those cases. The bartender asked if we were interested in the happy hour menu and what we wanted to drink. We replied yes and we would start with ice water until we had a chance to peruse the menu. He acknowledged us but then proceeded to take care of other bar customers for the next several minutes before eventually serving us ice water. We got impatient waiting for him to give us a menu so we grabbed a menu that had been placed aside by one of the other customers sitting a few seats away.\n\nWe decided to order the Mahi Mahi fish tacos ($13), pork al pastor tacos ($11), ahi tuna tacos ($9) and steak flatbread ($11) and save room for the mango tres leches for dessert. The tacos came in orders of 3. Everything was half-price for happy hour, except for desserts. We were served a complimentary basket of tortilla chips and 2 kinds of salsa, mild and spicy. The chips were unusually thin and the salsas unremarkable. Our order came out pretty quickly, about 10-15 minutes after we ordered. The flatbread was huge. It was not bad but not great and also the best dish by far. The pork al pastor was a distant second and quite disappointing. Instead of pieces of pork sliced off a rotating spit, it consisted of ground pork marinated with Mexican spices but severely lacking in salt. The Mahi Mahi tacos were bland and very skimpy on the fish and drowning in a raw red onion \"salsa\" which completely drowned out other flavors. The ahi tuna tacos were our least favorite. They were unusually sweet and soggy due to the extremely watery and bland guacamole underneath. On our way to the restroom, we spotted their dessert display tray sitting on a random counter. We were hoping that perhaps dessert would bring some minor redemption, but the mango tres leches did not look legit so we decided to pass.\n\nNow, let's continue talking about the service. After telling our bartender that we only wanted to drink water, he asked if we were sure we didn't want a margarita. I find this second-guessing and upselling tactic incredibly annoying. If I wanted to order an alcoholic drink, then I would've ordered one. To add insult to injury, we had to attempt to get his attention and wave him down numerous times for everything from water refills, getting the check, and even for eating utensils, believe it or not! At least a couple of times, our water glasses were completely empty and ignored even though he was standing directly in front of us after he finished entering orders into the register. Once we finally got our check the bartender actually had the gall to say \"Sorry about the poor service tonight. We just got slammed. I hope you understand.\" Oh, really? Maybe, we're both blind because it certainly didn't appear busy at all. In fact, the place was mostly empty. Listen if you're going to own up to poor service, then don't try to justify it with some BS excuse. Hey Luis, understand this: you are lucky that we still tipped you 10% on the happy hour pricing instead of a big fat goose egg. We usually tip 15% on the regular non-discounted pricing, but this guy didn't even deserve what we gave him.\n\nIn summary, inauthentic Mexican food that is gross to subpar even by Americanized standards combined with abysmal service gets Cantina Laredo 1.5 stars. Since my wife rounded up to 2 stars, I'm rounding down to 1. Frankly, we were shocked by how pathetic both the food and service were.

Try taking the tortilla chips and dipping it into that.  It's total bomb diggity :)  Our table also got a few chicken and pork tacos, as well as chicken fajitas nachos al carbon for $10.  It was a full plate of the chicken, melted cheese peppers and goodness!  The chicken tacos or Taco De Pollo for $9.45 was Fajita chicken with avocado, pico de gallo, queso fresco and poblano drizzle.  It was packed with a lot of flavor!  Avocado is creamy and chunky and the pico de gallo offers a light taste with fresh ingredients.  The Tacos De Carnitas for $10.05 includes Slow-roasted pork with chipotle wine sauce.

Our order was hastily dropped off by another server/food runner. It wasn't bad and was a large enough portion to feed four. Tuna tacos were ok, but surprisingly bland, minus the guac and red onions. The casarita margarita tasted watered down and wasn't nearly as strong as it should have been. My wife's salad suffered from mushy mangos and soggy greens.

Unfortunately, these tacos made me crave one found at much cheaper taquerias (Tacos el Gordo anyone?). The barbacoa was my favorite with it's smokey flavor. The carnitas wasn't any better than what I can make at home and the al pastor was average. They would have been good coming from a home cook, but from an upscale restaurant...

My husband got one of the enchiladas entrees.   The ceviche was decent and fresh, but probably a bit salty for most people...I liked it, especially paired with my glass of Brut.  The tuna in my tacos was unexpectedly sweet, but with a little salsa and habanero sauce (we requested)...it tasted really good.

I should have paid more attention to the reviews of my two friends on Yelp.  Live and learn.\n\nWe were here about 4:15 yesterday afternoon and there were very few people there.  We were seated immediately and brought menus and drinks.  The chips and salsas were brought and our server explained that the warm salsa was spicy and the cold salsa was not spicy.  The chips and spicy salsa were good.  The chips are very thin and I found I broke several in half dipping them in the salsa.\n\nFor our dinners, I ordered the Tacos al Pastor.  Here's the description from their menu:  Spicy pork with pineapple, pico de gallo and cilantro.  My wife ordered the Tampico which is described as: Grilled chicken breast topped with saut\u00e9ed artichoke hearts, mushrooms, spinach, red bell peppers with sour cream-poblano sauce and monterey jack cheese.\n\nMy tacos were just OK.  The biggest problem with them was there was only one taco.  When I get tacos like this at genuine Mexican places, they're always doubled so there's some body to help hold the filling.  With my tacos and the single shell, the pico was wet enough that it softened the taco and made it almost impossible to pick up to eat.  I did eat the first one that way but I was awash in juice.  The pork was OK, but the spice was a heavy coating on the pork.  It was spicy but other than that, there wasn't a whole lot to recommend the tacos.  I also thought of the al pastors I've gotten from street vendors on East Charleston for a fraction of the cost I paid.  Stupid me!  With my tacos came rice and black beans.  My wife liked her chicken and it was as described.  It's the kind of dish you might get at any Tex/Mex kind of restaurant.\n\nDessert was the star of the night.  I got the tr\u00e8s leches cake and she got the Mexican brownie.  My cake was excellent.  Her brownie came with a bit of table side ta da!\nThe brownie was placed on a very hot cast iron dish safely in a recessed wooden holder.  Then the vanilla ice cream was put on top of the brownie.  LAst, the sauce was poured over the ice cream and when the sauce hit the hot dish, it bubbled and made a kind of extra buttery syrup that added to the flavor of the brownie and ice cream.  \n\nNow to service:  Up until the time we got our meals, everything was going along fine.  Then our server disappeared.  She came back once and asked about the food and then was gone again.  10 minutes after we finished our dishes, she was nowhere to be found.  The host looked at us several times and it seemed as though he was going to get her at one point but that was not the case.  Finally she showed and we asked about a box and asked about dessert.  She said she'd get the dessert tray and be back.\n\nAgain she was just gone.  About 5 minutes later, another server stopped and asked if we wanted a box.  We told him we'd already asked for one and then he brought his tray down to show us the desserts. We made our choice with him.  A few minutes later, our server and this second person arrived with the desserts.  She stood by as he did the table ta da for the brownie.  Then she left again.  About 6 minutes later, she came back with the check and just put it down.  \n\nWhen I finished dessert and we had some time to relax and talk, I got my credit card out and put it in the holder and within 10 seconds, she was there to pick it up.  Wow, Speedy Gonzales then but not at the needed times.  \n\nI really like Tivoli Village and there are some other restaurants there that I have yet to try.  But, Cantina Laredo won't be one of them.

Anyway, the tableside guacamole was really good, the margaritas were good, and the enchiladas were tasty.

Upon entering you will see a bar area to the left, an outdoor area to the far left, and to the right more seating inside with the cool AC running. There is also more seating available on the patio, but we opted for the cool indoor seating. \n\nThen menu is simple, the front is the Entrees and food, the back has all the drinks they offer. This visit we all got a mojito, the waiter suggested adding peach to make it more delicious, and boy he was spot on with that! We chose the \"Cantina roll\" and the table side guacamole as our apps, they also provide you with chips and 2 different types of salsas. I liked both, one was a little spicier than the other so it was nice to have variety. Soon our lady came to us with her cart to make the table side guac, what I liked most is that you have a choice of peppers, the hot Serrano, spicy jalapeno, or the roasted jalapeno. I really wanted Serrano, but we went with the jalapeno. You can also choose what other ingredients you would like added, the standard tomatoes, red onions, cilantro, and of course lime and other spices. She pitted 2 large avocados and went to work making the guac. She was very good at making it, although I would've like it a little creamier, she had big chunks of avocado in there, luckily they were ripe and soft so it was ok. My friend liked it so much so he ordered a 2nd order when dinner arrived. \n\nFor our entrees we all ordered enchiladas, my \"mother\" opted for the enchiladas de espinaca aka spinach enchiladas. They consisted of Saut\u00e9ed spinach, Monterey jack cheese and mushrooms topped with sour cream poblano sauce. Her husband went with the Enchiladas Veracruz which were made of chicken, spinach and monterey jack topped with tomatillo sauce, marinated vegetables, and queso fresco. I went for the Enchiladas de Camarones aka shrimp enchiladas, these were made with Shrimp, Monterey jack cheese and roasted peppers on vegetables topped with sour cream poblano sauce. All entrees include 2 enchis and rice, some cilantro some Spanish, and black beans. My enchiladas were super amazing, and coming from a Mexican girl that should mean something! My friends also agreed! Their entrees were gone is less than 10 minutes! As well as their yummy mojitos! If you've ever dined with me, I am definitely the slowest eater ever, BEWARE!\n\nThe nice server came back to our table and asked if we were ready for dessert, of course Santiago said yes so he brought out an actual plated selection of what was available. We chose the mango tres leches and the Mexican brownie. The Brownie consisted of a large brownie with pecans and walnuts served on a sizzling skillet with Mexican Brandy Butter and vanilla or cinnamon ice cream. The mango tres leches were a creamy vanilla cake with fresh mango as well as mango cream sauce. THEY WERE AMAZING! My favorite was the mango tres leches, mainly bc it was sooooo light and tasted amazing with the mangos! By the end of all of this, we were totally full!\n\nThe service at Cantina Laredo is impeccable and the quality and quantity of food is just right for the price, its more gourmet and you can tell they put love and time into every dish they make.

I originally went to a Cantina Laredo in Dallas a few years ago and this is pretty much exactly the same (although a little fancier inside).\n\nThat being said it is a pretty legit restaurant- if you have tried to eat Mexican in Las Vegas you probably have seen its a desert wasteland of options. Cantina Laredo is a little pricier than most (about 20$ minimum per person) but is pretty good food and service wise.\n\nThere is both a self park lot and valet -the valet stand is right across the round about from Cantina Laredo. The lot is not very far away but after you get Mex-ecuted at a big meal the walk begins to look more like a death march- I highly recommend valet.\n\n\nThe Food- Like I said , its Tex-Mex so order accordingly (fajitas for instance) . Start the meal off with some cheese dip or Guac- both are very good - and its one of the few places I have found in Vegas where you can actually get queso DIP instead of queso fundido- an item that should only be served to particularly hard to crack Guantanamo detainees. The regular salsa they bring you with the chips is OK but nothing special. \n\nFajitas- this is a pretty big amount of food for one person- if you tend to eat a lot of chips or order an appetizer you can easily get by splitting this for two people. The steak comes in larger than usual fajita pieces which I like as it generally means the meat is less dried out/overcooked in the middle. The chicken- who knows cause I would never order chicken fajitas this is America.\n\nDrinks- most of the mixed drinks come a little too sweet for my tastes so I get some lime pieces and make sure and add some more lime juice.

It can be very flat tasting if too much tahini (sesame paste) is mixed in, or it may be over-spiced. This baba was beautiful, with all the tastes dancing in our mouths. Julliette makes her own bread to go with it. The texture is very different from pita (even the pita served here was selected with great care), crustier and chewy. A special of the day was stuffed cabbage. About the same size and shape as the stuffed grape leaves (which were delicious), these are lighter and lemony good - a real treat. We shared a combination kebab plate with chicken, kefta, and shish-kebab skewers. This paled in comparison to the other dishes, since the meat was on the dry side. The baklava was quite good, it wasn't soggy with syrup, so the layers of phyllo dough made a satisfyingly crunchy noise.\n\n    After lunch we did a little shopping.

Second, the food at the Olive Tree is as good as or better than all of the Mediterranean sitdown restaurants I have ever eaten. (I really don't know why the previous reviews were so harsh.  This food is good.)\nBecause we had to order $50 worth of food with our restaurant.com gift certificate from a deli, we ordered a lot of food.  Of the items that we tried, all were outstanding.  The Olive Tree used the best ingredients in all of the foods we ate.\nWe asked the woman in charge if we could have our Gyro and Philly Cheesesteak (okay it wasn't all Mediterranean) while we were waiting for the rest of our food to cook.  She immediately turned and asked the cook to make those two items first.  (The man and woman who were in charge were very friendly and professional.)\nWe sat at the tables and enjoyed our first two servings.  We knew right away that we were in for something special.\nAfter we got the rest of our food, we drove home and we ate our kebbi and spinach pie and I ate the gyro I ordered (we ordered two gyros).  Delicious.  The bread on the spinach pie was freshly baked and the ingredients in all of the items were fresh and perfectly balanced. (I have been to many Mediterranean delis looking for a great gyro only to be disappointed by a Sysco or similar style gyro.)  I don't know if the meat on this gyro were made in house but it was excellent.\nLater that night, we had the meat pie with sauce, fettouch salad, shish kabob and some pita bread with the jalepeno hummus.  Outstanding (even though the food had been reheated).  Unfortunately, the pita was stale by the time we got to it, but the flavors were there.  I just wish I had room in my stomach to eat  the pita while it was still fresh.\nWe still have more food to eat tomorrow and probably the next day.\nDo yourself a favor before going to the restaurant if you are going to use the restaurant.com GC.  Get some friends together, go to restaurant's website olivetreeaz.com and look at the menu.  Order ahead and get the food to go.  Get it home quickly and eat.  This is really great food and it needs to be eaten as soon as possible once it comes off the grill.\nIf you are taking a trip north to Flag or the Grand Canyon, make it a point to stop here and fill up before you start your journey.  It is only a mile or so off of 17 and it is worth the drive.\nThe Olive Tree is a deli and the food is at deli prices.  The food is an outstanding value.\nEat at the Olive Tree.  Your palate will thank you and your pocket book will thank you.\nPostscript:  The market has a huge selection of mediterranean foods and spices at very good prices.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "We love The Olive Tree!

This place was open, so we walked in. It was about 20 minutes before closing, and I'm pretty sure the family (seems like a \"family run joint\") was just about to break down the kitchen and pack it in. \n\nI ordered the gyros plate, Athena went with the kebabs. Beef, to be exact. Our dinners both came with soup or salad. If I recall, there were 3, maybe 4, types of salad and one soup to choose from. We both opted for Greek salads. The owner (I assume he was the owner) took our order and called it out to the cook. Athena conversed with him a bit, putting in an order for some baklava to go, when we left, while I strolled the cheese section of the market. \n\nThe owner asked if we would like our salads first, and we said yes. I sat down at one of the nine tables, while Athena perused an aisle or two. In addition to delivering our salads to the table, the owner retrieved silverware and napkins for us from the trays located by the drink machine that I was filling drinks at. The brewed ice tea container had already been drained, or was at least empty, and the owner offered to brew fresh for us! We politely declined the offer and opted for soft drinks. No reason to brew fresh for two people when you are trying to close, but so nice to offer!\n\nThe salads were ultra tasty, with a sprinkling of sheep's milk feta atop a crisp green salad with kalamatas, romas, cukes and plenty of sliced pepperoncini (I'm going to say they were Italian, not Greek ). The salads were perfectly dressed and ultra tasty. \n\nOur plates arrived, mine with thick fries cooked in peanut oil, hers with perfectly cooked Basmati rice and a nice yellow color to it. Her kebabs were already removed from the sticks, and all the veggies and steak were charred very nicely. The Tahini sauce was pretty decent.  My Gyros (traditional lamb/beef combo) were cooked very well, with ultra thin slices off the spit. Tzatziki sauce was nice and tangy, I'd guess made with Greek yogurt as opposed to regular yogurt or the sour cream others try to pass off! The fries were a bit on the soft side, but nicely cut and flavorful.\n\nAs we ate, the cashier closed down the market station and tidied up. The owner continued to stop by and make sure everything was good. It was! He was very friendly, and seemed genuinely concerned with our satisfaction. \n\nWe assured him we would be back to eat, and to do some shopping, as we had discussed the many types of oils available (you gotta try the avocado oil with lime - along with plenty of other oils available by the silverware). Since they were ready to close, we didn't think now would be the time to peruse the many varieties of dry/canned goods available, or the fresh cheeses. There was an aisle I didn't even go down, so that will be a surprise when we return, which we will.\n\nI give this place kudos, and I think it will fill a niche market for groceries to be sure. It should do well - even with 2 other delis in the plaza. Each seems to cater to a slightly different deli crowd.  Definitely check it out. \n\nSolid 4 stars on food freshness, and quality.

I asked the clerk what it was and she told me it was a certain kind of bean (not a string bean) that they get from the Asian Market on Main and Dobson.  I traveled to China in 1998 and remembered this vegetable in several dishes then.\n\nWill definitely go again!  Great place for a quick lunch!

Solid Ethiopian food and friendly folks.  Not the place to go if you're on limited time, but make it a destination with some friends and you'll love it.  \n\nIf you're new to Ethiopian food, it's served communally on injeera, a crepe-like bread made from teff grain (an addiction of mine, I have to admit).  The dishes, meat and/or vegetable, are thickly stewed and heaped on the injeera; you tear off a piece and use it to scoop up the food.  My friends asked for forks to help, but I just dug in--hope you will, too, as it's half the fun of the experience.  Portions are generous (we had three substantial servings plus four more from our leftovers of one meat and one vegetable dish).  I won't go into the individual dishes, you just can't go wrong here.\n\nAnd don't, by any means, skip the Ethiopian coffee service at the end of your meal.  Beans are roasted and ground on the spot (love the smell), then brewed over an open flame and poured into lovely demitasse cups.  Add some sugar, and . . . dessert!\n\nBTW, the New Times mini-review said the restaurant is \"in the back of a convenience store.\"  That info will help you figure out how to get into it (there's no \"front,\" just a door), but it doesn't do justice to the Ethiopian market out front, which covers everything Ethiopian from colorful headscarves to cooking pots.

My first comment/question has nothing to do with this restaurant, per se; but maybe someone can help me out:  I've been to four different Ethiopian restaurants in PHX so far and three of the four have clear, plastic tablecloths on the tables.  Is there something I'm missing?  Is my grandmother driving to Ethiopian restaurants and covering their tables with plastic?  If they had couches, would those be covered in plastic, too?\n\nElderly-grandmother decorating aside -- and in a hot place like PHX, plastic tablecloths can actually be an uncomfortable decoration to have -- it's true, as one reviewer wrote, that decoration is basic.  And ceiling fans would probably make a big difference to making the place feel a little less hot and claustrophobic, too.  I also read a few people's comments about it taking 45 minutes for the food to come out.  Perhaps because there were only a very few people when we arrived our food only took 15 minutes to come out, but I saw no sign of foot dragging here.\n\nWe had the combo meat and veggie platter, as we have at every Ethiopian restaurant we go to.  It's gotten to a point, where we've convinced ourselves, that true Ethiopian food only comes in mixed platters.  \n\nHow did this platter stack up?  Well, as far as it being good for two, as they claim on the menu, I would say, that unless you are very healthy eaters (\"healthy\" as in \"gluttonous\"), the claim is justified.  But you won't be bursting at the seams when you're done (and, here's a hint:  you're not supposed to when you eat in a healthy manner).  Still, if you DO like to eat, two people splitting this might not work.\n\nOne reviewer wrote, that for $11.99 for two people (the cost of the platter), you couldn't beat the price.  That's true.  However, to be fair, I should point out, that for $2.00 more, the same platter is much larger at Gojo, has more items, more bread and is much tastier.  That is NOT to say, that this platter is not worth every penny of the $11.99.  Let's just say, if you're REALLY hungry, you'll want to order this at Gojo and pay the extra $2.00.\n\nThe owners are quite friendly and always ready to give advice, converse and do Ethiopian food justice (though they're not Ethiopian ... ask them where they're from and let's see how geographically savvy you are!).\n\nWe decided, that this place is well worth the hype it gets.  We still like Gojo better for several reasons.  But if aliens dropped down from one of Saturn's moons and kidnapped the cook at Gojo, we would definitely pick this as an alternate place instead of slitting our wrists in despair.\n\nWell done.\n\nOH!  One VERY important postscript:  this place has a dinner buffet for a very reasonable price on Friday nights.  Considering the only evening buffets I've ever seen in the Valley at nights were Chinese  (most other places I've run into have buffets for lunch only), the buffet is probably a fantastic deal.

Even better is their cooking tools section (where you can buy huge tamale steamers, and mortar and pestles for making chile) and the catering menu which starts at $5 per person.  Holy crap.  What a steal.  \n\nUpon entrance you'll see the deep pit outside where some man is grilling all the carne you'll find served inside.  As you step inside you'll see some brisk business - I found all sorts of types and ethnicities here - a young couple on a date, some girls gabbing over lunch and others ordering food and pastries to go.\n\nThe food here ROCKS.   It's very authentic, cooked by commadres and tias just like back home.   The Grandma quotient on the beans and rice was very high -- always a standard assessment in my quest for good Mexican food.  They have every imaginable burrito type here and they're huge and cheap - at $4.  I always opt for the veggie (rice, beans, cheese and guacamole) burrito and am always impressed - the best part being the freshly made tortillas.  I even bought some on my way out to take home.\n\nThe tacos are a good choice too.  The combo plates start at $5.  The carne asada (a little overcooked) was pretty good and delicious in a flavorful marinade, and the shrimp taco was really good - a much better choice I would add.  Paired with some tamarind, strawberry agua fresca or horchata and you'll be in heaven.\n\nI find the bakery to be the highlight regarding the food.  The pandulce was excellent - if a bit more fresh (than Ranch Market) given the way it's stored behind a glass case rather than self-service.  The conchas and pineapple empanadas were soft, sweet and delicious - with perfect texture.

That's the feeling I had yesterday afternoon when I foolishly decided to try La Tolteca for the first time...\n\nWhy was this a foolish decision? Because I got sick. Super duper sick. Which I should have known was going to happen because the Fish Burro I ordered tasted terrible. And now, here I am, 24 hours later, still trying to keep fluids in my body in between trips to the bathroom.\n\nNow I know what you're thinking... \"What does he expect? He ordered a Fish Burro!\" And I know. You're right. It's just that I've had such good luck with fish tacos at a couple of other restaurants lately (Canteen, Tacos Atoyac) that I decided to see what sort of magic La Tolteca could create with their mahi mahi. Apparently their in-house magician has Mondays off.\n\nI seriously don't know why there's so many four and five star reviews of this place on Yelp. It's not that great. Even if my burrito hadn't made me ill, I still would have felt compelled to write something to balance all the positive reviews on here. Maybe the corn tortillas they use on their tacos deserve the accolades that other reviewers can't seem to stop talk about, but my flour tortilla was below average. It was dry and it tasted like paper.\n\nAs for the burro, I specifically asked about the filling prior to ordering it and I was told that it only contained cabbage, fresco cheese and guacamole. Sadly, when I took my first bite, out spewed a white, mayonnaise-like substance. The burro's filling was more like a fish salad of sorts and it tasted off. Very off. And the fish wasn't hot. Actually, nothing it the burro was the least bit warm. And the guacamole was on the side--not inside the burro. But again, I was starving at this point so I took it down. Every last bite.\n\nI knew immediately that something was wrong. I considered removing the food from my body as soon as I got outside, but I decided to keep my finger out of mouth and let things settle. Big mistake. There would be no settling. I consider myself to have an iron gut, too. I can basically eat anything in any quantity (not that I do this often) but normally I have good luck. I haven't been this sick since eating food from a middle-of-nowhere farmstand while bike touring in the Caribbean.\n\nI'm giving La Tolteca two stars because I did like their hot sauces--all of them. And they have cheap beer, too ($2 Coronas all day, every day). However, as Michael S. noted in an earlier review, everything I tried tasted off. Tangy is fine when that's what a place is going for, but everything I ate tasted slightly tangy in a ugh-this-is-going-to-make-me-sick sort of way. Not cool.\n\nSo that's that. I really don't think I'll be back. I have no desire to explore the bakery case and there's way too many small taquerias around to take any more chances with this high-volume, supermarket of a restaurant.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I love La Tolteca the variety of truly authentic Mexican fare.  \n\nMy Mom was in town from Alaska and craving some good Mexican food so I took here to La Tolteca to get her fix.

I have brought several people here who doubted my claim of \"best in Phoenix\" and they all left agreeing with me.\n\nI confess that I tend to stick to a few favorites and always over-order, but it's all so tasty!  Their super nachos are much more \"super\" if you put carne asada on them instead of the standard ground beef.  I had never had elotes con todos (corn with everything) before coming here, but somehow, steamed corn on a stick with mayo, chili powder and cheese is a winning combination. Who knew?  There is no way to eat this corn daintily but it's so good that I don't care.  I can floss later.\n\nThe carne asada or carnitas soft tacos are consistently high quality but the real reason I pilgrimage here from clear across town is the fish tacos.  The mahi mahi is perfectly seasoned and flaky, with homemade tartar sauce and queso fresco.  I personally skip the rice and beans because they do use lard in the beans and that doesn't always sit well with me.  The salsa verde from the always well stocked salsa bar is noteworthy and good on nearly everything and just a few drops of habanero salsa on my fish taco is enough for great flavor and a little kick without totally setting my insides on fire. If you like ceviche, try the tostada de ceviche - a great little value for the price - shrimp, avocado, onion, tomato and lime for under $3?  I couldn't make it for that cheap!\n\nThe latest development at La Tolteca is the construction of an outdoor BBQ grill just outside the entrance closest to the parking lot. Perhaps this will reduce smokiness inside from the somewhat poorly ventilated indoor grill.  That would be great.\n\nBefore you leave, be sure to pick up some churros and a fruit empanada or two, or even some arroz con leche (rice pudding) at the panaderia (bakery).

Gahhhhhhhhhhhhh...\" This place is amazing. \n\nOne of the most appealing things to me about La Tolteca was its no-nonsense approach to everything. Food is ordered from a board menu above a counter and prepared in a small kitchen area in front of you. Slightly further back lies the grocery store component which does have an interesting (Maybe typical for Phoenix, but what do I know?) variety of Mexican groceries and specialties to recommend it.

There is a place in Tucson, but it's relatively expensive and inconvenient for me, so I don't go there much. When I walked in, there was a woman in the back who just looked at me and, without standing up, asked me what I wanted. Before I even saw the pierogis on the menu, I looked at what she was doing, and realized that she was rolling some fresh ones. YUM!\nI've been to a lot of Polish delis and they usually let you get a half dozen. Here, I had to get a dozen, and there are different pricing levels (usually $1) for cooked versus frozen pierogis. But, at about $8 for a meat-less dozen, they definitely run higher than what you would find back east, although you're also several thousand miles from most of those places.\nI ordered the cooked ones, since I intended on eating them soon, and was told that I would have to wait, so I got a New Times and took a seat. This was not the warmest service, but I also tend to expect that from Eastern European restaurants and delis (not a stereotype, just from experience).\nThe store doubles as a market. They sell Polish and Eastern European food products, in addition to sausages and other deli items. They'll also make sandwiches. It was relatively quiet and there were a couple of tables. It was a small place, but actually very comfortable to sit in, although this was still early (before 11am).\nAbout fifteen minutes later, a different woman (much more pleasant) emerged from the back and handed over a styrofoam box with a plastic fork sticking out of it.\nThe pierogis I got were cooked in bacon fat and had bacon on top. So, if you're a vegetarian, and were expecting no meat in the meatless pierogis, I guess you have to specify that to them beforehand. They were a bit more oniony and greasy than I would have liked, and lacked some of the more intricate and subtle flavors that I've gotten at other places. But these were definitely real-deal pierogis and that, alone, I really liked.\nI'll definitely be back. I can never get enough Polish food, and I'd like to try their sandwiches and sausages.

Tucked away on a side street just outside of the heart of Downtown Phoenix, Baiz is one of those kinds of places that I just would have never stumbled across in my usual wanderings had I not been clued into its existence by my good friends over at CenPho.com.\n\nWith so much awesomeness crammed into such a small place, it's a little hard to decide where to start... Since it is the primary part of Baiz, I guess I'll start with the market... From the first second that I walked into the doors, I was washed over with a feeling that I've missed from my days of living in San Francisco where I would routinely go shopping in a variety of small and authentic ethnic markets. The shelves were fully-stocked with a huge variety of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean products: a multitude of tasty fruit preserves and jams, spices galore, tahini by the jar or bucket (and every size in-between) and even hot ajvar (a condiment that's held a special place in my heart ever since I discovered it in college).\n\nBut for me the real shining star of the market was the deli and baked goods section. With a glass case filled with an assortment of different kinds olives and cheeses (some of which I've never heard of before) that includes a variety of fresh feta cheeses, it was like love at first sight. But looking just left of the olives and cheeses made me even happier: stacks of fresh, daily-made pita, rows of baklava (honey-drizzled pastries), slabs of halawa (sesame candy), a bin of turkish delight (jellied fruit squares) and pans of mamoul (fruit-filled cookie bars) all seemed to be calling my name... Must... Resist... Temptation... Onto the restaurant.\n\nSo I know it's not exactly the most culinarily-complex dish to choose, but the epitome of good Middle Eastern fare for me is a falafel sandwich. And while it's not quite up to the level of my all-time favorite from Falafel Drive-In in San Jose, CA (pretty close, though), Baiz definitely makes the best falafel sandwich that I've tried so far in the Phoenix area (and I have tried a few). The falafels were flavorful with a great texture (crunchy on the outside yet tender on the inside) and served with lettuce, turnips, tomatoes and tahini inside a fresh pita (I like to add in some hot sauce as well)... A quick side note: you'll be hard-pressed to find a better deal for lunch in the Downtown Phoenix area ($3 for a wonderfully tasty and filling meal).\n\nAlthough I haven't yet had the opportunity to try too many of the other dishes that the restaurant has to offer (dolmades, hummus, savory pies, etc.) due to the fact that I'm usually too full after the sandwich, I have tried the baba ghannouj, spinach pie and cheese pie. The baba ghannouj has a wonderful smokey flavor and great taste without being overly-infused with garlic. The \"small\" plate was definitely big enough for 2-3 people to share. The spinach and cheese pies were also great. Made fresh there at the restaurant, all their savory pies are handmade.\n\nSo if you're ever in need of some tasty Middle Eastern/Mediterranean  ingredients or feel like chomping down on an awesome falafel sandwich, check out Baiz in Phoenix.

The owner is persian, so you can tell where the tastes are coming from. Its somewhat hidden in the heart of Phoenix, but that's ok, once you are there you will be glad you found it.\n\nThis place is unique because they make their own bread! Are you kidding me? I only recently found out about this place like 3 years ago, and I've been living in Phoenix for 20 years. The chicken and beef shawarma have a special, authentic taste because of the fresh bread. One of the best parts about the shawarma is not only its amazing taste, but the pricing is very fair as well. I don't think I can stress this enough, but the fresh bread just sets this place apart from all the impostors in the Phoenix metro area. Why haven't the other restaurants caught on? I know of maybe one persian restaurant that makes their own bread, but their pricing makes them a different story (I'm talking about 'The Persian Room' in Scottsdale).\n\nI just don't understand how other restaurants can serve the bread that comes in plastic bags from a manufacturer hundreds of miles away. 'Good bread' and 'Arabic bread' are all good forms of pita that have great shelf life due to the ridiculous amounts of preservatives, but they just don't taste fresh.\n\nIf you like the bread, head to the back of the store and there is a shelf of freshly baked pita bread, its baked throughout the day, I think. I can tell because sometimes my bread is still warm and the bag has a little condensation. Beware though, the bread gets hard and crunchy after a few days, so you really need to use it quickly. This isn't bad, its just I think they choose not to add preservatives to ensure the freshness of the pita.\n\nI usually just get the chicken or beef shawarma, but I decided I'd get a kabob plate one day because I also wanted hummus. The beef kabob plate came with hummus, bread, 2 skewers of beef kabob, and some pickles and onions. Wow. The beef kabobs were cooked perfectly, and were EXTREMELY tender. It was a tad bit on the lemony side, but I suppose that was necessary to make it so tender. Perhaps some of the best 'persian kabobs' I have ever had. The hummus was definitely good as well, I can't stand restaurants that crack open a can of premade hummus. This restaurant certainly did not disappoint with the hummus.\n\nI know friends in Tucson that make stops specifically at this place for shawarma, and rightly so.

Well after visiting, it's pretty easy. I thought I would just cruise in to check it out and actually got a free bottle of crushed basil olive oil! It is by far the best tasting basil olive oil I've ever had and I've recently been putting it on anything.\nBut I digress. The employees here are really helpful and let you taste test a lot! \nI would suggest checking this place out when they do free events. I want to say they used to be on Wednesday evenings? You get to try different products paired with foods and wine. All sample size obviously, but still a great opportunity. \nThey don't have just cooking products either, their lavender body line is freaking amazing. I feel more relaxed just thinking about it.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 2, "cool": 3}}], "state": "AZ", "stars": 5.0, "latitude": 33.6228883}]}}
