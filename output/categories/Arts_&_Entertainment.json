For example, a few months ago I was standing in a Village outside of London...they were a very touchy lot of blokes.  Defecating on a hand drawn picture of the Queen engaging in intercourse with Justin Bieber and a two headed donkey...that looked strangely like Lady Gaga...okay...not that strange...she looks like a donkey...suddenly I am fighting off a bunch of bad teethed soccer hooligans. I knocked a few out and ran away cursing them that their children become the spitting image of Amy Winehouse.  No way to treat a former lover of Kate Middleton.\n  \nA few weeks ago I was standing in a little village near Burlington Vermont. ..the villagers...a very touchy group of former hippies who now drive gas guzzling SUV's.  A hand drawn picture of Bernie Sanders and Patrick Leahy taking turns performing fellatio to a two headed donkey...that looked strangely like Lady Gaga...okay...not that strange...she looks like a donkey. I was in trouble...I thought fast...Rex...a quick thinker if there ever was one...suddenly screamed...OH MY GOD FREE PHISH TICKETS!  The crowd ran the way I pointed.  I laughed. Dumb hippies. Hippies are dumber than cops and truck drivers...really think about that.\n\nSo when it was mentioned that I should go to the Village Pub and Casino I was filled with anger. Sense memory anger. My brain filled with disturbing imagery...English haberdasher with 2 front teeth...a stinky hippie with a \"Jerry Garcia is my father\" t-shirt both screaming and gnashing their brown chicklet teeth.  I resisted. I rebuffed their suggestion angrily. \"I am not afraid of you genetic freaks!\" My friend looked strangely at me while I shook my hand in the air and kicked a hippie that was not there. (I rhymed that sentence for you One Eyed Brenda...only because you let me do things to that socket no man should do.) \n \nEventually the Thorazene and gas fumes brought me back to my happy place...a island of fat chicks in bra tops and short shorts carry hot women on platters above their heads and the hot women are carrying beers and food above their head. Ah...my happy place.  I relented. I released the loathing. I went to the Village Pub.  Despite the 3 hours of sobbing and thrashing around the parking lot...I enjoyed myself immensely.  The inside looks like an old school Vegas dining room. Read fake leather round booths. Nautical pictures on the walls.  Kind of the place my dear sweet Aunt Gary Cooper Martinez took me to as a child.\n  \nThere are a few stand outs on the menu.  First and foremost...the burgers. Rex loves a good burger. Lots of good burgers, good toppings. The meat is tremendous and it is actually flame broiled. It tastes amazing. Pefectly cooked everytime. I would say that I do have one problem. The Southwest burger has jalapenos on it. Sometimes they are raw. Sometimes they are cooked. They are better cooked. It is 50/50. Rex doesn't like 50/50...unless you are talking about the mix between gas and ammonia he huffs. Rex is an animal. You can get a second patty for 2 bucks more. That is good stuff.\n \nThe broiled chicken is excellent and has a great garlic herb topping.  Excellent.  The steaks are very good and they always have a steak special.  The Prime Rib deal on Saturday packs the house and is a hell of a deal for 10 bucks!  The fish and chips are heavily advertised as a specialty...and honestly...they are good. Not exceptional, but very good. Worth a shot. The fries are thick cut, ask for them to be crispy...if not...a little limp...like you wish Rex was.\n \nVillage Pub is an EXCELLENT lunch spot.  Dinner, not so great. The dinner meals were not nearly as good. Pasta was okay, the fish was over cooked. Small things.  \n\nOne major plus...the bar is separated from the dining area and they are completely separated by a glass wall. No smoke. No screams from the drunks. No need to hear a grown man cry as he realizes he lost all of his money and was forced to spend 3 nights on the street until his check from getting a bag of Fritos with a mouse head in it...it was cold that night.

That alone warrants an extra star. Sometimes, especially in a place like Las Vegas, we take places like Barley's and the Station Casinos for granted because there are so many of them catering to the people that visit their establishments every other weekend. Since I've come from many places that don't favor the locals like this, I enjoy Barley's and the atmosphere. \n\nNow, I can only comment on a couple parts of this casino. First, the bar. I love the bartenders that work until around 1:00-2:00PM; they are very nice, always have a smile, actually act like they enjoy their jobs and maybe even, GASP, LIKE their jobs! When we go in there they recognize us, and almost always we have a Blue Diamond beer and Jameson straight up waiting for us as we get out our players cards. I've ordered food at the bar and they always get it right, and it is some of the best service I've had at a bar. I like coming here, and if you sit at the right place at the bar you won't be blinded by the cluttered casino floor filled to the brim with slot machines.\n\nThe other night we went to the Brewers Cafe. I didn't have high expectations of going to this restaurant because come on, a restaurant with a grilled salmon filet and side dish for $13? This can't be good. WRONG. I forgot that Vegas is nice on a budget if you don't become Drunky McGee and lose your life savings at the craps tables. First, the service. I am terrible at remembering names, but this woman was wonderful. Friendly to all of her tables (which is not easy to do at times), and she made me feel comfortable about eating my food (I am gluten free). She didn't push any item in particular to us to increase her sales, quickly mentioned the salad bar and didn't push dessert. Loved it. Nice and easy, in and out, good times.\n\nNow the food. My biggest pet peeve about restaurants is when you order a meat medium rare or, for those who like to eat shoe leather, well done, and when it comes it is the opposite of your order. Seriously, eating well done meat hurts me from top to bottom, and not in the happy way. Moving forward. My fiance ordered the NY Strip medium rare and when he cut it open IT STILL MOOED!!! It was PERFECTLY cooked and lightly seasoned with all that is really necessary for a good piece of meat, salt and pepper. No steak sauce necessary (don't even get me started about steak sauce). They have two kinds of fries, skinny fries and steak fries that have a house seasoning. What? Two kinds of fries at a small casino restaurant? That's right, I take joy in the smaller things in life. He got the skinny fries and was not disappointed.\n\nI ordered the above mentioned grilled salmon. I liked that they didn't dredge it in flour before grilling it, mostly because I am gluten free, but I also do not feel the salmon needs to be floured up to keep in the juices. Salmon is another dish that can easily be overcooked, dry and plain. At Brewer's Cafe? Perfect. They had enough lemon to squeeze onto the fish that could blind your eyes should you squeeze it in the wrong direction. LOVE. The salmon? Perfectly flaky, not overly seasoned or dripping in butter (I know, the rare moment when I don't want my food in a pool of butter), not lost in a flooding of sauce to mask the dryness, just perfect. Also, HUGE portion. HUGE. I could barely finish it, but most people know, if the food is good I will walk, shake and jiggle until I can fit it all in! The side vegetable, green beans, were standard, but also were not terrible. The baked potato? Massive and came with butter and sour cream. Sounds good to me! Let me put it this way, I had a dream about that salmon later that night. Maybe that was the vodka talking, but that salmon was great for only $13! It was no Joel Rubuchon, but hey, it's $13 and at a restaurant called Brewers Cafe in a CASINO called Barley's.\n\nAll in all, I think it's great.

Cold beer.\n\nNow and then after a 1 star day at work I visit Barley's to enjoy a cold microbrew draft beer and Caveman Keno. The atmosphere and beer elevates a 1 star day to at least 3 stars.\n\n  Barley's is an institution at Sunset and Mountain Vista that dates back to the late 90s. Barley's website alleges that it is the Valley's oldest and Henderson's only microbrewery. Barley's attraction is its microbrewery. It is a microbrewery that produces Black Mountain Beer, Boulder Gold Hefeweizen, Blue Diamond Beer, and Red Rock Original. For the record my favorite is the Blue Diamond Beer. The bartenders or mixotoligists serving the beer have been friendly, going so far as to introduce themselves. The upshot of this popular institution, is that the bar is often filled-to-capacity. \n\n  In similar fashion to several small businesses, Barley's sold out to a bigger company. Today Station Casinos owns Barley's. The Station preferred card is as good as gold in Barley's. Not only does Barley's gaming machines accept the Station preffered card, they also grant players a \"get out of paying for a drink pass\" when you put money in the machine. In my case, it works out. I put $5 in the Caveman Keno machine and when all is said and done, I break even because the $5 really paid for the open beer that is elevating a 1 star day to a 3 or above star day. \n\n  Gaming is fun in Barley's. This is not one of those bars that only offers video poker. This is a bar that features the gaming machines with a spectacular selection of Keno games. And these machines are not stiff. The last time I played at Barley's, Lady Luck struck and I won $100s. That is about the equivalent of 50 Happy Hour Barley drafts. So, sometimes Barley's has the power to elevate a 1 star day to a 5 star day.\n\n  Currently,  Barley's Happy Hour is Monday through Friday at the hours of 4 to 7. $2 drafts are the stars of Happy Hour. The Station Preferred card is the star of Barley's. If your gambling, the drinks are on the house.\n\n  Barley's is more than a casino, bar, and microbrewery. It is also a restaurant. In recent times I dined there once. To put it nicely their beer is better tasting and a better value than their BLT. A glance away from the restaurant is the brick oven pizza. Although I never tried it, the scent from the brick oven adds a nice scent over the bar.\n\n  When you visit Barley's you will come out a winner. That's unless you drink and drive. If the Red Rocks and Blue Diamonds are so good that you've had way too many, there are a few nearby sobering up opportunities. Nextstore is the Galaxy Theaters. Nearby are some decent restaurants including Olive Garden. There is a Smith's.

It's over 100 degrees, so it was hot waiting but there is a small bus shelter. Not bad.\n\nPool: basic, small, clean.  Clean towels provided poolside but no food, drinks, or dressing area.\n\nCasino: a few card tables, lots of  machines, a Keno runner circulating at least thru Denny's, a Keno machine area, several bars, a large Bingo hall.  I had an issue with my machine so lit the call button. The guy was there in about 10seconds to re-boot it. Very friendly.

Between 4:30 and 7:00 Monday through Friday I'll let my lovely little bunnies indulge in cheap drinks and offer a Power Hour game card for ten bucks that allows all the game play their little hearts desire for a whole hour! And maybe I'll even offer a reverse happy hour from 10:00 to close Sunday through Thursday... Yeah, that's a great idea, and I'll make my closing hours midnight Sunday through Thursday and one in the morning on Friday and Saturday! Now, meal deals, meal deals, how about an Eat and Play combo? It would consist of 25 meals and a ten dollar game card for $15.99, and I'd give them the option of adding an extra ten bucks to their game card for an even 25 bucks. Now I'd be a generous mayor, but I still have to pay for the infrastructure somehow, so I'd have to put a time limit on this awesome deal. Let's say Sunday through Thursday from open to close and until 5 in the evening on Friday and Saturday.\n\nAnd I'll sneak in a $2.00 activation fee for all new cards (except those with my mega meal deal), but to sweeten the blow I'll let my followers retain their cards to recharge them in the future, fee free!

Saturdays will be the most crowded, but will still be manageable in size, as the mob ebbs and flows between midway and video games.

Then they can trade those tickets in for junk like nose hair trimmers in the shape of a finger, t-shirts with our emblem on it, Chinese finger traps and jumbo pixie sticks!\n\nOoo, ooo, and there will be fun little shots in those bottom heavy hourglass-shaped shot glasses where the mixer goes in the bottom and the shot goes in the top.

You know, those crazy ones that moves back and forth and shout obnoxious things at you? Yeah, those. Eh, after a couple games, I'm bored. I don't want a moving target. I want a real shoot out competition. That's why I was glad to see real basketball goals, two of 'em, so I could have the shoot out I wanted to badly. That's where you'd find me, if I were to ever go back to D&B's. Forget the air hockey and motorcycle video games. Nevermind the boxing game that's surely rigged (I was totally ducking, a$$hole!). I'm camping out at the basketball game. To me, it's the only one that feels like a grown-up game. \n\nYeah, the trivia game is fun, but one round is, like, 5 questions. It takes me longer to tie my shoes. Sheesh. Rip off. Let down. Talk about a premature... Ok, so maybe I'm going overboard. \n\nBack to the games. With air hockey, trivia, boxing and both b-ball games played, what was left? I went on a hunt to find the martial arts game, cuz, let's face it, I love that game. I love pretending to kick the livin' $hit out of somebody. Well, I couldn't find it. Talk about the rest of the air deflating from my wanna-be balloon. \n\nSo, the real question is this: Did I have fun? Yes, I did. I admit it, but I spent a great portion of my time wandering around, hoping and wishing for more adult games, like virtual reality and the kind you'd find in a \"Must Be This Cool to Play\" arcade. I wanted to throw real punches and kicks.

I've had McDonald's chicken strips that were equally good but McDonalds doesn't have the gaming area that Dave and Busters has, or alcoholic beverages either. So after kickin a few back we decided it was time to play a few games. Of course, as a bunch of young guys, we turned everything into a competition. We shot some hoops, which i dominated, and played the football game too. I wasn't so good at the football game. Who knew throwing a football into a small circle would be so difficult, may have had something to do with the excessive drinking beforehand or so id like to think. They have a variety of fun games to play which is made more fun by the consumption of alcohol.

This is a place for partner dancing. Music is done by a DJ and as you might guess is almost entirely Latin.\n \nThe crowd was large and at times the floor was very crowded. Ability ranged from total beginner to advanced. \n\nThere were all ages but most tended to be in the 20-30 age range.

If I wanted to play games for coin, I'd go to an actual casino. They had some games that were free (limited time, I'm sure) and a few of the classics but overall, the choices are rather limited. \n\nAfter a bit of game, we decided to eat here as well. Got The Boss Chicken Club ( grilled chicken breast, applewood smoked bacon, creamy garlic-herb cheese, lettuce, tomato, avocado/mayo spread and fried onions on a toasted whole-wheat bun) with fries which was really good.

Oh sure, I had an affair or two, Tron, Donkey Kong, the games with lots of pretty colors and such.  Nothing quite matches the magic of those days for me.

Or Let's Go Jungle, a dose of safari madness where you and a friend can hop into your utility vehicle and unload on mutant frogs, leeches and lots of other unpleasant things.  The 50\" screen, 5.1 surround sound and kick back motors on the guns  help with the fun factor.\n\nSo when you get tired of listening to your best friend's girlfriend murdering another REM song on rock band while you hammer out a beat on your flimsy toy drum controller, when you've played with your wii so much that you can't lift the controller anymore, come down to Gameworks and try out some of the new developments in stand alone games.

Gameworks opened in 1997. I was actually part of the opening crew. I only worked there about 6 months but I loved it so much I would make it my weekly haunt for several years.  At that time Gameworks kept up with the gaming market which of course has gone down severely since console and computer gaming has become more popular. However, Gameworks was never a game room or an arcade. For the first year that it was opened you could have money deducted from your paycheck if you referred to Gameworks as either one of those in the presence of a manager. Gameworks was an experience. It's originating concept was what would happen if a bunch of 90's tweens were to find an old abandoned building that was powered by \"Surge\" soda. The magical new super caffeinated mountain dew alternative for tweens living the extreme.  \n\nThe credit system they used was supposed to be easy on parents and tweens alike. Mom or Dad could buy a card that could be used in every part of Gameworks excluding the bar. That way a kid didn't have to carry around actual money and could play games, get a burger and fries, drink some SURGE!!!! ect.ect.  Video games had cup holders and fries were served in cups so kids could snack as they played. \n\nUpstairs there was a coffee bar, a regular bar, and a full restaurant. They had leather couches and chairs in parts of the bar and coffee bar. They had an area for retro 80's games. Most importantly they had two special attractions known as Vertical Reality and the INDY 500. In the middle of the upstairs they had a professional sound and video board with some of the latest equipment available at the time. They had actual DJ's that were called Play Jockeys controlling video and audio feeds to the 5 different quadrants of the building. During the initial year of opening I witnessed lines outside the door of people trying to get in the door . They had over a thousand people riding the indy 500 hundred  each week during the summer. They had contest with great prizes like Superbowl tickets, Harley Davidson, and one Halloween they gave away a stand up House of the Dead arcade game. \n\nNow the decline-\nEvery company has a vision and talking points that they pass off as their do's and don'ts. Gameworks always wanted  to have staff available to assist people. The first notice of decline of course was under staffing. No longer were people greeting others, giving them a random free play on the games. Instead of running multiple lines of Vertical reality which had multiple bays they would only keep open one or two.  Instead of having announcers always stationed at indy 500 a sign was put in place that said see attendant for assistance.  Secondly the one golden rule they swore they would never, ever, ever, EVER BREAK... Gameworks will never have redemption games. Tickets were considered evil, instead they had a gift shop where you could buy things like shirts, shot glasses, and all kinds of other crap you could possibly find as prizes at other places.  They day I walked in and saw the first game spitting tickets and the words redemption, I felt I was kicked in the nuts. The final straw would be the multiple changes to the bar. Certain liquors, beers, ect were gone. Certain specialty drinks gone. Great bartenders gone. Happy hour host and play jockey's gone. The music is now a loop, the play Jockey audio and visual station is not used. Last time I was in there the bartenders were using jigs, had no flair, and most importantly were more concerned with trying to  get the one girl who was in the bar to talk to them instead of making money by serving drinks, up selling, and keeping conversation with multiple patrons. Gone was the once warm inviting atmosphere, and instead I felt like I was having a drink poured for me by a 21 year old holding a liquor bottle for the first time. \n\nAt this point the once great establishment that I have spent thousands of dollars at between 97 and 2007 has become a poor depressing shell of what it once was. You could actually close the bar, get rid of the restaurant and put a pizza place upstairs and they could probably pull off a chucky cheese gig and be more profitable then what they appear to me. \n\nOpportunities for improvement-\nIt is my firm belief that Gameworks has the chance to reinvent themselves if they would try a radical approach . At this time they have at least 3 or 4 great spaces that they could potentially use for LAN gaming and console gaming. It would very easy to set up multiple consoles and a internal LAN and do a pay for the hour or day thing. Much like Howie's game shack in mesa riverview. They also need to go back to the night club ambiance after 8pm. Bring back the play jockeys and the hostesses. Bring back that feeling of warmth.\n\n\nUpdate as of  7/21/13\nAttraction rides have been taken out. Many of the non-redemption games looked in horrible shape.

These events have really soured my experience with this location. Normally when I go to Gameworks, I play a few games and everything is fine. However, on two occasions, the staff has been incredibly rude. One night, one of the staff yelled racial slurs at that group out of nowhere. We called upon his manager to get an apology, but the offender only claimed that it was an accident that he yelled out all those words. It was definitely no accident as he tailed our group to the outside of the building and shouted those words.\n\nOn a second occasion, after playing a few games with our group, my sister and I sat down and took a break at one of their tables for a few minutes. One of the employees came over and said they were watching us the entire time, and that if we did not play any games, they would ask us to leave the establishment. It is odd that they have been watching us, and it is odd because we HAD been playing games, albeit not as many as the others. I will note that we are Asian and post-college, but we dress and act like any other American women, so I have no idea why we were treated this way.\n\nDespite all this, Gameworks can be a place for a fun outing depending on who is on staff at the moment. Unfortunately, I don't think I will be returning to this location again.\n\nNOTE ADDED 5/15/13: \nBelow it seems like a representative of Gameworks offered a way to contact me in regards to my experience.

In the past year, Gameworks has transitioned from a two-story video game mecca to a trashy, shotgun-style Dave and Buster's knock-off with a few old racing and carnage games sprinkled along the wings. What was once full of racing simulation games, a multi-story pirate-cum-balloon fight (or for the old folks, it used to be a shooting tower), and new-age arcade games, has become a vacuous shell with half-corroded consoles and token-munching, brainless ticket dispensers. \n\nMuch of the interior has been gutted, leaving odd walking patterns and vast arrays of blank canvas. 10-15% of the arcade games were \"under repair\" and another 5-10% were in great need of service (Virtua Tennis now has the cinematography of a Lumiere Bros. film). The remaining games feature nothing you could not find in the lobby of a movie theatre. Instead, Gameworks' focus is on ticket-oriented games such as Deal or No Deal and some game where you jump in the air and get tickets depending on when you land in relation to an arbitrary, electronic lighting wheel.\n\nIf that level of lowest common denominator banality thrills you, change this rating to 5 stars.\n\nIf I'm scraping the bottle of the barrel for positivity, I can compliment their beer selection (San Tan and 4 Peaks) and pricing (5 bones a pint); however, that does not justify the large-scale Peter Piper Pizza whitewashing of Gameworks' product line.\n\nI'm giving it a courtesy star for the fond memories, but, like Lady Liberty on the beachhead, Gameworks is completely broken.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 3, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Fun place to go on Thursdays when you can get the unlimited game card from I believe 6-10.

I had some chocolate cake that tasted purely of sweetener, and upon trying my friend's cheesecake (at an extortionate \u00a33.50 per slice), I was met with an almost identical taste. What's worse is that some of the cakes are priced by weight rather than per slice. Now, mass of cake is quite hard to estimate just by eye, and so you will often end up paying much more than you had anticipated. Furthermore, they offer ready meals at around four pounds each, the portions of which are verging on pathetic. \n\nThe staff here are also a bit hit or miss.

Another of my flatmates was short changed, and when he pointed this out to the cashier, he was again given incorrect change. \n\nPeckham's certainly has great variety of goods on offer, most of which cannot be easily found elsewhere, hence the three stars.

I had high expectations for Twisted Rose Winery and Eatery and TRWE fell below on every single one.\n\nMy husband (J) and I came here for lunch during the middle of the week. There was ample parking outside and as we walked up, we commented how nice the small patio looked. There were quite a few patrons enjoying the patio but no one inside. It was completely dead - not even a waiter in sight. J and I waited near the hostess stand before I abandoned J to use the washroom to wash my hands. The bathrooms are cute with wine barrels and kitschy signs about drinking wine. When I came out, J was finally being seated outside. J said a waiter took pity on him and seated him; apparently there wasn't a hostess during lunch. \n\nWe waited on the patio with menus for a while before our official waiter showed up to take our drink order. Just water for us boring folk - the waiter tried to talk us into iced tea or an Arnold Palmer. We politely declined and he came back later with two empty water glasses and a wine decanter filled with water. He then disappeared for quite some time. At this point, there is only 3 other groups of patrons dining on the patio - one older gentleman, a group of 3 women, and a middle aged couple. The place is not busy, but waiters are scarce. \n\nLooking at the menu, all lunches come with kettle chips. The menu does not go into detail about the chips. However I overheard a waiter describing the chips to another patron and he said they were Lays Kettle Chips. I was a little disappointed because at a fancy winery/eatery, I would expect them to make their own in-house chips. Vetoing the chips, I decided to splurge and pay an extra $1.50 to upgrade my side to bacon mac and cheese with tomatoes. (Another disappointment as it wasn't very flavorful and the promised bacon was non-existent.)\n\nWhen our waiter finally came back to take our order, my husband decided to order the lunch special of white fish tacos for $10. He did not upgrade his side and received Lays Kettle Chips with two tacos. The tacos consisted of white fish (probably mahi mahi) with a drizzle of some sort of green sauce. The flour tortillas seemed hard and stale. He didn't enjoy it and the one bite I had wasn't anything special. \n\nI ordered the Fresh Turkey Delight - which is a turkey, mango, gruyere and mustard sandwich for $12. I will say that it tasted good, but after about 6 bites, it was gone. It was the tiniest sandwich I have ever received at a restaurant and for $12, I expected a lot more bang for my buck.\n\nI would also like to point out that it took well over 20 minutes to get our food. When we finally did receive our food, my husband asked for the check since we had to get back to work. Our waiter took his sweet time getting the check to us and when he finally did, he told us today was not a good day.  I could not agree more and we hightailed it out of there. \n\nOverall, my experience here was rather lackluster and disappointing.

Hot Hula Fitness just finished up when we arrived. When we sat down to eat there was Thai acrobatics followed by a Tai Chi demo, then Ronald McDonald telling corny jokes and performing magic tricks.

And Sin City Cupcakes...alcohol infused cupcakes...need I say more??? I'll follow up with separate Yelp reviews for them.  Ive learned from attending past foodie festivals to take cash since some of the vendors and food trucks do not take debit/credit cards.  So bring cash with you! \n\nThe admission price initially might scare people away but note it's good for both days with in & out privileges. Kids get in free if they are a certain height! (so tell the taller kids to bend at the knees a lil bit so you're under the 48\" limit ..haha..)

For 2 hours I think that I get $25 worth of fun.  If you're really wanting to blow a day here, they have all day passes for $35. \r\n\r\nThe game selection is good, for the most part.  They have an alley of classic retro games along with the normal slew of shooters (House of the Dead series seems to be big since they have HotD 2-4) and racing games.  You can also play air hockey and mini-basketball.  The problem I found is that, especially during peak times, all the players migrate to the newest, coolest games so you might be stuck playing Deer Hunter the entire night.  Still, there is a good selection so I'm sure that you can find something you like while you wait it out to play the latest and greatest.  Definitely survey the scene before you commit your dough.\r\n\r\nThere were a couple problems I encountered which diminished my experience.  First, there were a decent number of out-of-order games, one that even went on the fritz while I was playing it so I had to stop.  That's annoying, especially if it's one of the more popular games.  Second, the swipe cards that they give you to use for your unlimited play seem to be reaaaaaaally picky.  Have you ever had a friend who is 5' 5\" and swears that he'll never date anyone shorter than him who likes cats and won't wear blue and isn't a brunette and won't go with him to strip shows and smokes and hasn't voted in the last 4 gubernatorial elections and is between the ages of 22-25?  That's what these cards are like.  There is nothing more annoying than being \"on the clock\" trying to eff up Darth Vader's poo and have your card suddenly not be readable by the video game.  If it doesn't work within 10 seconds you have to start from the beginning, which drives me nuts.  When we asked one of the employees about it he was really nice and coached us on how to use them but we still experienced quite a few problems.  I'm one of those guys who likes to finish video games so this was a huge deal for me.  UGH.  The third problem is that I got a blister from playing House of the Dead 4.  That was not Gameworks fault  though; maybe I just have tender hands?  In any case, cool game.  Zombies, meet the wrath of my UZI!  \r\n\r\nI would recommend checking this place out if you are into video games.  Do the math and figure out whether an unlimited play or debit card is right for you.  Without the pressure of \"the clock\" and getting your money's worth, some of the problems I mentioned might be avoided.  Also, try out the climbing wall, it's pretty fun (I climbed to the top).  \r\n\r\nIf nothing else, think of it this way:  at least those are 2 hours that you spent not playing the dollar slots so you actually made money!", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Gamesworks is a large arcade and rock climbing place on the strip. \r\nPretty good sized, could spend a couple of hours being occupied.

There is a restaurant on the right side.\nPRODUCT: Okay, I figured out the trick to get all my 4 siblings to play at Gameworks on 1 all day pass card. The all day pass includes only the video games (not ticket games such as claw machine, wheel of fortune, rolling ball game, etc).  So once you swipe your card there is a delay of approximately 1 minute before swiping again so if you keep on swiping during your game play then you can accumulate lots of credits. Also you can be swiped in simultaneously on different machines just as long as the 1 minute delay is considered. The only way this will work is to have a designated card swiper to run around and keep on rotating swipes in case anyone loses lives. This was actually relatively easy to do and of course I was the swiper.\nAt least at the other arcades at NY NY and Excalibur I saw some people winning at the claw machine BUT not a single person at Gameworks. Their claw machines only had 2 prongs instead of the traditional 3. Hmmm...... I don't think anyone EVER wins those things at Gameworks.\nMany games were broken down but many other games were running. I think this is just typical of an arcade. There weren't sooo many broken down such that it hindered the experience. There was still a good selection of games. They even have a \"classic\" section with pinball machines, pac-woman, etc.\nPRICES: 1 all day pass card which is $35 with a $2 card activation fee if you don't own a plastic card already. At the end of the night around 10:30 pm I sold the card for $5, which was good for unlimited play until 1 am. Not bad! We definitely used more than the cards worth if we were just using coins each time.\nTIPS: To redeem tickets you must have your card to redeem. I sold the card before redeeming our tickets but the front desk gave us a copy of our old card no problem. Also a tix-for-tonite counter is upstairs so while the kids play games you can go check out deals/wait in line. No coins are used in this arcade so if you want money for games you will have to buy a plastic Gameworks card ($2) and place money on that to swipe on the machines.\nSERVICE: No complaints here. \nCONCLUSION: Not the nicest arcade but not bad in keeping the kids entertained for an entire day. They enjoyed having free reign over any game they wanted for once with the all day pass, which is a good deal if you have a \"swiper\" running around.

While I was playing the Maximum Tuning 3 in gameworks the four arcade systems were not linked up together even though it would be enjoyable to race against my cousin and other people.

The only thing about it is the machines still do not carry the cards to save data on it and play it later, because I luckily had a card that was that version and I began to play the game but sadly I ran out of certain number of plays a card can handle. I needed the machine to at least have 1 brand new card so I can update the card and play where I left off.\n\n------ Little info. on what I mean about the cards.\nThe cards are considered memory cards for the game. Each card has a sixty game life, meaning if you lose a race, win a race, time race, ghost battle, and etc. it counts down until zero, when it reaches zero the player puts the card back in and the machine will offer to get a new card.

I chose the Klingon one first because I never much cared for the Borg episodes, and then afterward I didn't have time to go on the other ride. Despite the ride itself being only about 20 minutes, you have to wait for it to start, and then if you're going back, make your way back and wait for the other ride. Unfortunately, I didn't have time for both.\n\nKlingon Encounter was fun, mostly. I won't spoil the details, but let's just say that it's as close as any of us is going to come to really visiting the world of ST:TNG. It was slightly hokey, but pretty well done overall, with some impressive live special effects. There is a motion simulator ride as part of Klingon Encounter. While it was in some ways fun, I did start to feel that I was being jerked around rather a lot, and by the end of it I did feel a tiny bit nauseous. The weak-stomached are hereby warned.

We were famished so we all decided to dive into our food. Low and behold, the food was COLD!! Like cold cold! Rubber cold eggs. My medium steak was so overcooked, I thought I was chewing cardboard. We all had maybe 5 bites of our food and we just gave up. I really wanted to run into the kitchen to check on my suspicions of the chef being a one armed, drunk, retard.\n\nWorse thing (well personally). They charged me for my beer that was supposed to be included in the special. I mean, it was just $1.50, but if you advertise the free beer with the special, then you should honor it. I was too fed up to deal with this place to argue the case. In the end, I paid 10 bucks and I felt like if I would have flushed that 10 bucks down the toilet, it would have been more fulfilling. The bill came to be $35.60 bucks or so, and we left $36 and got the hell out. \n\nWe weren't the only ones that were complaining that night. Some people were sat at a table and no waiter came by for 20 minutes. They just left. The guys next to us were bitching about the same things we were. Another table straight up skipped out after a waiting.\n\nSo we weren't the ones frustrated with this place. That $6.99 thing must be the only thing they have to lure customers in, otherwise I don't know why anyone would ever come here, because I know I'm not coming back.

Don't look for the $6.99 steak dinner on the menu though, it's an off menu special that is widely known to locals who patronize this casino that's barely a mile east of the strip.  Our hero can tell this restaurant is great when most of the diners are obese locals.\n\nAs for the actual casino, it's a bit dingy and old, but has some lower limits that make for cheap gambling.\n\nPROS:\n- Restaurant is open 24 hours.\n- Good selection of $1.50 micro beers at the bar or restaurant.\n- Awesome off-menu steak dinner deal.\n- $3 blackjack tables and $4 roulette.\n\nCONS:\n- Expect to wait 15 minutes for a table and another 15 minutes for service at the restaurant during peak hours.\n- Not a whole lot in terms of cocktail service.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 8, "useful": 9, "cool": 9}}, {"text": "I love how it's 24 hour at the restaurant.

If you are looking for tasty food at a low price, this place may be for you.  Their menu consists of three items: full rack of ribs, half rack of ribs, and half bbq chicken half rack of ribs.  All entrees come with corn on the cobb, cole slaw, baked beans, and toast with butter.\n\nI got the half bbq chicken half rack of ribs.  I should mention the ribs are baby back ribs.  The cost was $8.99.  \n\nThe bbq chicken was moist, the sauce was good.  The ribs were really moist and the sauce was good.  \n\nHere's the deal, there is no smoke flavor, none at all that I could have distinguished either on the chicken or ribs.  There was no smoke ring on the meat of the ribs.  The ribs were missing that slight tug when the meat comes off the bone of a rib that was cooked slow and low on a bbq.  Did the meat fall off the bone?  Yes it did, but more like how the meat falls off the bone when you boil the ribs so they're tender or how meat falls off the bone when you braise something or similar to it.  And yes, I really do think they boil the ribs first as there was no real pork flavor.\n\nThe chicken was akin to tender broasted chicken from say Costco or Boston Market, except is had BBQ sauce on it.  Was it good? Yes, but it wasn't legit BBQ chicken.\n\nThe sides were less than stellar.  The corn on the cobb was limp.  All the kernels were not plump.  The majority of the juiciness was probably from the pot of water they used to boil the corn.  The cole slaw was fine, it would have been better if it had more of the dressing mixed in, but it was fresh and crunchy still.  The baked beans were on the verge of being flavorful.  The slices of bread they gave me were rye, they tried toasting it, but they still couldn't save it from being stale bread it was.\n\nDidn't try the beer so I can't comment on the legitimacy of their brewery.\n\nI like sauce and their BBQ sauce managed to make the food tasty, at least in my opinion it did.

First off I have to say that the service here is pretty bad.  They're kinda slow and it's usually busy so that doesn't help.  It sometimes takes a while for them to decide who your server is and/or for them to come take your order.  \nThat said, I still come to Ellis to eat because the food's good and it can be very cheap.  You kinda have to know about the specials tho.  (don't think they're on the menu)  Basically, I get 1 of 2 things when I go.  Either the \"Dinner Special\" (soup or salad, nice sized thick cut steak, potato and green beans, and a beer which they brew there; all for $6.99)  It says on the place mats that they are one of the top 10 breweries in America.  I'm not a beer expert, but it is good and they have a variety of kinds to choose from.  They're cheap too at somewhere around $2.  They even make their own Root Beer, (which you can get with the dinner special instead of a beer) but beware that it's very, very sweet.  \nThe other thing I order is the steak and eggs for $4.99 (thin but decent steak, eggs made-to-order, hash-browns, and toast.)  Both are a great value.  The dinner more so therefore I usually get that.  I have eaten the steamed clams a couple times as well and they are delicious!  They also have a BBQ restaurant at which, I've been told, are the best ribs in Vegas.  Sadly I haven't eaten there yet but I look forward to checking it out.  :) \nBTW, to my fellow Casino Employees:  bring your badge and get 2 free drinks at the bar from 3am-8am.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Amazing brewery and Philly steak sandwich for less than $10!

Really?!? \n\nI think a lot of the time people go into a place with really low expectations and then when a place is better than they expected they think it is better than it is and rate it higher than they should. That has to be the case with the restaurant at Ellis Island. \n\nThat's not to say the place isn't good because it is. I went there this past weekend when we were looking for a cheap steak and someone recommended this place. When we arrived we noticed that there was a big food truck festival out front. You would think with everyone eating from the trucks that the restaurant would be empty, but much to my surprise there was still a 30 minute wait for a table. \n\nTurned out that was good cause it gave me time to get a tetanus shot which should be required upon entering the building. After checking out the food truck festival and chatting with people at the Yelp booth I sat down at a video poker machine to gamble for a little bit until the table was ready. True story, one of the girls from the Yelp table took a break and came over to where I was playing video poker and hit on me! Awesome!! (for the record she was cute as hell, but I had other plans for that night). \n\nOkay, back to the review. When they finally got around to seating us and after looking at the menu we decided on the fillet special. For $7.99 you get a steak, vegetable, choice of potato, soup or salad and one of their homemade beers or root beer. \n\nI chose the salad, which legally qualified as salad because it had lettuce. Don't expect much from it though, it is literally lettuce, salad dressing, 2 cherry tomatoes and nothing else. It was fine, but nothing special. \n\nWhen the dinner came, I was a little disappointed in the vegetable offering. The special came with green beans, but I don't like green beans so I asked if there was another vegetable offering and the waiter offered to replace the green beans with the mixed vegetable which turned out to be more green beans with some corn and carrots mixed in. I didn't try them. My friend had the green beans and initially said they were good, but then didn't eat them, so take from that what you will. \n\nThe baked potato was perfectly fine. It's kinda hard to mess up a baked potato and they didn't. \n\nThe steak was a very pleasant surprise. I honestly didn't expect much from a $7.99 steak in this kind of place, but it was very good. Tender, no real gristle cooked exactly as I had ordered it. I ate every bite and was very satisfied by it. \n\nHaving major drinking plans for later that night, we just got the root beer as our drink. I have to say, the homemade root beer was damned tasty. And I highly recommend that! \n\nThe service was okay, but we weren't offered any dessert. \n\nThe atmosphere was like a Coco's that hasn't been updated in 30 years and was quite loud. \n\nSo look, is the place bad? Definitely not! \n\nIs it worthy of 4-stars? Absolutely not! \n\nWas it the best $7.99 steak I have ever had? YES! \n\nI can't say I would go back and I can't say that I would recommend it, but I wouldn't avoid going back and wouldn't tell anyone else to avoid it either.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Great place came down here and got the steak speical.

They were juicy, full of flavor and cooked to perfection. If you like dry burgers or food that isn't messy, these are not for you.

AWESOME deal, but if only the quality was as good as the price. Can't have the bet of both worlds right?\n\nI had a soup, which was Cream of Mushroom at the time. A bit watered down and lacked salt, but not too bad. The steak is where they just went downhill, but I really wasn't expecting anything better from such a place. It lacked any marination, was all burnt on the outside, and was just overall bland and charred. The mashed potatoes were great, though.\n\nAlso, they may claim to be the best brewery in Vegas, but I highly dispute that. Their dark beer was heavily watered down, was way too bitter for such a beer, and just didn't go with the meal at all.\n\nIn conclusion, get their mashed potatoes. Everything else sucks.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I'm torn with how many stars I should give this place.  The karaoke bar is a 0 out of 5, the rest of the casino and the restaurant are 5 out of 5. \n\nWe've been going to this place for years, namely for the $1 pints (I think they're $1.50 now, which is still super cheap).  They brew their own beer.  The Amber is my favorite...the light beer is not all that great.  Tons of gaming machines and a blackjack table.  Cocktail servers are usually pretty quick.  Also, they have a restaurant and a Metro Pizza in the casino.  Both are awesome.  The restaurant always has cheap specials, and the food is good considering the price range.  Metro Pizza always has slices ready to go, perfect after a ton of beer.  \n\nNow, on to the karaoke bar.  I've been to A LOT of karaoke shows in Vegas, and this is by far THE WORST.  Somehow it gets voted \"best of las vegas\" by the RJ every year.  They are the only place I know of that has karaoke every night of the week, and I think that's their big selling point.  The sound quality is absolutely ridiculous.  The KJ never touches anything to adjust volumes or mic settings (by the looks of it, they don't even have the equipment to do so).  This ends up in not being able to hear some people, while the really loud ones (especially drunk screaming girls) are just so overpowering that it's annoying.  They have probably the smallest karaoke song selection I've ever seen.  There's no instrumentals or bumper music in between the singers, so it goes from super loud shitty quality sound to dead silence while waiting for the next singer to get up.  I was there 3 hours and sang 2 songs.  By the way, tipping the KJ does nothing at all.  No matter the offer, she won't bump you up in rotation even a few spots, or stay past the end time whatsoever.  \"November Rain\" by GNR somehow got cut from 8 1/2 minutes to 4 1/2.  Then during \"Sad But True\" by Metallica, I replaced one of othe lyrics with the f-bomb, and you would have thought I was a terrorist or something.  Security came up to me and said \"sir, did you see that lyric on the screen? No, then you need to leave\".  So, good luck if you want to sing songs like Cee-Lo's F-you, Tenacious D's F-Her Gently, Lonely Island's I'm On a Boat, or any of the adult parodies like Summer Nights or With Legs Wide Open.  I would understand if it were a family environment, but you have to be 21 to even get in the karaoke bar.  And it's shut off from the rest of the casino in such a way that you can only hear the karaoke from inside the karaoke bar area. \n\nI'd much rather take my business to one of the PT's Pubs karaoke nights, where the hosts are upbeat and they actually enjoy being there.  Also, the sound equipment is professional with a full mixer board for the music & mics.  And the song selection is literally 10X what Ellis Island has.  Sahara/Decatur on Saturdays is one of my favorites.

Some of the tables that were seated well after us were either eating, or getting their checks before we saw our dinner. \n\nSteak - Both of us ordered Medium Rare. J's was almost blue. Seared but still very pink in the center. But it was warm to the touch, so he decided to not send it back. Now this I cant understand. You almost under-cook a steak, but its still tough!? How do you accomplish that feat?! My steak on the other hand was more on the well done side than medium rare. Terrible. I took maybe 2 bites. I'm sure boot leather would have tasted better. J ate maybe 1/4 of his steak. He's a huge steak fan, so that's gotta show you that something is wrong. \n\nSalad (mine) - You can't really screw up a salad. \nSoup (J's) - He said it was \"alright\". \n\nBaked Potato - This was the best part of the whole meal. \n\nGreen Beans - This was a tie for the best part of the meal. Lots of garlic, which J and I love. \n\nBread - Love sourdough, but this was almost inedible. \n\nBeer - J ordered an Amber. Since I do not drink, I asked if I could have a diet soda. No Dice. So I ordered a beer and gave it to J. And just stuck with water. \n\nHe said just for the beer's alone, it was almost worth $7.99 a piece.

I mentioned to J that if he wanted to learn to play craps, now was his chance. When there were other players, there were maybe 1-2 tops.

It's pretty much my go-to when I'm strapped for cash but still want a restaurant experience with courses. Doesn't hurt that the beers crafted in house are only $1.75.\n\nIs this the best steak you'll ever have? Heck no. But where else can you regularly get soup or salad to start, and a filet cut top sirloin with choice of potato and green beans for $8? Nowhere, I tell you. The best part about this deal? It comes with a free beer (or rootbeer.. get a beer, sissy). And their beers are pretty darn good.\n\nI personally love the taste of sirloin. I think filet mignon is overrated in everything but it's tenderness (ribeye.. that is all.) The sirloin at Ellis is hit or miss, really, both in preparation and in quality. Sometimes I've gone and it's been tender, and sometimes my jaw is sore by the end of dinner. I usually order medium-rare and it's usually medium or medium-well, occasionally rare, and once in a blue moon, cooked correctly. The green beans are fresh green beans and are sometimes still crisp, and sometimes really mushy and buttered with loads of fresh garlic. The baked potato is standard, and the mashed potatoes come with gravy that is much like cafeteria gravy and is oddly satisfying in that way.. steak fries are steak fries. The soups change day to day and range from chili to New England clam chowder (surprisingly good). The salads are your standard iceberg romaine carrot purple cabbage mix with croutons and cherry tomatoes, but their Italian dressing is made in house and it is bangin'.\n\nOther dishes: Orange Roughy - delicious. Fish n Chips - delicious! (Same as Village Pub, but cheaper at Village Pub). Clams - good, fresh. French onion soup - super greezy. I think the bread they use is a piece of garlic bread. They also have the mandatory casino breakfast specials that seem like a good deal, I've never tried them.\n\nThis is an $8 steak. This is not a steak house. This is the kind of steak that benefits from being cooked a little more by getting just a bit more tender.. go medium-rare. For the price, you won't have any regrets.

Trashy casino slightly off the strip.  Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I stopped by several years ago with my fam bam because Dad read that they had good pizza at Metro Pizza. My mom put one foot in the door and immediately turned around and said let's go.  We'll get back to this.\n\nI came again around 7am a few nights ago for some steak and eggs, recommended by the valet at Artisan Boutique Nightclub/Hotel, and by our cab driver.  This is apparently where every cab driver comes for their steak and eggs, $5.99.  The food was nothing to write home about, very standard.  Clientele was ALL cab drivers, divided into various ethnic groups, telling outrageous cab stories.  I did feel a little awkward, my friend and I being the only girls in there for awhile, and being stared down by the cab drivers.  The waitress was attentive, and she knew the cabbies like regulars.  We easily scored a cab home (this comment will make sense in a bit).  I would have rather gone to the Peppermill.\n\nThe next night we came back to sample the pizza (since my dad said it was good years ago) and check out the karaoke bar.  Metro Pizza is 2 for 1 large pizza's on Sundays. Good deal if you ask me.  There is however, no place to sit and eat your pizza.  You can sit in the adjacent booths only after 10pm, because they are really only for the BBQ place.  I thought the pizza was pretty good, but I would have rather had it delivered to my room.\n\nThe real irony came when we were unable to find a taxi after our pizza feast. Not a single one to be found. There were 20+ drivers there not 14hrs ago! We walked to the hotel next door, and they called a cab for us and some other folks.  One showed up about 25 minutes later, and he told us to walk to the 7-11, that there were 2 sitting there. Make sure you have a ride home, because this place is not on the regular taxi circuit.\n\nTo sum it up, I would not come back unless I had to, and I would have their pizza delivered to my lazy butt.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 2, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "this 5 star review is only for the $5.99 steak and egg breakfast that they serve in their little restaurant every day after midnight til the wee hours in the morning.

Not far from the strip, the place is small and a dive which is fine. We got there just as a contest was beginning and as far as the Karaoke was concerned, it was fun and engaging.\n\nThe service and the drinks however...left a lot to be desired. If you go, order beer because they pour the weakest mixed drinks...ever!!!! In fact calling them mixed drinks is an insult to mixed drinks. We were a little buzzed when we got there and and literally sobered up after drinking their pathetic offerings.\n\nI ordered a white Russian and when it arrived I was treated to a glass of cream and ice with about a 16th of an inch of Kahlua at the bottom and no discernible vodka. The smallest strip of liquor I've ever seen in a drink claiming to be a white Russian. \n\nI hadn't been paying attention when the waitress dropped it off so I had to wait for her to make the rounds again to draw her attention to it. When she finally made it back, I showed her and she told me that it \"comes out of the gun like that\". So this \"full bar\" is using premixed white Russian concoctions? No. It didn't occur to me until later that of course she was lying because you can't get a mixed drink like that to pour separately out of a gun, it would be a solid color and I wouldn't have seen the paper thin stripe of Kahlua at the bottom. So I gave her the drink and asked her to take it off the bill and she left.\n\nShe comes back a few minutes later with the drink and tells me she told the manager and they added a free shot of Kahlua to it and now the strip is gone like they stirred it. So benefit of the doubt, I'm thinking it looks like they're trying to make things right. I take a sip and it's like drinking slightly sweetened cream in ice. No hint of alcohol in the slightest.\n\nMeanwhile, my friend had ordered an Adios Mother F****r which should have been named a 'See Ya later, Pal' because like my drink, his didn't even had stiff language in it. He kept his though after watching the little dance I was doing with the waitress. \n\nWhen she returned again, I told her that the drink was still horrible. I didn't want it. The glass was still full and to take it back. She did and mostly avoided our table the rest of the evening. At one point she came by and asked my friend if he wanted another and he told her he'd rather not pay $11 for another blue lemonade.\n\nI don't know about the food everyone else talked about on Yelp because after 9 they only served a small list of appetizers that were okay from our sampling in the karaoke area. Nothing I would worry about getting again but not the worst I ever had. The Karaoke was fun and the singers were actually a mixture of really good and really bad,..basically what you want from karaoke.\n\nWhen she finally brought the check, there was the white Russian living large at full price for all to see. It had not been removed and no manager ever came by to see what he could do. They just didn't give a crap whether we came back or if we told anyone or EVERYONE on the internet how crappy it was.\n\nSo the bottom line is: if you go, drink beer and NOTHING ELSE because they will completely screw you as evidenced with them trying to charge me for a small glass of cream that may or may not at one time have been sitting next some alcohol but the inside of the glass never saw any.\n\nBut if you want to Karaoke, there are plenty of places you can go where they might respect their customers at least a little and/or be aware that there is this thing called the internet where people will tell other people how poorly(pourly?) they think of the people they expect money from.", "review_stars": 1, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Prime rib was great, and only $12, big selection, great beer!

I was really looking forward to a \"steak\" dinner. We were unenthusiastically \"greeted\" by a hostess who told us there was a 20 minute wait. Odd, the restaurant was more than half empty...in fact the casino was almost empty. The hostess then directed my attention to a printer paper sign stating the kitchen is being cleaned and anyone who arrives after 9:30 pm will only be able to order off of a limited menu. As we were given a 20 minute wait time I asked the hostess if we would be able to get the steak dinner...she said no. I told her we were there now and if we were seated by 9:30, the supposed cut off time, would we be able to order the steak dinner...she said no. I explained we came specifically for the steak dinner, having walked from the strip, and asked if there was any way we could get the steak dinner...she said no. I then asked to speak to the manager.\n\nAfter a long wait the manager finally arrived...with a security guard. Really, a security guard? Please look at my Yelp picture...do I look like a threat? The manager stood about 2 inches from my face and proceeded to tell me No over and over again. He kept interrupting me when I pointed out his restaurant was empty, that the hostess was specifically giving wait times so that that people would have to order off the limited menu, etc. I told him his manner and policies were completely unacceptable. I finally just asked, \"Am I going to be able to order a steak dinner?\" He got even closer to me and yelled, \"No!\" I then informed him that I would make sure to tell everyone about this terrible experience and he yelled in a close and threatening manner, \"Don't threaten me!\" I told him that I was not threatening, just informing him that this is what is going to happen and this is what happens when people receive horrible customer service like this. We then walked out, while the manager continued to yell at us.\n\nAmazing! I have never had an experience like this.

Two of use ordered the Prime rib (so glad I did). We also ordered some an appetizer entree that consisted of 3 Wings, 3 Onion Rings, 2 Potato Skins, 2 Chicken Strips, and 3 Cheese sticks. When they came, they were pretty greasy, and expected as much.\n\nI want to note that the few waiters we had were awesome, and made the trip even better. \n\nOnce the entrees came, the Prime Ribs were awesome for the price. They were juicy, had flavor and big portions. The other 2 entree's weren't that great. The chicken wrap was average and the top sirloin was over cooked in certain places and under cooked in certain places and had no flavor. The mashed potatoes tasted like dirt, so glad I wasn't the one that ordered it. \n\nAs expected the Prime Rib was awesome.

He suggested Ellis Island Casino, which brews its own beer onsite. It sounded like a good idea. I remembered the name of the casino from my last trips to Vegas 4-5 years ago, but couldn't place it. And then he pulled into the lot and I said to myself  \"Oh, it's THIS place\"\n\nEllis Island Casino and Brewery is a small, divey casino off the strip with a Super 8 attached to it. Classy. My friend digs dive spots, and I don't have a problem with them ... but I was skeptical about the quality of their beer and tempered my expectations. Which was a good idea, because the beer was a disappointment.\n\nThey offer five house-made brews of standard varieties - Light, Amber Ale, Weiss, Stout, and IPA. I started with the IPA and noticed that it had absolutely NO flavor. How can an IPA have NO flavor? I thought maybe he poured the wrong beer, but I saw him pour from the IPA tap. Maybe the lines were mixed up with the light? This would have been acceptable for a light beer - it was crisp and not unpleasant tasting. Rather, it was just flavorless.   \n\nAfter chugging it down, I went for the stout. This was a better choice, but still just an average stout at best. It reminded me more of a porter than a stout, and similar to Yeungling's porter. Acceptable, but nothing to write home about. \n\nMy friend, like many Vegas locals, love this place. And I kinda dig the seedy, divey vibe as well. And he says their house-made root beer is outstanding (I have never tried it). But the beer was disappointing. If that was really their IPA, then they need a reality check on what a true IPA is supposed to be. \n\nIf you're looking for a microbrewery in a casino, Triple 7 downtown is the way to go, not Ellis Island.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Little hole in the wall in a tiny casino.

We have been coming to Vegas for over 20 years and spend plenty of time at the black jack tables.\n\nRestaurant's get four stars but casino only one star on this trip.\n\nThe cafe was great (as always) we both had the steak special. The salad was good and the steak was cooked properly.  The in-house root beer was delicious and dad enjoyed the micro-brew.\n\nBBQ was equally delicious.  We both got a full rack of ribs, our hotel room had a fridge for left overs.  They could do without the corn on the cob.  Why serve corn on the cob when you let it sit in a pan of water and it turns out soggy rather than crunchy?  They could roast the corn on the grill and have it turn out awesome.\n\nWe have played black jack in the casino many times.  They have good rules. decent limits and friendly dealers.  They have older pit boss who has been there forever, an older gentleman.  He always seemed less than pleasant and a bit offish.  We had an incident where the dealer misdealt and had to call the boss over.  He told her to burn the Ace.  the Ace would have helped my dad's hand and he would have taken the card whether he knew it was an Ace or not.  The boss said to burn it.  \n\nNow, whenever we have encountered something similar to this at other casinos (mistakes do happen) the boss would give the player the choice of taking or burning the card.  After all, it was the dealer's mistake, not ours.  When I spoke up (cause dad is 87) the boss rudely and gruffly said it's his casino and his rules.  End of discussion.\n\nAt that point we took our money off the table and left.  We will probably go back another day but we only play where we enjoy and have fun.

The first was the Amber Ale which was a true to style amber. The second beer I ordered was the IPA. Now the IPA, let me put it this way; I had to ask the waiter after a couple sips that he hadn't accidentally brought me the Light beer.  I then later also had the stout - while I played a hand of black jack - which was again a below average stout, no creativity: no wood aging or bourbon or dry hops nothing to make it stand out.  \n\nBut to get back to my wonderment of the 4 stars by my fellow yelpers; I fully understand the appreciation of this restaurant.

Originally we went for $6 steak dinner (not on the menu) and $1 draft beer. Since then, prices have raised- beers are now $2/pint at the bar, and $2.50 at the table. I in no way believe that's expensive, just pointing it out. Also- the steak special is now $12, unless you have a coupon, which you can only get if you have a player's card. With the coupon it's $9 or so. So keep that in mind when you come. \n\nHonestly the steak is pretty good but on our last trip, we ate here two times and I got different items instead. Once I got the chicken and rice pilaf, I can't remember the exact name. It was excellent- sauteed chicken breast, spinach, sundried tomatoes, and mushrooms on top of pilaf. It also came with salad. The next time I got \"no carb fried chicken\" which is just fried chicken without breading, and I will say that this made me rethink fried chicken completely. It was without a doubt much better than most fried chicken I've ever had, specifically because the skin was able to get very crispy not being battered, and the meat was incredibly moist and flavorful due to the skin being on. \n\nWe've definitely had some colorful visits here, and sometimes the food has been not as good. The steak can be chewy and tough at times, and once my father literally choked on it (like, there was a line of people giving him the Heimlich maneuver). However I think he blames it on his lack of chewing, not the food, since he happily returns here for the steak. I realize that's a bizarre endorsement but hey, it's gotta count for something. Our most recent visit, it was right after my birthday and right before my mother's birthday and our waiter brought us a free slice of their chocolate cake. Normally I wouldn't care much about free chocolate cake, but this was fantastic. It was also made in house and really made me see their desserts in a different light.

The one thing I can appreciate is the wait for a table.  There's always a wait.  Tells me that this place is worth checking out.  On this visit, our server was a little creepy.  He kept winking at us and stared us down, but in the end, hooked us up big time.  \n\nFor dinner, we got the steak dinner (which is not on the actual menu...it's on their secret menu!)  for $8.99.  It's usually $11.99 unless you have their players card.  Although the card is free, we didn't have one, but our server actually gave us the discount anyway.  That's how he hooked us up!  This meal comes with a thick cut of steak, mine cooked medium rare, choice of potato, I chose the baked potato, and garlic green beans.  This meal also comes with your choice of their in house brewed beers.  I chose the light beer, equivalent to a bud light.  The steak resembled a filet but only the look!  It was still delightful and a thick cut of meat.  Juicy and cooked just the way I like it.  The baked potato was just served with butter and sour cream.  Where's the chives?!?!  I loved the green beans.  Seems blanched with nice sized pieces of garlic.  Super good.  The beer was refreshing and perfect for the meal. \n\nThe one thing I love about my best friends in Vegas is the fact that they are so humble about the places they frequent.  They've turned me onto this place and the rest is history.  In my opinion, it's almost a five star.  I just can't give it that, as the places I've given five stars to before is in a whole other league.  Trust me though, I will be coming back to this place over and over again.  It's worth every last penny!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 3, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "This little casino has one of the best deals that you can probably get near the strip.

My coworker suggested this place the first time I went to Vegas a few months ago (yeah I'm a loser I waited way past I was 21 for my return to Vegas).

Still, I managed to pull my hungover self as a place to eat on the way back home on a Sunday and OMG I fell in love.  I ended up staying here a few hours longer than I expected and make it a point to come back here every time I'm in Vegas!  The first two times I came there was about a 20 minute wait, but the last time I came for lunch there was no wait at all.  I heard there is usually a wait so just make a Players Card and use the $10 credit they give you while you wait.\n\nThey don't have the prime rib as a special anymore but they have a top sirloin with a beer (regular brew or rootbeer) for $8.99 so I always order that instead.  The value for the type of food is spectacular!!!  The 8 oz steak I usually get medium-rare and usually is cooked to perfection except for one time (it was overcooked just a little but it was easily sent back).  It comes with a side of potatoes, green beans, and a salad.  The steak has a nice crust  and it so deliciously juicy.  All the sides taste like how they are supposed to and you'd be surprised by how not overcooked/soggy the canned beans taste cause they still have a slight crisp to them, and baked potatoes are pretty hard to mess up.  This last time I ordered a french onion soup and I thought it had a pretty decent flavor for being $4.99.

My sons and my boyfriend all had prime rib and thought it was good for that price.  I had the NY steak and shrimp.  I don't actually like shrimp but wanted that cut of steak.  My boyfriend ate the shrimp.  My steak was seasoned nicely and cooked well.  I like medium and it was probably a bit over-cooked but I, personally, prefer that to under.  Not really any complaints about the quality of the food.  You have to know when you see the prices  to not have super high expectations but they exceeded mine!  We were bummed that we were too full for desert!  4 meals, 4 beers at dinner and the bill was $59 and some change!

Usually it is great, but unfortunately it can be fairly inconsistent. My husband and I can order the exact same thing and our steaks look completely different and one can be medium well and one can be practically raw. 80% of the time, it is a great dinner, but it's that 20% that bums you out sometimes. Also, my daughter ordered the fried chicken once, and while 3 pieces were perfect, one was raw inside...obviously that is fairly dangerous and something that shouldn't have happened. \n\nI will say that we have brought all out of town family here, and they all love it, rave about the good deal, and the beer, and always want to go every time they come out, so there is something about this old school place that people (especially the old people) are drawn to. \n\nMy favorite thing about the whole place is the beer. I LOVE the Hefe Weiss. LOVE IT! It is dirt cheap or free if you get the steak special. Also, I find the more Hefe I drink the less I care about the bad stuff about this place ;-)\n\nAs everyone has said, it is extremely smoky.

We have watched karaoke in the bar, and my throat hurt for a day afterward because of all the smoke. Also there is one bathroom in the whole place and while I have never had to wait in line, that walk feels longer and longer as the night (and the beer drinking!) go on. \n\nSo I would say if you are NOT a foodie, like a super cheap meal, and can deal with some cigarette smoke, you will probably enjoy this place.

We passed on the $20 official photo, and also the light up swords and merlin hats, but the kids and bachelors were eating them up.\n\nLet me say: I tried really hard to have a good time and appreciate the effort it took to perform the show...and so I did have a good time.  The food service blocked my view occasionally, but I rolled with it.  The horses are amazing, and I say this as someone who grew up around the horse show/rodeo scene.  The plot line of the story is of course extremely cheesy and you are watching a choreographed show...entirely scripted.  Kids will have the best time, and adults will enjoy watching the kids having a great time.  Groups, especially large family groups with Grandparents all the way down to kids will also have a great time.  \n\nKid tip:  Disney World makes a better vacation for children...Excalibur is not Disney despite the castle.  You can make it work...but this is still an adult playground.   If you do happen to be in Vegas with children...cover their eyes (or yours!) past the Excaliber Party Pit because they have go-go dancers performing now on the betting tables.  Fun for adults; but I saw a 4 yr old with eyes like saucers.  Go directly downstairs to the Arcade and take your kids to Tournament of Kings.  The cast of the show greets you as you exit the show, and they take their time to thank you and pose for photos.  Then take your kids to the Grand Canyon, Hoover Dam, and check out some gold mining experiences...come back another time for yourself.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "This show was really fun.

They did this without saying anything. I was silly enough to assume that was ours to keep. I was utterly devastated when, at the end of the show, they came back around and told us it would be $20 to keep this picture pasted onto a piece of cardboard. I know we paid half price, but people pay as much as $70 a ticket and they want $20 more for something they're going to throw out anyway? I think that should have been worked into the price of the ticket, or at least have been considerably cheaper.

He said \"well now it's too late so drink it!\"  WTF dude, chill out.\n\nSecond, we're not to fans of eating with our hands when you only get one napkin so we asked for eating utensils.

Even the bartender at Dick's said it was exceptional. I was expecting something soooo good but what I got was typical tomato soup from a can that was served piping hot. Ok. The main course, Cornish game hen, whole chicken or whatever it was, was ok as well. It was served so friggin hot, I could barely pull off the legs and eat them without burning myself. I mean I get the whole \"no utensils in medieval times thing\" and while it added to the immersion of the event, it also took away from what could have been a good meal. The downside to eating a fresh hot chicken without utensils is by the time I could split the breast open and eat it without burning my hands, it was starting to get cold, and by then it was just meh.

I find this hard to believe and I think it is all predetermined ahead of time but we cheered our heads off anyway. We were seated in the Russia section and our knight was a bit of a cheater but it made it fun to watch and we cheered him on anyway. The whole event had a cool storyline too if you follow it. I won't give away any other details as it may spoil the show for some, but it had everything we expected. Singing, dancing, jousting, fancy horse riding, dazzling sword fighting, plus some nifty special effects.

OK. I went there with my cousins and my parents on the Fourth of July, and to be honest, it wasn't really my cup of tea. I'm not really a loud person, and it was a bit rowdy for my taste. The show, however, was superb. What really peaked my interest was the horses. They were all so gorgeous! Especially the Friesian (for those of you who aren't as horse-obsessed, the black horse that is ridden by the Dragon knight.) I did notice that one of the horses was favoring its right rear leg. I believe it was the dun, but I'm not completely sure. Anyway, back to my review. We were seated in Row D of the Austria section in seats 27- 32. Pretty good seats if you ask me. The service was a bit slow, but that can only be expected with a stadium full of people, and it was on a holiday. The show , in my opinion, was very well coordinated, and super entertaining to watch. The actors do a great job, and the horses know every move by heart. The other thing that I really liked was that the actors really knew how to get everyone involved in the show. That's a really smart idea, especially dealing with kids and teenagers that lose interest quickly. \n\nThe only thing that didn't really seem up to standard was the food. I have heard so many great reviews about the food, but for me I thought it was average at best. The soup could have literally been Campbell's. I have tasted a lot of soups in my lifetime, but this one was not up to par. It was pretty much all cream, a little tomato flavoring and no basil. If it is to be advertised as \"Tomato-Basil Soup\" it SHOULD at least have some basil. Instead of the Cornish Game hen, I decided to go with the Cheese Ravioli. I wasn't exactly thrilled with that either. The sauce was way to sweet, and the ravioli themselves were stuck together, and were really hard. I still ate all of it, but it is not one of the better dinners I've had. The dessert was also standard. It could have been made by Hostess brand desserts. It tasted exactly like the kind of desserts I can get in my high school's cafeteria (which is disgusting, let me tell you). Overall, I wasn't pleased with the meal, but hey!

I had been to Vegas many times, and brought my husband for the first time, this was something that I had always been interested in seeing so when I saw the deal we got the tickets. The show is very lively! We left high spirited and ready for a fun night. It is also a really good deal with the dinner included. We were full the rest of the night! \n\nWhat I disliked about the show: I thought that it was WAY to short! It could have had a few more scenes in it, maybe a comedy scene, or a bit more to the tournament. The show definitely needs a bit more bulking up, even if only 15 minutes longer. Also, I found the waiters and waitresses very distracting, while watching the show at an already blocked view because the person to my left would not sit back in his chair, the servers would also come around and block views which I found really annoying. I felt like they rushed the service a bit and could have easily not bused the tables until after the show was over. They came to give the food, to bus the food, bring the desert, bus the desert, bring ordered drinks which took forever to get, and then the bill and back for change. it was very distracting! \n\nI would seriously suggest watching this BEFORE you plan on LOVE or any other Cir Du Sole shows, because it will probably be a bit of a letdown if you see Cir first.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "If u haven't been, its definitely something u have to see at least once.

Our gal was really nice and has worked at the show for over 20 years.  We asked her about tips because we were curious what people usually do in this type of setting?  She said some people forget about them after the show or just don't leave anything.  She said that most people do leave something for them.  She pulled a $20 bill out of her pocket and said someone had given her a $20 already and dessert wasn't even out yet.  She was so delighted with her twenty dollar bill.  She was a very sweet lady.  We handed her $40..she said thanks, never looked at it, and tucked it into her pocket.  When she came back around to remove more dishes she took the time to say thank you again for the tip and that she really really really appreciated it.  They do work hard so make sure to bring some tip money with you so you can leave your server a something.  \n\nThe food was surprisingly good and better than expected.  Our group all enjoyed the soup, potatoes and the chicken.  The beverages offered: Sprite, Pepsi, or Diet Pepsi served in a large plastic mug.\n\nThe best things for me were: The horse that marches, our server, and the end of the show.

The Paiza Club is THE quintessential big time player high-roller lounge. I asked another VIP host, as I entered, about some stats. She said that there is a dining room with 34 seats.

I was in a high-roller suite recently and this view of Las Vegas could quite possibly beat it.

Lots of garlic. So good. Possibly better than BWW's spicy garlic.\n\nBeano's Butt Burner - Not nearly as hot as I expected. However, the flavor for this sauce was amazing. Hot, but not tear inducing. Perfect.\n\nChipotle BBQ - Probably our favorite. The combonation of smoky pepper and sweet bbq sauce was awesome.\n\nThe cheese fries were solid.

It's nestled in between a 24-hour taco shop and a storage facility.  It promises video poker jackpots and a friendly atmosphere.  Needless to say it's not overly inviting from the outside - but proximity as well as the opinions of fellow Yelpers finally convinced me to try out this nearby restaurant.\n\nAs with most local bars, you can choose to go into a restaurant portion or the bar portion of the building.  The restaurant is smoke free, and although this location is relatively new, the restaurant interior suggests otherwise.  Everything is clean and in good condition - it just looks much older.\n\nWe went for dinner on Saturday night and there were only a few other patrons seated inside.  There was no hostess stand or any sign directing us to seat ourselves.  The waitress walked by where we were standing, even said hello, but never told us to seat ourselves.  Not a big deal, just a weird interaction.\n\nHaving read the reviews on Yelp I knew what kind of menu to expect.  I knew I wanted a burger and I knew DC was going to get the fish and chips.  We also decided on a pint of EI beer and the sweet potato tots.  The waitress was very pleased with our tots selection and really started raving about them.  When they came out, they were served with plastic tub of syrup - our waitress said the syrup took the tots to a whole different level.\n\nShe was right.  Seriously.  sweet potato tots may hold the key to world peace.  They were hot and sweet and savory all at the same time.  They had the right amount of crunch and were not greasy at all.  These would be great for breakfast, great for kids as a side dish, and definitely great at 3am after having a couple beers at the bar next door.  \n\nDC loved his fish and chips.  Three giant pieces of cod that were seriously fresh.  DC marveled at how good it was, and he was disappointed that he was served more food than he could comfortably fit into his belly.\n\nI ordered the Southwest burger, which was topped with sauteed onions and jalapenos, cheese, and guacamole (also chipotle mayo, but I opted out).  This burger was massive, hot, and delicious.  Mine was cooked a little more well done than I asked for, but I'm not overly picky about that.  The burger had serious spice from the jalapenos, but it was fantastic.\n\nOverall, the food was far better than the exterior of the building suggests.  The price was ridiculously low for what we got.  Our waitress was very friendly, even though a little awkward at times.  \n\nI can't speak to the rest of the Village Pub locations and the quality of their food, but if you're ever down in this part of the Valley, stop in and get some exceptional food at a fantastic price.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "The bartenders are really friendly and the cesser salad was really good.

I had no idea about this new hidden gem in Scottsdale and I will definitely be returning. You start off by going into the butterfly incubation room where you can see butterfly cocoons and butterflies emerging. There was a liaison in the room describing the metamorphosis from caterpillar to butterfly and the different incubation times for different species. It is very interesting to see different types of exotic butterfly cocoons. If you get lucky you can sometimes see one emerging from the cocoon.\n\nWe then made our way into the butterfly rainforest area. This room is air sealed so you may have to wait a few moments so that they ensure that no butterflies escape in the transition of the doors opening. This room is very muggy and warm so be prepared for that. It is probably around 90 degrees at least and they keep it that way for the butterflies. At certain times a mist is released and it cools it down substantially but you will get hot in this area. If you are like me the hot, muggy environment will not distract you from the peaceful tranquility of the butterflies and plants. This was such a relaxing experience for me. I spent about an hour in this room and could have stayed even longer. You can refer to your visitor's guide and try to spot different species of butterflies. There are many flying around and so many great photo opportunities. Definitely bring a camera. There is a big water fountain in the middle of the room and it is a little cooler in this area. The butterflies also love this area and it is a very peaceful place to sit and relax. I did not find it to be crowded at all and this was a holiday weekend.\n\nThe second area that you are able to view after the butterfly rainforest is an exhibit on ants and bees. It is also quite interesting and it is cool to watch the ants burrow and see how they communicate. The bee hive that they have set up is connected to the desert outside and the bees bring back the honey to a see through bee hive. They have facts posted about how the bees collect honey and how they are good for our environment. The last exhibit is a small fresh water aquarium. It is listed in the brochure as an amazon adventure. This is the area of the attraction that is going through growing pains. I think it will be a really cool exhibit once it has been open for a little longer. I did see a couple of dead fish in the tanks but I know that is common when an aquarium is first opening because the tanks have to balance out. They did not have enough information posted about the fish and we were wondering about the species and the area they were indigenous to. They also have a small sting ray pool with very small sting rays. The liaisons were very good about asking if we wanted to touch the sting rays and while we chose not to, many of the little kids were so happy to be able to have that experience. \n\nOverall I had a wonderful time and will definitely be back. This would be a great place to bring kids of any age as well as a great outing for adults. It is very educational and also a peaceful and tranquil environment.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 5, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "My family of 4 (3 and 5 yr old) wanted to love this place, but it was a waste of money!!!  We want our $60 back!! First of all, they claim to have the largest conservatory in America.  Yes, by blueprint this may be true, but when you walk in it does not look like a rainforest in anyway and you only see one or two types of butterflies.  Please make way to Houston's butterfly conservatory (Texas).  That is a real rainforest carrying all kinda of butterflies from around the world.  Also, there was no information to be found on walls about anything you saw.  They give these cards to the children to ask a volunteer for a \"fun fact\" and we only passed 2 volunteers! There was no one available to tell you what you were looking at.  No signage of explanations of any sort.  How is this educational? Please please do not waste your money.  You are better off watching YouTube videos or going to the library for information. Also, they had ants and bees.  Same thing no descriptions.  We walk into this tiny aquarium with maybe 3 fish tanks with 2 fish in them.  We saw one lady who asked if we were going to do some petting.. Um ok and proceeds to give us hand sanitizer. First of all what are we petting?? We put our hands in the water to pet what looks like a stingray??? No signage??!!! No one is there to tell us anything!!! So disappointing.. Again, why is this educational? The fish in the tank has a white piece of paper on the wall that looked like they had just printed it earlier that morning with the name of the fish.  That's it!! No other information about where the fish is from.. Nothing.  My husband made a comment.. Hey we eat that fish.  You can get that at the Asian market.

When you enter, you have the choice of seeing the 3D movie or moving onward to the next room. The movie is around 15 minutes, and shows off the 3D views and pretty imagery rather than a lot of informative discussion about the monarch butterfly.\n\nAfter the movie, you enter a room that showcases the different pupae that are in the process of transforming into a butterfly. Since there was a large crowd when we went, there was a little bit of a wait for patrons in the actual conservatory to exit before more could enter.\n\nThe actual conservatory is a photography student's dream. The landscape is a bit ethereal as various butterflies flutter by you. Some may even land on you for a quick second before taking off again. Although we did have a guide to the different species of butterflies in our brochure, there wasn't much else in terms of education about the different butterflies.\n\nThe next section after the conservatory shows a honeybee colony and several ant colonies. The ant colonies in agar were lighted up with neon, making it look like the ants were having a rave. It was cool to see the honeybees, with the queen marked with a green dot to differentiate her from the other bees.\n\nThere is also a set of nice aquariums, and a touch pool with stingrays. The aquarium was a weird addition to a butterfly conservatory I thought. The fish were all freshwater common species you could find at your nearest Petsmart (e.g., African cichlids, various gourami, neon tetras). There were a few signs listing the species, but not all the aquariums were labeled. Like the butterfly section, the stingray and fish section didn't have a lot of educational information in them. \n\nIt took us about an hour to browse through everything. The experience here is nice, but it's more of a visual experience rather than a learning one. Some things that might be good for the exhibits are more information about butterfly conservation, why the different species of butterflies are differently colored, and how different cultures view butterflies. Since there are so many children that visit the conservatory, it would be nice for them to be enticed to learn about nature in addition to the visual interactive beauty of the butterflies.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 6, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "Anxious to see this new addition and knowing it was being marketed as the largest in the US., my family went on the second day it was open.

Overall, we enjoyed the experience but it was not worth the money, especially when both the Phoenix Zoo and Desert Botanical Garden are a 15 minute drive away, both are cheaper, larger, provide much more to see and do for a longer period of time, and DBG has it's own Spring Butterfly Exhibit.\n\nOur son enjoyed the 3D movie, and throughout our entire visit, was the most educational aspect provided - although it centered around Monarch butterflies and their migration only.  The Chrysalis Lab, which you visit next, was the highlight of the visit.  However, there was absolutely no information provided aside from the paper tags identifying the types of butterflies in each type of cocoon.  Because you visit this area directly after the movie and the entire theater is emptied directly into this room, you really only have the length of the next movie to enjoy yourself before being crowded in upon by the next incoming group.  Due to my family being at the back of our theater, by the time the room cleared out enough to give us a good view of the cocoons, we had about 5 minutes or so and then were swarmed by the next large group of people anxious to get a look and were crowded out.\n\nThe atrium itself was alright, but disappointing for what was being boasted about it.  It was hot and humid, as to be expected, and the vegetation has a lot of growing to do before it can even be considered as rainforest-y.  The butterfly guide provided when admission was paid was both lacking quite a few species which were spotted, and listed a handful which weren't identified anywhere.  Aside from the few guides answering questions for children and marking their punch cards (they received a prize at the end for having a completed punch card), there was absolutely no information, signage, etc. provided anywhere...which was disappointing.\n\nThe ant colony and bee exhibit were alright, but have potential to be much better.  There were a few native AZ species in a corner that looked like they were thrown in as an afterthought and were out of place.  The fish seemed as an odd addition, and were nothing spectacular.  All very common species of fish found at any chain pet store and in the center of the room was a touch tank with 4 very small stingray laying on the bottom of the pool.  Only one came up on occasion, and the moment it was touched, went straight back down to the bottom.  Not faulting the stingray and wanting to be left alone, but a lot more could be done with that exhibit if they want to make it memorable in any way.\n\nOverall, a once-a-year-if-that sort of place unless you REALLY like butterflies.  It was expensive, and didn't provide enough for more than 1 1/2 to 2 hours of entertainment in its entirety.  Other valley organizations are cheaper, and have a lot more to offer.

But the experience overall was extremely underwhelming and I will tell you why.\n\nFirst, the good. The Butterfly Exhibit in Boston is much smaller than this place. It's actually more like a closet than anything. So the good news is that Scottsdale's exhibit beats Boston's by several factors.\n\nNow, the bad. I went to the Butterfly Exhibit in Xcaret last year and it was FOUR times bigger than Scottsdale's. Butterfly Wonderland measures ten thousand square feet...Xcaret is forty-thousand and is two full levels. \n\nNow back to Butterfly Wonderland: After paying the fee ($$$!) you go down a hallway showing meager butterfly art. Then you're led into the theater, where you see a brief 3-D movie on Monarch Butterflies. Nice movie. It's definitely geared for kids, so it's very streamlined and the language of the movie is oh-so-easy to understand...but the sheer simplicity of the movie means that lots of information gets weeded out. I am an information geek. Cram my cranium with it! I can take it. Even as a child, I could. All that information would entice me to buy books, research, maybe even plant my own butterfly garden so that I can be a part of the action...\n\nSo all too soon, the movie ends. And you are led to the Butterfly Atrium. The atrium itself is very nice, and it should be, since it is brand new. Thousands of butterflies abound! In the air, clustered around flowers, gathering upon each other to get at bowls heaped with cut fruit. \n\nTen thousand feet is ten thousand feet...and all too soon you walk in your little semi-circle and it's over. I walked slowly, took many pictures and some videos, and was still in and out of the \"largest atrium of the Americas\" in less than 12 minutes.\n\nAfter leaving the atrium was a tinny ant exhibit, bee exhibit, scorpion exhibit, and then some aquariums filled with fish you can see at the pet store. The lighting was pretty bad. Many signs were permanently hidden in shadows, making them very difficult to impossible to read. As for the fish and other creatures, the tags just showed their names but no other information. Where do they live? Why are they featured? What do they eat? Are they endangered? These are questions that children and adults ask.\n\nSo, the next stop was a stingray tank, which you can step up to. Being able to touch these magnificent animals is definitely a highlight. However. At the Wildlife World Zoo, you can purchase some food for a buck or two and actually FEED these graceful creatures. \n\nThen there is the obligatory gift shop...for kids. Not too many items that would interest an adult. And remember, I'm just a big kid at heart...so I know that the chinsy toys offered just didn't cut it for me as a child as well. \n\nThe effort that went into this place is tremendous. But it's very small and you can seriously be done with the whole thing in less time than it took to drive here. I know and understand that they have to cater to the mentality of children, but that does not mean you have to dumb yourself down. Challenge children to think! Challenge their geography! Challenge their vocabulary! Teach them to read and write cursive! But I digress.\n\nThis is certainly worth a look. And a look is all you will get. You'll get some very nice pics from the Atrium.

Also, the emergence \"gallery\" was paltry compared to Xcaret's extensive ROOMS of emerging butterflies in all the different stages of development along with the interesting stages of plants used. \n\nThe conservatory has just one circular path that takes about 15 minutes.

It's just enough to be courteous but nothing extraordinary to make you want to come back. Why would a company provide canned responses that say \"I'm sorry for your experience!\" -and love the exclamation point in the end. \n\nFirst I just want to say I have been looking forward to this for awhile. I've been talking about the building when it first came up and the future plans that are yet to come with the aquarium and Ripley's. I really hope this place does not represent what is yet to come.\n\nFirst from the 101 freeway on outside this place looks to be nice and air conditioned. Oh my goodness please don't pay for a gym membership just come here for a sauna!  Yes we came when it was 115 degrees out but are you kidding me everyone was sweating buckets for how hot and humid this place was. I think we stayed in the butterfly area for 15 minutes. 10 of those minutes was close to the back where the \"air\" was. Seriously visit the 6 other months when it's nicer. \n\nWhich leaves me to this conclusion....what is this place thinking?  This is the desert. We Phoenicians love our AC at 75. No one goes out of the house unless there is an opportunity for shelter in an icebox.  \n\nThis place is expensive at $20 a person.  I was willing to pay the price but expected so much more value. I've been to the butterfly habitat in a Six flags in Northern California and I felt like I had a much more enjoyable butterfly experience there than this dedicated place. Let me offer some tips to justify this price tag and bring more people in:\n1. Seriously...board those windows up and get A/C and get rid of that humidity If its not the right climate for the butterflies then you better find some that do.  The other butterfly habitat I was at it was outdoors but was not humid and I believe it was about 80 degrees. You absolutely need to consider this to survive in the desert and for us locals to help spread the word on your establishment. \n\n2.  Your employees better add to the experience than do the bare minimum. Try smiling, interact with the guests...add to the experience and don't just stock items. Those opening closing \"protect the butterfly\" human door guards need to have more personality. That was everyone's first and last experience of this place and it was blah. They need better coaching to bring their A game. \n\n3.  The second half of the exhibit... What the heck is that? Random ant farms from hobby stores and scorpions that look like teens are trying to keep? I mean can you do better than a blacklight flashlight on a chain that doesn't work? Wire up a cheap button to light up a strip black light. \n\n I really hope there are bigger plans for this it just really looked rushed or not well planned out. I think the bees thing was cool but the \"experience\" of it wasn't. It just wasn't presented well.\n\n I love that the bees fly on and out of the building themselves. Yet there was nothing that told me that and it seemed hidden. I have no idea about the fish...I'm assuming they were inexpensive compared to the other fish and so you bought them. \n\n4.  Upkeep. New building and there's paint missing and tape holding up the wall in the bee area? Cheap paper signs telling me to give me my ticket?  Think experience. This is my first impression. You paid thousands of dollars to get those giant butterflies in the ceiling and you go cheap on signs and upkeep?  Cafeteria get an interior designer. It just feels like a high school cafeteria than part of an \"amusement park\". \n\n5.  Make this place more kid friendly. Maybe allow strollers. Nothing like holding a sweaty 97 degree kid next to me so she doesn't squash anything. Have a play area? I don't know we're customers you should know your clientele. This place obviously is to attract young families so think that way. \n\n6.  Get tons more butterflies.\n\nOkay now I'm ranting... If you are considering coming here wait for the fall or winter. I doubt you'll be back until prices are cheaper or if they make the premium price worth it. Just go to say you've gone. \n\nI guess I'll see you in a few years when hopefully you're still here and you've improved.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 4, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Fun place to visit, especially if you have kids!", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Our first experience was back in August.

When you first come into BW you go into a small theater and watch a really cool 3D movie. Probably one of the best 3D movies I have ever seen. The movie is about 15 mins long. From there you go into a room where you can see butterflies at all different stages of coming out of their chrysalis's. Then, from there- into the atrium. Now, this is advertised as \"America's Largest Butterfly Atrium\". Is it really? Eh. I saw a previous review that complained that it was hot and humid in there....duh- it has to be. Come prepared for that. With that said, I wouldnt recommend coming in July/August. But you can walk around the atrium as long as you want and it is truly beautiful to see all the butterflies fluttering around.
