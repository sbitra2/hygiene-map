Even if you just pop in for a glass of wine, you are provided with a small dish of gloriously fat and tasty olives.

I decided to go with four because while I LOVED the food here, it fell down in one or two places.\n\nI went here with my man this past summer, when is was so excruciatingly hot (remember that weekend?) that we spent most of our time laying around complaining, and drinking cold beer.  My guy went for a meal with one of his buddies here a couple of weeks prior and raved about it so much that I forced him to take me one evening when we were able to peel ourselves off the floor.\nHe reported that the beers were quite pricey so we opted for a bottle of white wine.  The white wine selection was pretty limited and not cheap (we ordered the cheapest bottle at something like \u00a315.00), and I regret to say that we were most assuredly not impressed with our choice.  \n\nOur food, however, more than made up for it.  I love tapas because I love variety.  We ordered three or four dishes each and enjoyed every bite.  I would love to go into detail but have a memory like a sieve and can't remember what we ordered off the top of my head.  I would be pretty confident, though, that anything you order here will be grat.    \n\nThe problem with Dionika is that no one ever goes here.  I honestly don't know how they survive.  I have NEVER seen it full.  It's one of those things where people don't go there because it's always empty, but of course it's always empty because no one goes there.  \n\nWe keep wanting to go back but walk by and it's so dead that we decide to go somewhere else.  I think maybe everyone who likes this place need to agree on a night to go there so we can have great food AND good atmosphere!\n\nOne other oddity - at the end of our meal the owner/chef came out and made his chatty round of the dining room (all three tables).  He was very spirited and certainly loves his restaurant.  He was a bit eccentric, but gave us complimentary booze so our hearts were won over.\n\nEdit:  I forgot to mention that the meal (including 15 pounds for a bottle of wine) was 40 pounds.

I've heard, from Emily V., this is common. \n\nIt's bright, warm and fun inside and appears to be more traditionally Spanish than the more main stream \"La Tasca\" and the like.

Especially poor Chris M. who doesn't like chorizo (there's a story behind that one), aubergine, mushrooms, or pretty much anything else we ordered... Ando n a Saturday night, when as previously mentioned, the place was empty. So it seems they just hadn't stocked up or prepped properly.\n\nAnd the food was...so-so. It felt a little 'old' and boring, as if the chef was used to just dolling out the same thing night after night and wasn't particularly passionate about it. Spanish / mediterranean cuisine is one of my all-time favourites, and the raw ingredients are so delicious it's hard to go wrong. But it was a little underwhelming. And a little too greasy / oily/ cheesy / deepfriend. Almost every dish had a layer of visible grease.\n\nIt also took us a while to get our bill. The waiters seemed a little laxidaisacal and uninterested (again, despite that there were more waiters than full tables).\n\nIt felt as though Dionika had a self-conscious awareness at how old, tired and empty it normally is and as such the food, staff, and general atmosphere had lulled.\n\nIt would be nice to bring a family here, or a larger table as we did precisely for the sociable aspect of Spanish food.

Was here on a Friday night and it wasnt too busy, which was perfect because my BF and I were starving. Even better, service was quick! Heres what we had:\n\nApple & Manchego Salad - sliced up pieces of apple and cheese mixed with some green onions and a light dressing. I just love how this one looked and I was kind of surprised by how well everything tasted together.\n\nChicken Salad - pretty much your typical chicken salad served on endive leaves with some bread on the side. It was good, but in comparison to the other things we had, this one wasnt very memorable. But the bread was really tasty!\n\nStuffed Dates - one of our favorites! Dates stuffed with ground up almond and blue cheese wrapped in bacon. You get 5 pieces with this one but youll definitely want more! Im getting hungry just thinking about these!!\n\nStuffed Mushrooms - pretty good overall. I thought they were a bit greasy, but the taste was good. Not exactly sure what the mushrooms were stuffed with though... bread crumbs, bell pepper, and yumminess.\n\nCrispy Duck Roll - another favorite of ours! The duck was so flavorful. The outside is similar to an egg roll. Wasnt too greasy and just filled with duck, no veggies on this one. You also get 4 pieces here. \n\nEggplant Cannelloni - this one seemed a little small compared to our other dishes. The cannelloni's were about the size of my ring finger, but the taste makes up for it. Stuffed with goat cheese and topped with a tomato basil sauce. Cant go wrong with goat cheese!\n\nLamb Skewers - probably one of the bigger dishes. Comes with 2 skewers with 3 pieces of lamb on each. I thought the lamb was a little tough, but wasnt gamy tasting at all. The skewers were served on top of a bed of lentils with tomatoes. I wasnt too thrilled with the lentils. I thought they were just too flat compared to some of the other great flavors we had, but the bf enjoyed it, so maybe its just me.\n\nTheres also a pretty big selection of dessert items, maybe a dozen or so.

First off, my favorite dishes to get are the stuffed dates and the lamb skewers.  With the dates, I know I'm going to get bacon wrapped dates with blue cheese, sitting in a wine reduced sauce.  I thought the sauce was not as sweet as I'm used to and really oily.  For the lamb skewers, I definitely think their temperatures were off. I asked for medium done and got a medium well lamb which meant dry meat.  Also, talk about under seasoned.  A little salt and pepper goes a long way.  We also got the camarone a la diabla, which are pieces of shrimp sitting in a pool of sweet chili sauce.  It was ok, just not the same as the paradise location.  The stuffed mushrooms were dry, chicken salad was good, just didn't offer the same greatness as the original location.  \n\nAs you can tell, I wasn't really thrilled about the food, even though we spent over $200 that day (thank goodness for work meals).

Here is a list of things we got-\n\nStuffed Dates - [bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese] These were highly recommended on Yelp, so I tired them and yummy!!  I loved them. They had a great sweet and savory taste going on. I absolutely loved the crunch of the almond as you bite in to the date. \n\nStuffed Peppers - [Spanish piquillo peppers, fresh mozzarella, garlic cream cheese, tomato sauce] I enjoyed these as well. They had crunchy onion strings on top which add really good texture that the soft pepper and cheese needed. \n\nBaked Tetilla - [roasted tomato and tetilla cheese fondue with chorizo, toasts] This I really would not order again. Just was not my favorite. It had an off taste and the toasts were not toasty, but soggy from being placed in the cheese.\n\nHam & Cheese Croquetas - [serrano ham & manchego cheese] This was one of my favorite items of the night. The breading was light and crunchy and the filling was wonderful. Little bits of ham and melty cheese!! Mmmmm...my mouth waters now just thinking about them!\n\nChicken & Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms - As far as stuffed mushrooms go they were good, but I don't think i'd order them again. Nothing that special about them.\n\nSteak & Mushroom Skewers - [Grilled filet with a roasted garlic cream & red wine reduction] We got these cooked medium rare and oh boy they were so yummy. The steak and mushrooms were cooked perfectly. Dipped in the sauce it was pure heaven on a stick! I'd for sure order these again!\n\nI also had the sparkling sangria. Which was a very reasonable price due to happy hour and very refreshing.\n\nNow for the service and atmosphere part of the evening- I got there around 4:45pm. It seems to be the shift change time cause there was a slew of employees walking by my table clocking into a computer or gathering their stuff and clocking out. The kitchen is open-style, but where my table was, I felt like the three waiters who were waiting for their orders were just standing there staring at me. It made me feel very uncomfortable. I think they should have their employees clocking in and out at some other place and not in clear view of customers. At first the service was fast, but as they got busier, they got slower. It took about 10 minutes to refill my friend's soda and even refill the water. \n\nI had read on their Yelp page that it was not a place for children, yet there were two different couples that brought toddlers and a newborn baby. I feel that the review is correct and that it is not a place for children. I go to a place like this because it is an adult environment. This is not Applebees! I do not want to hear little billy banging his fork over at the next table. If they don't have a kids menu you should not bring your children.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed Firefly!

I can't go up to 4, but it was a good lunch.\n\nThe bread was warm and had a nice compound butter with it.  I don't eat olives, but there were olives as well.  Good bread service, and it was nice to dip in the tomato sauce later in the meal.\n\nThe wife got the tomato soup with the brie grilled cheese.  I don't usually like tomato soup, but I wanted to try it.  The soup needed salt (something a lot of dishes lacked) and the grilled cheese was not grilled enough.  It too was on the bland side.  The adult fish sticks were overly done.  They were either burnt or the recipe calls for them to be fried too long.  Also, the spicy tartar sauce was lacking in heat.\n\nThe shrimp tempura was a winner, although I didn't care for the sauce.  They are large and the tempura breading was good, not ridiculously thick as tempura can be.  Also, it adhered to the shrimp well.  This dish is served with tempura fried green onions and carrots, which were great.\n\nThe meatballs were solid.  The parmesan kind of melts into a blanket on the top, making it difficult to remove one meatball from the dish without taking all the cheese with you.  \n\nThe ham and cheese croquettes were winners.  I will order this dish again, and maybe 2 of it.  Perfectly fried (as opposed to the fish sticks) and a nice tangy sauce.  \n\nThe manchego mac n cheese has been built up.  I've heard about it from several diners.  And, it largely lived up to its reputation.  I liked the peppers on top, they tasted to me like peppadews.

Once upon a time, the menu at Firefly was excellent, and the execution was great.  Service has always been an issue, and it's not any different now.  The Eastern location is actually very nice - great views of the city at night, although if you're not a resident of the Anthem area, it'll be hard to notice and could be considered hard to get to.  Parking is not so great or plentiful as some the Firefly neighbors seem to get a little testy about which spots belong to who.\nIn any case, the ambience is very Firefly - swanky, dark and a little sensual, same as the other locations.  The staff is generally personable, but very slow and somewhat disinterested in your dining experience.  It struck as almost being drive-thru like - they're trying to turn as many tables as possible, which means getting your order to you and you out the door.  \nThe food is still good, although not excellent.  The bacon wrapped dates are more like charcoal wrapped raisins - I recommend a pass on that dish.  The roasted beet salad however is very good albeit very simple.   I've had good days and bad days with the mushroom tart - on a good day it's to die for, on a bad day, the pastry dough tastes like it's been in the freezer six months too long, and the mushroom sauce like it's been in the can too long.  Tha ham and cheese croquettas however, those have been consistently delish.  Those are a must have for me every time I visit.  \nWhich brings me to my last point - this review seems very critical and sound like I'm disappointed in Firefly, and I am, but that's only because it used to be so much better, but it's still good . . .  not great, but good.

So, we made a reservation to celebrate our anniversary tonight, and unfortunately, this location was a real bummer compared to the other one.\n\nWish I'd noticed that a bunch of the reviews on this location appear to be for the Paradise location, not the Anthem location BEFORE we made a reservation. If you're reviewing here, people, this is the Anthem location we're talking about! :)\n\nWe started with the baked tetilla and smoked salmon toasts. The tetilla itself was great, but there was a large quantity of cheese and we only got four small, thin pieces of bread to dip in the cheese. They were also served in the cheese, so all were half-soggy by the time we got them. We made up for the rest by using the bread plate. We had almost finished by the time the waiter returned to ask if we needed more bread.\n\nI had really enjoyed the smoked salmon toasts at the other location, and was so bummed to pick up my first one and find that it was burned black and so dry it was broken in half. One other was this way also (black and broken), and the other two were quite dark but at least they weren't broken. Really dry, though, and I lost out on any flavor that might have been on them. The salmon was tasty and the cream was nice as well, though.\n\nWe tried the Firefly fish with panko and spicy tartar sauce next, and were surprised by how stinky the fish was. I also live inland--even further inland than Nevada, in fact--and I've always found tilapia to be light on the aroma and to typically smell like the sea. Our tilapia was just plain stinky. Very fishy, very strong. Neither Husband nor I finished our fish.\n\nThe mango BBQ ribs were so tender the bones fell out of the meat, and the sauce was good, but we were pretty disenchanted by this point and decided to move on to dessert.\n\nBummer news--dessert wasn't up to snuff either. I'd gotten the dessert platter at the Paradise location and enjoyed everything on it, but we just wanted a bit of dessert, so Husband picked the lemon berry tarts. I knew they'd be tiny-tiny, having had the ones at the other location, but I was downright disappointed when I discovered the tiny tart shells were barely 1/3 full. And, if you've eaten there, you know that means there's probably between 1/2 tsp. and 1 tsp. of filling. The shells only fit about a tablespoon. The lemon filling was absolutely indistinguishable due to the higher proportion of tart crust and fresh berries (which were very sweet and tasty, thank heaven, or the dessert would have been absolutely irredeemable).\n\nService wasn't nearly as good as at the Paradise location, where I felt the waiter worked for my tip and I rewarded him handsomely in return. Here, where they were probably half to a third as busy, our waiter showed up at strange times and there were big lags between one course and the next. He was a perfectly adequate waiter but I knew I could expect better from this restaurant group. Our back waiter and runner were actually better than the waiter himself. They were quick, attentive, and helpful, and worked our table wonderfully.\n\nSo, a $55 meal I didn't enjoy all that much, but at least my belly is full.

I supposed that was enough time to get relatively good service. We entered and were seated within a minute. The dimly lit room, music and paintings that hung along the walls created a hip and inviting atmosphere.\n\nOur table was greeted by the waitress who seemed to be quite kind. We ordered drinks that were all brought to the table within minutes. After a moment or so we ordered the ham and cheese croquets, lamb skewers and veggie empanadas.  \n\nThe croquets arrived first. They were crispy on the outside with a mild hint of ham hidden in this cheesy, potato-enveloped dish. These were followed by char-grilled lamb skewers on a bed of lentils and pimento. The lamb was tasty with that hint of blackened crispness about the edges that make any like dish a favorite for group. Even the lentils on which it rested was a good accompaniment. Our empanadas gave of more of the same. They were seasoned favorably but not too spicy. We thought it all was decent-to-good, but I think our palates wanted something more complex.\n\nAfter a couple of dishes more (baked tetilla and stuffed mushrooms) we realized that the food was all about the same level of quality, and in all likelihood would be much the same. The waitress then approaches our table (one of the smallest groups there) and informs us this would be the last call to order food as they were trying to close early. This was between 9:20-9:30pm. Having arrived a little more than an hour before closing we figured it would not be a long night, but to have someone say that to us seemed a little out of place. That was okay but when the waitress/staff lost track of what we ordered it was disappointing. In what I guess was a push to end their work day, our bacon-wrapped dates and sliders get to our table warm at best. The fried onions on that were served with our sliders were definitely not fresh out of the fryer and the burgers themselves were just \"okay.\"\n\nPerhaps we arrived too late, but the people around us certainly didn't seem concerned with when the establishment would be closing.

We made a reservation on a Friday for a party of 5-6 around 8:30PM without too much trouble the morning of.  We did get a note that it would be tough to make reservations later on at night as it became more popular.  \n\nThe decor is red and a little darker - definitely giving it a more intimate feel.  On the right side of the restaurant is the bar area and seemed much more relaxed than the left side which was a bit more open and had a small area for the band.  On certain days (again, we came on a Friday), there was a live band playing salsa/bossa nova music and even two dancers that really made the area fun to be around and they were fairly responsive to the crowd.  Great touch.  \n\nOne thing you have to get when you come here is the sangria which supposedly is set for a few days before serving.  It's fruity in flavor yet is not overly sweet overbearing.  It's one of the better sangrias I've had in the world and definitely worth a pitcher.  The tapas themselves are also pretty good.  The bacon-covered dates were not too shabby with the sauce taking the limelight.  I also had the spicy beef salad which came with slices of filet mignon and was surprisingly actually spicy.  The included bread also was good and came with an aioli type sauce.  Costs range from $5-15 and are mostly tapas style dishes although there are a few bigger dishes like paella if you're interested.  We also had the tres leche chocolate cake which was interesting.  Although it wasn't exactly mouth-watering, the concept was interesting and made for a nice cleanse after a much more salty meal.  \n\nOne small unfortunate part of the experience was that the service was a little slow.  There was only one waiter on our side that probably didn't help the situation as the restaurant got more crowded.

Curtido is thinly sliced cabbage, carrots and onions.. that's been pickled of some sort.

Please let me start by saying don't be fooled by the name thinking you may get some spice in your meal when visiting this establishment. I would like to enlighten any potential consumers on the epic failure of the evening I just experienced. Failure number one, they had our reservation incorrect and multiple times mentioning that we had made the reservation incorrectly. Failure number two, your menu on-line does not match your actual menu. When you say you have Hatch green chili on the menu make sure you can actually serve it. Multiple times I asked about the spice and was told it was very spicy, and was disappointed at the lack there of. I am a lover of New Mexico green chili, so if you compare your food to it you shouldn't be light years off on the descriptions.\n\nThird failure of the night was dumping a full ice cold drink down the side of my leg and back of my pants. Not only was I upset at the fact you soaked my jeans, but then offended at the idea the server was going to get a blow dryer and dry off my pants. If I wanted to wear my jeans straight out of the washing machine, I would have done so but thank you to the service staff, they took liberty of doing that for me. So, you want me to take off my pants to blow dry them you say, failure number four. \n\nEpic failure number five was the sub-par meals that followed along with the \"flaming\" drink that is not worth ordering The food was by far the worst thing of the night, which compared to everything else would seem like nothing. If you think you are going to get food, turn around and go back home and eat a bean burrito.  \n\nAfter all that we attempted to salvage the evening with some humor, but then comes failure number six. When the bill arrives we were told that although the server dumped a drink all over me, nothing could be done to adjust the bill. It was just a little liquid as I was reminded by the server AND the manager. I wasn't looking to make a scene but when I stood up from the table, someone asked me if I had an \"accident\" (I'm 29 and housebroken). Even to this point, I was just annoyed. \n\nThis brings us to failure number 7, when paying for the bill we presented our overly intelligent server a $50 visa card and asked her to run the card for that amount, and came back letting us know it was declined. In surprise, I look up the account information on my phone to only see of the $50 loaded on the card the previous day a $48 charge was in the transaction history for Fire and Spice. When we asked the server, she responded by asking if we had ever stayed in a hotel before and how there is an \"incidental\" charge which is why the card didn't go through. I asked for the manager at this point, who felt it was okay to tell me again that the bill was now being discounted because of the small spill on me. So after showing him the charge on-line he then got his second level manager. \n\nOh boy, if you are in the mood for being told you are an idiot, this is the guy to talk to! Failure number 8. When you walk into a customer service situation as the second level manager in an issue, normally one would look to diffuse the situation and not escalate it. Not this guy, he enjoys full confrontation with customers. Not to mention he also witnessed the events of the night unfold and rather than offering to make the situation better, he chose the much higher route of saying that clearly our card was declined because there wasn't enough money on it even after seeing the transaction history of the card, with their establishment as the only charge. Nothing he said made sense and walked away as if we bothered him by asking for an explanation of the charge. \n\nSo here's to you manager's of Fire and Spice at the Sheraton Hotel in Tempe, AZ.. keeping it classy and bringing in customers to make them feel warm a fuzzy inside.

We had dinner at 9:30pm so was not too much traffic but there was an entertainer convention going on, so was very noisy and then when they had an intermisssion we got to see some interesting looking people. It was a lil bit of some nice entertainment. I could see how that could be annoying with all the background noise. First off we started with some cocktails, I had the orange margarita with sugar on the rim, was delicious, and Javier had the house special Fire and spice, it tasted just like a classic margarita (nothing special). Appetizer: we shared the Gambas al fuego. So for $10.00 you get 4 shrimps, (they were delicious) but for $10.00 I expect a lil bit more food. It wasn't even the jumbo shrimp, just normal size. Besides the price and quantity, this dish was delicious. It had a mango salsa that was sooooo good. It had jicama, mango, red bell pepper, cilantro, chile and lime. I think i will try to recreate this at home. So Im glad this is the appetizer we chose, but I will not be getting it again just because of the portion. On a side note, they give you a basket of bread, which is actually soft pretzel sticks. and you get 3 condiments to dip it into.Oil (which I think needed some spices for more flavor), jalepno jelly (ya I know, but surprisingly good), and a sweet/nutty butter.  For the main course: I got the chorizo chicken (chicken stuffed with chorizo and cheese) with a chipotle sauce on top, it came wth ranchero beans( i didnt like these, but thats just my preference, I enjoy more authentic tasting beans) and jalepeno cheese rice, (this was very good, and the cheese dishes are made with white cheddar). Javier had the bbq short ribs (he loved these) and came with jalepeno mac n cheese( this was extra cheesey) , but very good. And finally I ordered dessert, creme brulee. Now I may not be the person to ask because this is my all time favorite dessert, but I have definaltly had better. There was nothing special to it. But I couldnt leave with out trying it.

I love tapas and the menu looked so promising...carpaccio with truffle oil, grilled octopus with a red wine reduction, and chorizo clams in a white wine broth.  My mouth waters just thinking about these dishes and many more on Barcelona's menu, but I'm sad to report that this was one of the most disappointing restaurants I've ever been to!\n\nIt just so happens that I recently acquired a coupon to this restaurant and went to it last Friday.  I just want to make it clear that I would have happily tried this place at full price, and the dish I was looking most forward to trying was the carpaccio (you just can't go wrong with raw beef and truffle oil...I'd hope).  My boyfriend and I were seated and greeted promptly.  When the server came over to take our drink order, he looked down at my coupon, took it and went straight to the kitchen.  Being a server for a long time, I could tell he was not happy that we brought this coupon, but I tried to remedy the situation by being extremely nice.  We ordered the carpaccio, pan fried dates, steamed clams, diabla shrimp, grilled octopus, saut\u00e9ed tilapia, albondigas, and merguez.  After a short while the tapas started coming out, and after delivering the first wave, our server said, \"I'm sorry, but the carpaccio is very popular and we are running out of it tonight.\"  I smiled and said disappointed, \"oh really?\" and he responded, \"yes.\"  Both my boyfriend and I picked up on his wording, but we did not confront him about it.  It is my strong belief that they had enough carpaccio for AT LEAST another order, but they didn't want to waste it on a table with a coupon!  As the night progressed our server grew increasingly more impatient and annoyed with our presence.  When we got our check he had manually written in an 18% tip...on a table for 2, and I always automatically tip 20% (even when the service is bad)!  With a coupon or something comped, I usually tip much more because that's what fellow service industry workers do...(can you tell how livid I am?)  Unfortunately, I wish I could say that only the service was sub par, but the food ranged from ok to not even edible.\n\nPan Fried Dates- This was the best dish we had from Barcelona.  The bacon was cooked well, all of the textures were spot on, and they had a nice savory sweet taste.  However, the red wine reduction was way too thin, the blue cheese crumbles were on the stingy side, and Firefly's are much better.\n\nSteamed Clams- The clams were cooked well, but the chorizo was very dry.  The broth also needed more seasoning (this is a common theme).\n\nDiabla Shrimp- I liked this, but again, it was not as good as Firefly's.  A nice spicy sweet sauce with shrimp, but the sauce was a little too thin.\n\nGrilled Octopus- This just lacked seasoning.  The octopus was a pretty good texture, not too chewy, but the flavor was bland.  For good grilled octopus, try Olives in the Bellagio.\n\nSauteed Tilapia- Completely inedible!  I'm not sure if the kitchen just didn't care or if they genuinely made a mistake, but the outside of the fish was mushy and the inside was raw.  I've never seen fish this texture before, and I honestly can't think of how it happened.\n\nAlbondigas- Meatballs in marinara with melted mozzarella on top.  These were so dry we drenched each bite in the marinara.\n\nMerguez- A spicy lamb sausage served over roasted red pepper couscous.  The sausage was dry and not very spicy.  The couscous was a little wet, but it had a good flavor.\n\nThe one good thing about our experience was that the man refilling our drinks was extremely friendly!  He never let a drink go empty and explained they have live music some nights.

There aren't that many options for tapas in Las Vegas beyond the two Firefly locations.\n\nBarcelona Tapas and Bar gives us one other place to consider when you're craving small bites.\n\nLocated in a busy strip mall where locals frequent, this restaurant had a few customers by the bar and dining when we walked in on a weekday night.\n\nI had a few things in mind immediately based on previous yelpers, so we got to ordering.  We munched on complimentary bread and spreads while we waited for our orders to arrive.\n\n* Beef Carpaccio \"Thin sliced of tender tails drizzle with balsamic vinaigrette, truffle oil, tapenade, and fried onions\" ($8) - I love beef carpaccio...when it's done right.  Yelpers raved about their version and sadly, we couldn't quite see why.  It's more like cured beef than raw beef, which is what we were expecting.  Not quite like beef jerky, but not delicate like what we're familiar with.  It was also covered with large shavings of cheese, which was not mentioned.   Not sure if this was to cover up the beef or enhance the taste.\n\n* Pastelillos de pollo (Chicken Cakes) \"Chopped chicken, green and red onions, red pepper, chopped cilantro, black bean and corn salsa molded together and grilled served with gribiche.\" ($5.50) - Something a bit unusual that you don't see on every menu.  It's a bit misleading in its description since we were expecting all the ingredients to be 'molded together' to create a corn cake.  In actuality, the black bean and corn salsa are on the side of the corn cake.  Nonetheless, it was quite tasty with the accompanying egg sauce.  And it is only one corn cake.\n\n* Merguez Lamb Sausage \"Served with couscous, and roasted pepper tomato sauce and a Merlot wine reduction sauce.\" ($7.50) - There was a distinctive lamb taste to it, and what I'm sure was some liver blended into the mixture.  The Husband isn't a fan of most livers so he was very aware of the funny taste to it.  Comes two in an order.\n\n* Pan Fried Dates \"Pitted dates stuffed with almonds wrapped in bacon with merlot reduction and sprinkled with blue cheese crumbles.\" ($5.50) - Anything wrapped in bacon usually can't go wrong, and dates mix perfectly with bacon in this case too.  Comes five in an order.\n\n* Boquerones (White Anchovies) \"Toasted French bread with a spicy aioli topped with sweet white anchovies and balsamic reduction sauce.\" ($5.50) - Anchovies were something we enjoyed everyday when we were in Spain, but we didn't know what took so long for this one order to come out.  The bread could have been toasted just a bit longer.  \n\n* Lomo a la parrilla (Petite Filet) \"Mashed potato, mushroom and Merlot sauce.\" ($8.50) - Our final order, which we put in at the last minute.  It took a bit too long, and the waiter did come by to say it was coming out soon.  (It still took longer after that.  I can only assume that our order got stuck behind the larger parties that had come in after us.)  Another one of those dishes I ordered based on raving reviews, and sadly, it did disappoint.  We ordered it rare and although the center was pink, the outside was grilled a bit too long and thus hard.  \n\nWe were impressed by how busy it got for a weekday night - and Barcelona Tapas & Bar does cater to families with plenty of large tables, high chairs, and a diaper changing station in the restroom.  Right now they are offering an introductory and temporary offer where kids eat free on Sundays through Tuesdays from 4 pm to 8 pm, for those 10 and under only and with a purchase of an adult entree.\n\nService was okay - we asked our waitress for another set of silverware and she completely forgot about it.  (Immediately after we asked her, she went to sit a  party that arrived and never came back.)  We also had to ask for our beverages to be refilled.  The man who sat us did ask us how we had heard about them.  We also noticed the chef come by our table four different times to look at what we were eating, but never actually said anything to us.  \n\nSpecials include:\nMondays: Half off bottles of wine.\nTuesdays: Half off their homemade Sangria.\nWednesdays: Half off Martinis.\nThursdays: Half off Mojitos.\nFridays: Half off all their tapas from 4 pm to 6 pm\nSaturdays: Ladies Night with Half off all House drinks, wines and beer from 10 pm to 12 am.

Of course, I always say you can't ruin a burger that much when they are so simple. \n\nAbodingos (sp?) AKA Meatballs - Tasty little guys come in a marinara like sauce with lots of cheese. \n\nEmpanadas - There are two types to choose from. I had the chicken, but the alternative is Pork. Chicken was chosen because my friend doesn't eat pork. However, the chicken empanadas were excellent.\n\nFruit Parfait - The parfait was sweet and tasty. Raspberry, Strawberry and blueberries, with whip cream and a sweet yogurt like mixture. \n\nSangria - Thursday night is 1/2 off Sangria night. This means it's $3 per glass. Not too shabby and a good sized glass too. \n\nAtmosphere:\nI have mixed feelings on the atmosphere. Walls were great, but the tables were a bit small for me and I am only 6'2\". My knees hit the top of the tables. However, there were booths that looked like they had more room. It was a Lakers game night so it was rowdy because we were the only Lakers fans in the place. Every else was for Boston. :-( \n\nService:\nFood was fast, and service was excellent. It was more personal then most places.

He got our drink orders in before we even had to open the menus. Throughout our meal, we had servers constantly checking in on us, refilling water, etc. So, for us, the service was super.\n\nThe food? Pretty good in general. The patatas bravas were tasty, though could have been a hair spicier. The tortilla espanola was very satisfying, a thick, fluffy omelet that -- I hate to compare -- puts Firefly's to shame. I assume my girl enjoyed her manchego mac & cheese, because she ate it all. Even the toasted bread served with the meal (accompanied by a garbanzo bean dip and garlic cheese butter) was good. \n\nThe only thing that was not awesome was the tuna tartare.

Not too sweet, not too strong, a good mix of wine and fruit. Someone else here thought it was too sweet. Maybe they had the white?

It tasted good then but almost anything is good after \"drinking\".\n\nThe second time I was here I was with someone who did not eat certain foods and I was kinda full to begin with.

(just an observation)  My son had to get our menus since no one was really helping us. \n\nSo on the quickness for your reading...\n\nWaiter- not very talkative, ok for attentiveness, easy on the eyes but not warm.\nAtmosphere- the walls were black and ok \"so-called Spanish\" decorations.

But at least the tentacles were there.  \n*Son's Sliders- he was sad there was no cheese (LOL).  My son was not too happy and said he'd rather have McDo's.  So I had to take a bite since most kids would rather have McDo's.  The burger was dry and tasted like ground beef with the Lipton Onion Soup Mix.  He actually said he'd rather have home-made burgers.  hahahhaha\nand the french fries that came with it...he said it's like those fries you get in a can....bwahahahaha.\n*Some sliced Steak thingy with mashed potatoes.  It was not hard and chewy but it was very salty.  \nMy son even tried to dip his dry-ass burger in the sauce of the steak...but  it did not help. \n***White Sangria-tasted just like cheap white wine with diced apple in it.

Crispy outside, and really cheesy/potatoey goodness on the inside.\n\nAfter ordering all of this, and devouring it cause it was amazing, our server sent out a complimentary chicken cake :) \n\nOh, and it was national chocolate cake day, so I decided to get to Chocolate Tres Leches, and it was rich and sweet, and just what I needed to end dinner with.

He was funny, engaging, and (most importantly) very attentive! \n\nFirst, and most importantly: the drinks were deceiving delicious in the sense that they were so tasty that I inhaled three glasses without hesitation only to find that I was pretty ridiculously drunk. The red sangria (arguably the only true sangria) was refreshing and light without being overly sweet or disrespectful to the essence of sangria. We had two pitchers. We also had a pitcher of mojito, which was just as refreshing and tasty (though I favored the sangria). For kicks, I tried a glass of white sangria to Marco's and my husband's chagrin, and while it was delicious, it was nowhere near as awesome as the red (which I refused to admit until now). \n\nSecond most importantly: the food. Delicious. I read a few reviews prior to visiting and was worried about the menu until I realized that the issues were mostly with the marinara sauce dishes and I had no interest in them to begin with. Worries gone! \n\nAnyway, the food was fantastic. We actually viewed the menu ahead of time and wrote out a list of the items we wanted to eat (for a group of 5).

Both were such a great start, but that butter was lardy crack, I swear! I wanted to spread it on everything and make the world a happier place with it. \n\n- Calamari: Good portion and tasty sauce. I'm partial to the battered calamari over the breaded variety so I was a happy camper. \n\n- Tortilla Espanola: I know it's just egg and potato, but it's really easy to eff this up. I think it was cooked perfectly (and it got \"pretty close\" remarks from my husband, the guy who thinks all tapas places not in Spain can't get it right).\n\n- Chicken and Mushroom Soup: Not my call. Soup with sangria? What kind of nut orders that? My sister, that's who. But the soup was good!\n\n- Bacon-Wrapped Dates: Standard fare done well here. We got seconds. \n\n- Manchego Mac and Cheese: I swoon for cheesy goodness and everyone gobbled theirs up, but I couldn't get seconds because everyone else does not have the same dairy love that I do. \n\n- Patatas Bravas: Okay, you know how when you eat out and something's supposed to be spicy but, usually, it really isn't? That is not the case. I love heat, but even I caught myself saying, \"WOO!\" and gulping down sangria. We for sure got seconds!\n\n- Escargot: The sauce, the snails, the veggies... they were soppingly good. The toasted bread was the perfect accompaniment and we all found ourselves wiping the plate clean so as to not waste that delectable sauce. Seconds? Yes!\n\n- Beef Carpaccio: It was dressed so well with the fried onions, balsamic sauce, and cheese. Hell yeah we got seconds! \n\n- Garlic Shrimp: We got seconds, first, because it only comes in a set of three and we had five people. Secondly, garlic butter sauce, man! \n\n- Petit Filet: It was like a mini meal of perfectly cooked steak and mashed potatoes. We got seconds. \n\n- Chocolate Tres Leches: I WANTED to get seconds! \n\n- Bananas Foster: Thank you, Marco, for this treat!

I am not the type of person that goes to a happy hour to save money, instead I order twice what I normally would and have it even out in the end.\n\nThe fantastic dishes: \nChilled orzo salad- The orzo was cooked al dente with a nice bite and the grilled veggies were very flavorful. \nBeef carpaccio- This was a generous portion of thinly sliced raw beef. The parm, fried onion strings, balsamic vinaigrette, and tapanade mingled well. Place on on the bread and you have a good contrast in textures.\nStuffed peppers- The creaminess of the three cheese blend with a corn and black bean salad was mellow compared to the other strong tastes.\nBananas foster crepe- The crepe was more crisp than normal, but was perfect with the softness of the caramelized bananas and ice cream.\n\nThe good:\nStuffed dates wrapped in bacon. These were pretty standard.\nFried goat cheese- The balsamic vinegar and honey that line the dish made it delicious, but very decadent.\nSummer bean salad- good but took the dressing from the goat cheese to make it better.\nStrawberries tossed in a balsamic vinegar and cream with a sugar crust. Was decent, the balsamic did not play a prominent part in the dish.\n\nThe bad:\nTuna tartar- I love raw tuna in any form, but my friend said it all when she said it looked like cat food. It was bland on top of looking less than appetizing. \nFried tres leches a la mode- Tasted and had the texture of fried chicken. Not the most appealing of the desserts.\n\nThe desserts are not part of the tapas deal for happy hour. The only one I would pay full price for is the bananas foster crepe.

All of the booths in the restaurant section were full, so my wife and I grabbed a booth like table in the bar as noone was there and it seemed the best choice at the time. It turns out we should have picked a different table as my seat looked right into the kitchen, boxes of soda, the co2 tanks, some dude sitting on a box on his break.  The opening to the kitchen does have some black curtains but they weren't using them and had them tucked back presumably because it was annoying for the workers to walk thru them.  I'm guessing the decorator or owner put those curtains there for a reason, would be nice to see them used.\n\nThe menu prices and drinks are all reasonably priced, so no complaints there. They have lots of coupons available including a discount on Yelp, as well as a 3 hour happy hour with most dishes 50% off so if you time it right you get a big bang for you buck.\n\nI ordered the Grilled Octupus and Shrimp Ceviche to get started with while we looked at the rest of the menu for other stuff.   5 minutes later, the Waitress returns with a \"I'm sorry we don't have any Grilled Octopus or the Shrimp Ceviche tonight\". I'm mildly irritated at this point as:\n\na.) these are two of my favorite items\nb.) I hate it when waitresses don't tell you what they are out of when you sit down.\n\nok, granted they may be out of Octopus because it is not fresh, etc but they do have plenty of other shrimp dishes on the menu so regarding the shrimp ceviche I think it was more of poor planning or lack of desire to make more.\n\nI asked if there were any more items that they didn't have, and the waitress scampered off to the kitchen again to ask (is it really that hard to know what items you aren't serving tonight???) She mentioned two other items they didn't have one of which was another dish I was interested in, big sigh :(\n\nThe food was quite good. My only real complaint was the lack of product knowledge from the waitress. We asked a couple of basic questions like what kind of cheese is on this? etc only to get a blank stare with her picking up the menu to look :)\n\nIt's also milldy irritating when they just drop off the food without a brief explanation.  This is XXX, this is YYY.  My wife and I had ordered escargot and they just dumped it off, we thought it was another dish we had ordered because the escargot was prepared in a method we weren't used to (it was good, but would have been nice to know we were eating it :) )\n\nWaitress made two more mistakes regarding the check.  a.) didn't deduct the value of the coupon even though I gave it to her when we sat down, when she adjusted the bill, she gave me the wrong change and I had to point out her mistake to her. Not the end of the world, but I enjoy my evenings out without having to go through small hassles.\n\nOverall, I would give the food a solid 3.5 stars, and the service about a 2.  \n\nI will give this restaurant another try when I'm in the area.

My favorites are the bacon wrapped dates, the albondigas, the empanadas,  the chicken skewers, and the stuffed mushrooms are very good!

At a busy Tapas place like Firefly(although it's super fun for a party) you don't get the personal experience. Also they have live music sometimes which is AWESOME! Spanish style guitar, so romantic!\n\nLarge Group Dining:\nLast year I had my birthday dinner here. The restaurant handled the additional 30 people on a busy Saturday night with calm and provided the best service. Everyone got everything they ordered and in a timely manner.

We were seated immediately and ordered the vegetable empanadas, the fried goat cheese, the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, the stuffed artichokes and the fried ravioli. All of them were really good. If I had to choose a least favorite, it would probably be the stuffed artichokes. The waiter was extremely nice and seemed very easy going.

My husband asked the weight, again don't remember if they said 12 or 16 ounces. It was so shady and sneaky, it couldn't be more than 4 and a half ounces! The shady part is this, it was cut very very thin and at a strange angle. It looked like perhaps the rest of this tiny piece of meat was under the mashed potatoes it was served with. My husband lifted up the potatoes and there was nothing there! They cut it slanted and made it appear that the rest of the meat was under the potatoes. If we didn't look, we couldn't prove that this was not the size that said. So sneaky, so much lack of respect for their customers, not to mention we were regulars! Our server was so embarrassed and apologetic. On the top of it it was Father's Day! He was so upset he did not order anything else or has yet to return. My dumb ass have given them so many more chances and wasted to much meals there. My wonderful drinks by Melissa kept me going for their mediocre food, but not since this past Saturday, February 8th, was my meal so horrible! Stuffed mushrooms tasteless, served cold in the middle and just a funny texture. My 7 year old said Barcelona Tapas made her hate mushrooms! She said the best thing was the sprite. The ribs although very tender and fell off the bone outrageously sweet, it was a pile of meat and bones and pieces of bone mixed in the meat.  We ordered a filet, which was not a filet, it was chewy, had weird bristle and we  ordered medium rare, it was medium well. So 10 dollars for crap!

If you had the chance to go to La Madonna, the previous restaurant owned by the chef of Mundo, you have probably tasted and enjoyed a similar version.\n\nI had the chicken tortilla soup, which I have ordered before, because it has an incredibly flavored broth that really sets it apart from other chicken tortilla soups I've had. It is seasoned with epazote which helps to give the soup a rich full-bodied taste is responsible for the deep red hue. Ian had the short rib tamale which was also delicious. The tamale dough wasn't dried out as it sometimes can be and the sweet bits of corn gave it a nice texture. The shortribs that were busting out of the husk made for a lovely presentation. \n\nOn another night we started with the queso fundido ($12), which was a combination of four melted cheeses garnished with oven roasted cherry tomatoes, sauteed mushrooms, and a serrano chile drizzle, and served with tortillas. I loved the use of goat cheese, the mushrooms were cooked very well, and the spicy \"drizzle\" complimented the cheese nicely. It's a heart stopper of a dish so we didn't finish it and instead opted to save room for our entree, which was a fantastic idea. We split the filet mignon of Korobuta pork with ancho chile mango glaze and chose sauteed spinach for our side ($26). Though I think it's a stretch to use the words filet mignon to describe pork tenderloin, we both thought the dish was incredibly successful. The ancho rub on the outside of the perfectly cooked pork was wonderfully intense and the accompanying sauces really set it over the top. The mango relish on top was a fantastic sweet addition that cooled the pallet from the heat. Additionally, it was a huge portion so definitely worth the price. We thought maybe they super-sized it for us since go there frequently and have unabashedly expressed our opinions to the staff on each trip (some of which could have been taken as insults but were meant to be helpful pointers since we want the restaurant to succeed), but the waiter confirmed this is the amount everyone gets.

The service sucks.\n\nFirst, I came here for dinner and drinks with my husband.  The restaurant looked pretty empty but they sat us next to a service station with a wastepaper basket.  The servers tossed trash past our heads into the trash can until I glared at them enough and they got the hint.  Still, it's not rocket science people. \n\nBut the shrimp Diablo and sea scallops were excellent.  Perfectly yummy.\n\nMore recently, I came here for lunch with a friend.  It was packed and you needed a reservation to sit at a table for lunch.  We ended up sitting at the bar and waiting forever for service.  The bartender handed us menus and then proceeded to run around like a chicken with his head cut off.  He just could not multi-task.  For example, if someone needed a drink refill that was his one and only focus.  He couldn't deal with more than one drink refill at a time, much less any other tasks.  It was painful to watch.\n\nSome people sat next to us and they knew the drill.  When the bartender tried to hand them menus, they refused and rattled off what they wanted before he could get away.  When we tried to order from him after they did, the bartender wasn't having it.  Apparently he could only handle one task at once.  When we finally got him to take our order, he complained to us like it was our fault.  He said, and I quote, \"It's not like I'm just hanging out back here.\"  Ok.  We had to remind him to bring our drink orders and had doubts that he even put our lunch order in.  It was horrendous.\n\nBy the time we got our food, my friend was starving.  She ordered the tortilla soup without cheese because she can't have cheese.  But it came with it anyway.  She had some and then focused on her cheese-free salad.  We knew we'd be there for another hour if we tried to resolve the soup issue, so we just let it go.  I hope she didn't get sick.\n\nBut once again, the food was excellent.  I had the chicken tostada salad which is deconstructed - not exactly what I expected. At first I thought they gave me the wrong thing. But it was really good. It comes with a whole chicken breast and then the tostada off to the side.  The chicken was nice and juicy.  It comes with a great, spicy sauce.  The tostada was crisp with the right amount of beans, salsa, guacamole, cheese, and crema.\n\nThe design of this place is just stupid.  A large chunk of the middle of the bar is taken up by a pile of ice with tequila in it.  Why I have no idea.  And they used to have tables across from the bar but they took those out to put in couches and ottomans.  All this makes no sense to me.  It's not like people are going to the World Market Center to go clubbing.  Yet they are designing it like a club for some reason.  But the restaurant could use more seating, especially during lunch.  They should bring out the couches and weird ice thing on the bar during dinner when it's dead if they think it's so brilliant.\n\nThey do not have the staff to handle the occasional demand for this place.  Plus, the staff I've encountered lack basic common sense. It's disappointing because the food is really well-executed.  Maybe takeout?  I have to give it an A-OK because I love the food.

For the ladies the waiter would place the napkin on the ladies lap and all that fancy jazz.  While i can learn to love the feeling i know the ladies felt funny about it knowing we were feeling underdressed.  They were very prompt on refilling drinks and making sure we were very comfy.\n\nFood was delicious.  I ordered the shrimp diablo.  It was filling, packed with flavor and heat (as something with the word diablo in the name should!)   The rice it was served with i felt accompanied the dish very well. My friend ordered the Sea scallops with the mango relish and was in love with that as well.  We all felt full but not quite full where we were uncomfortable.

After days of anticipation my wife and I finally had a date for my birthday - just the two of us. \n\nWe were sat at a table for two next to a pillar by the bar. The first thing I noticed was that my fork on the table was filthy. It looked as though someone had dipped it into melted cheese, took a lick and decided it was too hot to eat so they left it to cool down on the table. EEWW. Strike ONE!!! \n\nOur server finally came after waiting almost 10 minutes, and asked if we wanted something to drink. Before we ordered our drinks, I asked if he was the server we had requested on our reservation. He replied with a stiff 'NO\" and told me the server we were looking for had the day off, OK I thought, no big deal. We were just told to ask for that server because he was a friend of a friend. \n\nWhile looking through the menu, my wife asked if any of the entrees were not spicy. He replied, \"This is a Mexican restaurant, everything will have some spiciness to it.\" OK, not the response my wife and I were expecting. Strike TWO!!! We finally ordered our food on his suggestion that the entree, carnitas, would not be too spicy for my wife, and I ordered the sea bass. The server asked if we wanted chips and salsa and my wife and I said \"sure\". He hollered to someone from there to bring some chips and salsa. \nA few minutes later we received the chips and salsa which were stale and had powdered chili on them. HELLO! \n\nOur appetizer of calamari was bland. It had two different sauces with it. One which was green and was OK. My wife asked that person who dropped off the chips n salsa, if she could order a frozen drink. She rarely drinks and I guessed she wanted to loosen up a little. The server came over after quite a while and said that they did not have a blender behind the bar to make frozen drinks with. Strange I thought but - whatever. No suggestions on anything else, just sorry no blender. My wife's vegetarian tortilla soup that she had ordered on the servers recommendation that it would not be spicy, was brought with a wonderful presentation by a friendly and sincerely happy young man. Unfortunately the soup was more like a tomato broth. She did not like it - and it was spicy. \n\nOur entrees came out and dropped off. No one asked if we needed anything else at the moment, if we could use another drink, not even a simple \"Enjoy\". My seabass was wrapped in some kind of parchment paper. Smelled pretty good, but was too spicy even for me who enjoys spicy food. My wife's carnitas she said was OK, also had some kind of salad to one side which on her first bite made her turn red and cry. She exclaimed \"This is SPICY!\" The server walks by and I tell him that he had said her dish would not be spicy. His response was, \"Oh just be careful with that,\" pointing at the salad, \"it has slices of Habanero in it.\" I couldn't believe it. The spiciest chili in the world, maybe, was on my wife's plate. And no sorry no nothing. Horrible. \n\nIt came to dessert, and my wife mentioned that we were there celebrating my birthday and the server went into a verbal list of desserts. I think the banana thing sounded OK but I didn't catch it all. My wife wanted the flan and I asked for an after dinner cordial, which the server didn't know if they had or not so he went to check. \n\nThe flan came out with a candle which was cool, but the drink didn't arrive 'till we were pretty much done with the flan - But the bad part about it was that the drink was not what I wanted at all. I tasted it and was very disappointed that the server just left it and didn't tell me that they didn't have what I wanted and assumed that I wouldn't know what he had brought to the table. The server finally came over after about 7 minutes and when l asked, if he had brought out what I had asked for and saw that the drink was still full, he said - \"No, but this is better, it's one step up from the other one.\" I looked at him and said I didn't want it. \n\nTo make it worse, my wife and I couldn't enjoy the rest of the night because we ended up getting sick. We were still burping up the food the next day at lunchtime. A horrible experience all around. So much so that I normally give places a second chance but am 99% sure this will be a first time no go again. The food was OK but not for the price, the service was the worst I have ever experienced.

We went in for a Saturday lunch service, and the place was pretty much empty (maybe four or five tables and our own). The hostess was nice and quickly took us to our table. The decor is electic, I guess, though I thought the wall of sconces was tacky and unnecessary, even more so given that they are located it at a walking distance from one of the only places in Las Vegas were design rules. Other than that, the ambiance was nice, music quite lame (Mexican pop artists, like Paulina Rubio...really?), the lighting dim, and the waiters friendly and biligual. \n\nWe ordered the fried calamari to start (about $15). They were executed well (crunchy, not soggy), and the dipping sauces were nice: one was green, with cilantro and serrano undertones, and the other was basically a chipotle mayo. For entrees, I ordered the chipotle glazed salmon with roasted vegetables, and my husband ordered the short rib enchiladas. The former was very good, though piping hot (maybe left a bit too long under the salamander). It was well portioned, and came drenched in a tomatillo sauce (good), and roasted veggies (including red peppers and zuchinni). It was $18, and overall, it was really good. The salmon was probably a defrosted version, but again, what can you realistically expect in this city?\n\nThe other entree, the short rib enchiladas, were very good (for about $16-$18). If you're really hungry, make sure you stock up on appetizers, as this plate only has two, albeit delicious, enchiladas. They are drenched in a red \"enchilada sauce\" (as most Americans will eagerly call it), and I was pleased to realize that it was very authentic-Mexican-tasting. They were also missing the signature cheddar chesse/sour cream toppings, that were infamously made popular by places like Taco Bell. Overall, they were delicious and I would definitely order them again. \n\nWe asked our waitress for a dessert menu, but she proceded to tell us there were \"churros con chocolate\" available. We shrugged, then she said they also had flan...and coffee. A bit lacking, I would say, and I would have preferred to look at a dessert menu, even though by that point, I was stuffed. \n\nOverall, the service is nice, the ambiance is romantic and casual, and the food is good.

Eleven o'clok on the dot on a fabulous Saturday morning we walk into this trendy restaurant - first ones there and quickly seated of course.  We were seated on a two person table with one chair that looked like a king's throne and the other was just a regular black restaurant chair.  Not that chairs matter because they don't.  The table was extremely wobbly, but their food runner was able to fix it for us.  \n\nService started off extremely slow.  My coffee and Edgar's arnold palmer came about ten minutes after ordering- which to me is much too long of a wait for drinks.  Edgar could see my annoyance and quickly reminded me to \"give it a chance and just enjoy myself.\"  I know I know.  I'm a bit of a snob with places like this, but hey- I'll give credit where credit is due! \n\nThe drinks came.  Coffee was okay (had tidbits of coffee remnants in it), and his arnold palmer was straight up iced tea.  BUT, the second round of drinks were fabulous, so I'll cut them some slack on that.  It was early, we were the first ones there- I understand the rough patches.\n\nAnyhow - we splurged today.  I ordered the benedicts and mexican french toast.  He ordered the chilaquiles and vanilla pancakes.  \n\nComplimentary chips and salsa were brought out first.  The chips were seasoned, but I wish they were warm.  It seemed like it was just taken out of a bag, and the salsa tasted bottled.  BOTTLED?!  Ahh!  I'm not 100% certain that it was because I didn't ask, but it didn't have that fresh taste.  HOWEVER I won't count this against the restaurants since #1) it's free and #2) chips and salsa - who cares??\n\nBenedict Mexicano: Fabulous.  Their take on eggs benedicts is divine.  Instead of an english muffin they make their own jalapeno cornbread.  It was just a tad too sweet to my liking, but it was nicely balanced out with their take on hollandaise sauce (tasted very creamy - like they used la crema?) and pork carnitas instead of canadian bacon.  Oh, and each topped with a perfectly poached egg.  When you cracked the egg, and the creamy yolk ever so slowly spread throughout the dish like molten lava over a valley, you couldn't help but try to make time go faster.  Okay, the yolk wasn't spreading that slowly, but that's what it felt like - I couldn't help that time was going in slow motion because of the beauty of the dish, give me a break will yea?  But oh my word, it was great!  The hollandaise didn't have that lemony zest taste like standard run of the mill hollandaise.  It was crema creamy and had a slight green chile flavor to it.  You can see the bits of green chile, but the flavor was very very light so not to overpower the sauce.  \n\nChicken Chilaquiles: Looked dry, but it was juicy as heck!  Everything was nicely balanced, and the flavors - oh the flavors.  It all worked harmoniously together .  \n\nAs for the french toast and vanilla pancakes.  Ehh- they were good, but they weren't out of this world fantastic.  I wouldn't go screaming at the top of my lungs for everyone far and wide to try them.  I was searching high and low for the oaxacan chocolate butter on the french toast, and I think it ran away upon arriving to the table.  It was nowhere to be found.  The dulce de crema spread was good and not too sweet, so I liked that.  The pancakes I just got a bite of, so I can't really judge it.  It was more on the dense side, but the vanilla flavor was present and very nice.\n\nThey then surprised me with my favorite dessert -- FLAN!  The flan (don't tell my mama) was ALMOST like hers!  It was WONDERFUL!  It was light but decadent and had all the flavors you look for in flan.  Caramely, creamy, sweet goodness.  I reminded Edgar that he wasn't a big fan of flan, so it was okay if he didn't eat it with me.  Low and behold, he forgot his dislike for flan because he helped me with half of it!  \n\nAll in all, I'd definitely come back.

Talk about fancy!\n\nThis place doesn't remind you of your typical Mexican jaunt.  It definitely isn't supposed to give that vibe to you I guess.  Mundo is called a 'latin chic' restaurant...meaning to me 'frou-frou'.  The atmosphere is very modern and yes, very chic.  Dark woods, light tablecloths, expensive lighting, it's all there.  The crowd that hangs out there strikes me as having some money to flaunt with.  So all you gold-digger yelpers out there...this place is for you!  Ha Ha, I kid...but seriously.  If you find your next rich husband or wife there, throw a guy a bone for hooking you up!\n\nI hear that one of the investors of Mundo was a candidate running for mayor of Las Vegas several years back.  Can't remember his name off the top of my head at the moment.  Oh well.  But the night I was there for the birthday celebration it was busy because Oscar Goodman was in the house, celebrating his wife Carolyn's run for mayor.  So it was noisy, but at least the restaurant was bustling with business.\n\nOn to the food.  Verdict came back as pretty good.  It is for sure fancy Mexican/Latin food.  We sampled a bunch of things from their appetizer and dinner menu:\n\n-Fresh guacamole\n-Crispy Calamari - with cilantro serrano & sweet chipotle dipping sauce\n-Ahi Tuna Tostada - with spicy red chile vinaigrette\n-Chicen Satay - with achiote tamarind chile glaze\n-Skirt Steak Skewers - with chimichurri glaze\n-Steak and Chicken Tacos - with salsa, avocado, onion & cilantro, Chihuahua cheese\n-Chilean Sea Bass Tacos - with cabbage, pico de gallo, avocado\n\nPrices were fair for the entire menu, no entree over $35, while many of the items on the menu hovered between the $10-$18 range.  Food was fresh, my favs being the Ahi Tuna Tostada and the tacos.  Flavors were good, not traditional in any sense but modern and updated.  Good overall, although I would say that I would have enjoyed having an old school plate of authentic lengua tacos with onion & cilantro just as much.  I like simple!\n\nWe enjoyed many a cocktail as well.  I stuck with a couple of Mexican beers to compliment the food, a Modelo Especial and a Negra Modelo.  My lady tried a Mundo Mojito, and a Mundo Margarita.  Both of which she said were very good with the fresh-squeezed lime.  The premier tequila at Mundo is Alien Tequila.  This is because the owners of this restaurant are also investor/owners of the Alien brand.  Savvy, eh?\n\nService was good but a bit slow because it was packed, and much of their help seemed to go to making Oscar and his wife particularly comfortable.  Catering to the mayor, right!\n\nIf you want a fancy Latin flair night on the town, go to Mundo.  It will fit the bill nicely.  I swear, it kinda felt like J. Lo was gonna walk in with Marc Anthony at any moment!  Or Pitbull with his entourage!  \"I was playing with her....she was playing with me...next thing you know, we were playing with three...\"\n\nMe?

I'd have to say everyone in our party loved the trip, with the highlight being the trip to this fine establishment.\n\nThey set up a spacious back room for us that was decorated just perfect.

When we entered, there was no hostess, so we went near the bar area and asked one of the waiters if we just seat ourselves. He said, \"Yeah go ahead, sit anywhere and one of the other waiters will help you.\" Ok, no problem. We looked over the happy hour menu and decided upon a Sangria ($5), Mundo Martini ($6), Mundo Fries ($3), and Crispy Calamari ($8). If only there were someone willing to take our orders.... Ten minutes passes by and we still haven't been greeted by any of the waiters.\n\nWe notice a group of people coming in the restaurant and figure we're sure to be helped before they are. Wrong! The hostess that wasn't there before goes up to them and starts hugging everyone. They're all given a table, menus, and water immediately. That really ticked us off, so Don just went up to the bar and asked them if we're just suppose to order at the bar and bring the food/drinks to our table ourselves. The bartender felt pretty bad that we hadn't been helped at all yet, so she said she'd get everything for us. She took our orders, had water and complimentary chips/dip sent to our table, and brought the drinks over to our table. She was pretty much our server for the rest of our time there. Her customer service alone is what made us decide to give the place another star. Rather than just making us wait for someone else to finally come along, she went out of her way to start serving us on her own even though it wasn't her job. She kept coming over to our table to ask us how we were doing and how we were liking the food and drinks too.\n\nOne of the other servers finally came up to us (before we got our food and drinks) and just said, \"Are you guys going to be ordering anything?\" Seriously!? As if we were just planning on lounging at a dining table looking around for waiters for no reason... That guy never even greeted or said anything to us in the first place. It was really annoying. We told him we waited for a long time, so we just went to the bar to order. I feel like our bartender/waitress did a better job than any of the actual waiters would've done.\n\nOn to the food...\n\nThis is what really made me decide to give Mundo a four star rating. The calamari dish was probably one of the best I've ever had. I am a big fan of crispy (not burned) food and, just like the title says, the calamari is very crispy. They managed to make it very crispy, but not oily or greasy. It came with two sauces: cilantro serrano and sweet chipotle . They were both very good; It was even hard to decide which one I wanted to dip my calamari in. I would venture out here just for this dish alone. The Mundo Fries (sweet potato and Idaho potato) were also phenomenal. They were very crispy on the outside but perfectly cooked on the inside. The seasonings added to both dishes really intensified the flavors. I could eat both dishes without any dipping sauces and they'd still taste fantastic. Don described the complimentary chips we got as tasting \"organic.\" I'm guessing that's a good thing? I don't know, but they tasted good with the salsa and both of the dipping sauces that came with the calamari (yes, I like to experiment).\n\nTo be honest, I REALLY wanted to give this place one star in the beginning, but the more the bartender helped the more I thought to myself, \"Oh no, I can't give them one star anymore, she's too nice!\" Then they brought out the food and I was totally sold.

We started off with chips and salsa and a wonderful  guacamole with diced onions and tomatoes, slices of radishes, and topped with cilantro and cotija cheese.\n\nThe chicken taquito appetizer consists of two taquitos cut in half and topped with sour cream, cotija cheese and green onions, with some lettuce and a sweet chile paste beside them. The chicken was a touch dry, but in combination with the other ingredients the flavors were excellent.\n\nMy wife's dish was a large chile relleno stuffed with cubes of filet mignon, potatoes, wild mushrooms, and goat cheese in a smoke chile sauce. If you like a little heat, this is the dish to get. The tender beef was a great vehicle to soak up the smokiness of the sauce and deliver a bold punch of flavor to the palate.\n\nI'm a sucker for some swine, so I went with the carnitas and they didn't disappoint. You'd be hard pressed to find a better version in Vegas. The succulent chunks of pork was sitting in a large mound in the center of the plate with onions and cilantro on one side, avocado pico de gallo on another, and a cucumber habanero salad on the opposite side of the plate. The pork contained a balanced ratio of mostly lean meat with a little fat here and there to offset it with some additional flavor.\n\nFor dessert we had churros. The eight small pieces were filled with a caramel sauce in the center and had some additional caramel drizzled on top. Also on the plate was a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a small bowl of chocolate sauce. It would have been a great way to end the meal but they brought out one more thing after that.\n\nAn order of flan came out with a candle on top and two of the waiters sang happy birthday to my wife. I definitely wasn't expecting them to sing. I thought they only did that type of thing at TGI Friday's or place like that. But, it was much appreciated. As for the flan, it was unbelievably light, smooth and creamy with none of the eggy taste you get from lesser variations of the dish. Mom, I'm sorry to say this, but I've found flan that's better than yours.\n\nFor drinks we had a margarita and mojito, which we were happy with and we checked in through Yelp and got a free glass of wine!\n\nThe dinner was close to being perfect, but the service could have been better. Despite our waiter being very informative and friendly, he was too busy to give any of his many, many tables *great* service.

I think it was the chipotle one that was pretty good.\n\nWe got complimentary chips and salsa too.  The salsa was so good!  Very fresh and light.\n\nService was a little strange.  I wasn't sure if we had just one waiter or two.  When you asked them a question, it was like a one word answer.  Its not like they were rude... they just weren't nice.

Let me explain...\n\nI made reservations for dinner here before we were to go see Bela Fleck at The Smith Center.  It was our 5 year anniversary and I wanted to have a nice night with a fancy dinner and this place was perfect with its location.  We got to Mundo at about 5:45 and the concert was just a block away and didn't start until 7:30.  Plenty of time, right?\n\nWe were seated immediately and I fell in love with the place.  A romantic atmosphere, a great menu with several vegetarian items, not really pricey, and a friendly wait staff.  My husband started off with a beer (4 bucks! It was a steal!) and I had some really great wine (don't remember the name, white wine from Spain- yum).  We started to munch on chips while we looked at the menu.\n\nMy husband ordered the garden enchiladas and I ordered the chile relleno.  This is where things started to get hairy.  Apparently there is a vegetarian chile relleno as well as steak.  You can see where this is going, can't you?\n\nWe get our dinners and everything looks great.  My husband loves his.  I take a bite of mine and it's really good.  I take a second bite and notice something chewy....that's odd, maybe there's a big mushroom in there?  I start to poke around and find this little brown bit.  Mushroom?  Take a tiny bite.  Nope, don't think so.  Dig a little more and there's a giant piece of steak looking at me.\n\nOk, so again: I know, I know.  Dietary restrictions... can't be picky eating out.  I get it.  But do you know how gross it is to know you've eaten meat for the first time in 4 years?  Uuuuuughhhhhhhhh.  And it didn't even taste like anything!  Take note, meat eaters!\n\nAt this point I am pissed, steak is looking at me, and my waiter is nowhere to be seen.  Why?  Because Mundo decided to have a giant party right next to our table and he was busy taking drink orders for the two dozen people talking as loud as they possibly could.  This party started up about the same time I got my steak chile relleno.  \n\nWell there went our date night.\n\nRomantic atmosphere?  Gone.  Yummy food?  Gone.  Helpful wait staff?  Gone.  It is 6:30 and the concert is starting in an hour.  Needless to say, my poor husband was dealing with a very crabby girl.\n\nSo I'm giving this place 3 stars.  It was my fault for assuming there was only a vegetarian chile relleno on the menu but I also think my waiter should have clarified which one I wanted to order (especially after my husband ordered from the vegetarian menu).  And although our waiter wasn't around the second part of our meal, it wasn't his fault that he got stuck with too many tables and the giant party next to us.  I do, however, hold Mundo accountable for sitting us next to the social hour hovering over our table when we had reservations and there were plenty of seats elsewhere when we first got in.  Not cool.\n\nBut I have to give credit where credit is due, and the food was amazing.  The VEGETARIAN chile relleno was great and my husband loved his enchiladas.  The chips and salsa were good and the side of street corn was probably our favorite thing.  The beer prices are great and the wine prices are average.  I loved my glass of wine.  Our waiter also did give us a (small) discount for the misunderstanding without me complaining (I'm not the type to yell at waiters).  He was also friendly throughout even though he was super busy.\n\nSo, after this giant review I guess what I'm trying to say is this place would have been 5 stars if I wasn't sitting next to the social hour party and especially if I had a meat-free item from the get-go.  The food here is great and the restaurant is beautiful.  It has a perfect location if you are looking for somewhere to eat or drink before heading to The Smith Center.

I've been making annual pilgrimages to Rick Bayless's Chicago restaurants, Fronterra Grill/Topolobombo, since a coworker turned me onto them eight or nine years ago.\n\nRick Bayless is the man who has elevated Mexican food to a religious experience for foodies. When I asked my partner who is the chef de cuisine at home where he wanted to eat during our week in Vegas, he said \"See if Rick Bayless has opened a restaurant in Vegas.\"\n\nThe restaurant, Mundo,  is located in a Frank Gerry inspired complex of buildings near downtown Las Vegas called the \"World Market Center\".  The development is huge and unfortunately has white elephant written all over it.  I half-expected to see tumbleweeds blowing past the windows. I did a web search this morning and learned that the building owners had just defaulted on a half billion dollar loan.\n\nMundo itself is unpretentious, a welcome contrast to the overblown ghost town it sits in. We were there on a Monday night and the place was barely half full. We were seated and the chips arrive promptly with a red salsa. Up to this point, anybody unfamiliar with Rick Bayless would have been lulled into thinking \"this reminds me of Chevy's\" and \"maybe I should be a little wild and order the Cadillac margarita\".\n\nThen you eat your first chip with the salsa and your taste buds search the salsa database in your head and you realize you haven't had this variation. It's a thin sauce that coats your chip and imparts this smoky, roasted tomato/chili flavor. That Cadillac margarita comes and goes down easily. There is none of the aftertaste you get with high fructose corn syrup.\n\nWhat Rick Bayless does as well as any chef that I've experienced is that he plays \"flavor notes\". This is my own terminology for how I experience food. A good chef can register a flavor note or two per dish. Bayless hits several. It's the difference between hearing \"Chopsticks\" and a Bach sonata.\n\nI skipped an appetizer so I could relax and enjoy the cocktail, chips, and guacamole.  My partner had the Mundo Chopped Salad. There's probably ten ingredients with a chipotle molasses vinaigrette. I take a bite and hear music.\n\nMy entree is a chile relleno stuffed with filet mignon, potatoes, wild mushrooms, and goat cheese covered with a smoked chili sauce. Our waiter warns me that the dish can be too spicy for American tastes. Well into my Cadillac margarita, I throw caution to the window and tell him to bring it on. The chili packs a punch but it is a couple of steps in back of my threshold. The filet mignon is tender and favorable. I eat everything except for the stem of the chili. My partner has the Sarape de Pollo. It looks like a quesidilla but is anything but. It is a piece of chicken pounded to look like a tortilla then it's topped with black beans, manchego, mint chimichurri, guacamole, and pico de gallo. He raves about the dish.\n\nWe have banana empanadas and tres leche cake for dessert. I barely get a bite of the empanads from my partner but the tres leche cake holds its own in comparison. Our server, Jose, has been gracious and attentive throughout the meal. There is nothing rote about the service. He makes suggestions during the meal to heighten our experience - like adding a bite of the unused guacamole with the chile relleno or going for the Cadillac.\n\nWe leave thinking that regular Mexican food will never taste the same again.

The host was very sweet and polite\nand said they were serving dinner and happy hour. I told her we had a\nbaby in a car seat (she is 8 weeks old and sleeps all day as newborns do)- and could we bring her into the restaurant with us to eat. She said she'd check and seconds later she said it would be fine.\n\nWe arrived, were politely greeted, the host acknowledged that I had\ncalled, and she brought us to our table. There was not ONE OTHER\nPERSON in the restaurant. I repeat- we were the only people there. We\nsat down and the server/ bartender greeted us and we ordered a\ncocktail. We then ordered several items off the happy hour menu. The\nbaby was being great (still in her carseat), we had cocktails, food on\nits way- so far so good.\n\nThen a man (owner Mingo Collaso) walked up to our table and said, \"I\nwant you to know there's nothing I can do about it now, but children\nare not allowed in the restaurant.\" I looked at him with a confused look,\nsince we had been seated there by the host, and said, \"Well, I called\nahead and asked--\" and he interrupted me and said, \"I don't care.

Why are you being so\nrude?\" He responded again about how children were not allowed, and I\npointed out that there was not one other person in the restaurant and\nwe had called and asked.

Yelp is my Diary and I write it like it is. Based on my experience at Mundo I am writing a review that places it in the middle of the rating spectrum.\n\n   After the UYE at Springs Preserve, I joined my Yelp friends  for more good times at Mundo Restaurant. I was not hungry but up to socializing with yelpers and a couple of tequilas.\n\n  The tequilas were strong. When I walked into the restaurant later than everybody, some of my yelp friends were laughing and  having a great time. Right off the bat, I had to try their tequila. After I took a few sips of my tequila, I was laughing and very relaxed. The tequila was so good that I wanted another one. This is when I found out that the service here is kind of slow. I knew the waiter was busy serving our group. So I walked across the fancy dining room to the bar. There is an issue. The bar tender was also a waiter. The result was a wait for the tequila. Finally I rejoined my Yelp peers at the table carrying my second tequila.\n\n  The place itself is a nice environment to hang out in. Although it is in the Furniture Center Complex, it is a restaurant that would be at home in Beverly Hills, It is just a very fancy restaurant.\n\n   Interior design and the good times I shared with my Yelper friends is not saving Mundo from achieving above three stars in my review. There are some issues that don't fly by me. First, another Yelper paid for his drink at the bar, and that drink was also reflected on that individuals check. I have been to three restaurants with Yelp peers. This is the first restaurant to add each yelper's tab on one bill. I do not like that! I especially did not like that when the waiter told us that we were $18 short. Even after two strong tequilas! Realistically there is no way to add up everybody's tab and see who came up short. That is if anybody really did come up short. This also begs the question, \"If we paid the tip was there still a gratuity charge?\" We probably will never know. We each chipped in the extra money to make up for the alleged $18 short of paying the bill. Adding each person's tab on one bill is just poor business. Then alleging that we are $18 short is just poor business. The nice environment and socializing with the Yelper friends with the strong tequila kept the rating at three stars.\n\nReview 66 of the 2013 Yelp 100 Challenge", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 4, "cool": 5}}, {"text": "In Vegas for a Girls' weekend and was super excited we had reservations for a Rick Bayless place.\n\nMundo is in a design center...somewhat strange locale but the restaurant is 'Latin Chic,\" we went with it.

The show was at 7:30 and we got there just after our 6:00 reservation. Well, two of us got there--the other two were running a bit late but we went ahead and ordered drinks & guacamole. The service was good; they were quite busy and our server let us know we needed to order within the next 5 minutes if we wanted to make our show. We appreciated his letting us know. \n\nThe ambiance is nice as well, and the location obviously is the biggest plus for show peeps. I had brunch here a few months back and it was reasonably priced and decent--plus I think at the time, we were just happy to find ANYPLACE that could fit us in for brunch before a matinee. There is a dearth of decent restaurants around the Smith Center. \n\nThis is probably the main reason Mundo does so well; the dinner menu is quite expensive, the cocktails not much better than Strip prices and the food is okay at best, IMO. \"Upscale Mexican.\" Whatever. I think the word \"upscale\" is just a good reason to charge more.  \nThe chips and salsa are good and the cocktails were fine also. The guacamole was really really spicy-- to the point that two members of our party couldn't even eat it. Really? It's guacamole. It's pretty basic and tasty without you trying to all fancy it up with your extra hot peppers or whatever you put in there. It was also $9 for about a third of a cup.\n\nI decided to splurge and ordered the filet mignon chile relleno for $26. Ordered it med rare but was told it is served med well and you don't have an option. I assumed that must mean they were pre-made or something. The presentation was nice and it had potential, but the sauce was so overly spicy that it was hard to taste anything else. The steak itself wasn't that tender or tasty. \n\nOne of my friends had the grilled calamari, which she really liked. Another had the vegetarian relleno and the other had chicken enchiladas. Both of them felt their food was too spicy as well. \n\nDon't get me wrong; I can enjoy good spicy Mexican food. But flavor should come first, not heat factor.  \n\nWe didn't have time for desert and it did take a little time to figure out the $175 check. He said he couldn't split it, which I understand and should have known better than to even ask. Word of advice: when dining with friends and planning to pay individually, bring enough cash. Having waited tables myself, I remember how difficult and timely it can be to split a check so each person can use his or her credit card, especially when they are busy. This is why they will tell you \"no.\"  It is not to annoy you. \n\nI doubt I'll go back. I guess I prefer my Mexican food more old fashioned and budget friendly.

And because it was at night, and most of the business at the World Market Center had ended already, the restaurant was pretty empty.  There may have been another party or two present, but I barely even noticed.  There was one server serving us all night, and he was fun, although slightly (or more than slightly) off.  That didn't make for a bad experience, but just some confusing moments.\n\nOur table started off with chips & salsa, guac, and margaritas.  One of the women at my table wasn't drinking, so our server asked if she wanted to the bartender to make a non-alcoholic cocktail, which was sweet.  So she went with that.  Considering that it would probably have been an $8 drink, if she were charged for it, I think she would have been happier with just a soda or lemonade instead.

I should have gone with my gut since I've wanted a sweet corn tamale since the last time I saw it on a menu about 4 years ago.  But since someone already ordered the sweet corn tamale, our server convinced me to get the mexican style street corn.  It wasn't bad, but it was richer than my palette prefers. I had a bite of the sweet corn tamale and it was exactly what would have satisfied my longing. But let's rewind to the actual entree! I'll just have to say that my medium rare prepared bone-in ribeye was perfect!  It's a larger portion than I could have finished in one sitting, but because it was perfect in so many ways, I really just wanted to sit there all night nibbling on it.  Perfectly cooked.

Self-identifying as \"chic\" for starters. I don't even know what \"chic\" is, but it sure doesn't enhance the restaurant's allure and actually makes it seem silly and precious. Maybe \"chic\" is how you get away with charging twenty four dollars for carnitas tacos and twenty six for shrimp tamales. Those are Topolobampo prices, and Mundo is very good but Mundo is no Topolobampo. It's hard to fuss when you taste the food, though, and the food was delicious from jump street. I never thought I would utter the words \"best chips and salsa of all time,\" but there you go. They arrive at your table swiftly upon being seated, a generous plate of chips dusted with a dark chili powder of some kind. It was subtle but gave the chips a lovely warmth and depth that perfectly accompanied the complexly flavored salsa. I detected smoke, sweetness, tartness, and a just a bit of heat in the salsa--it was remarkable, a true marvel of salsa engineering. Swoon-inducing. I wanted to rise and slow-clap to a Snow Patrol song.  \n\nThe idea being to share everything, we ordered the ahi tuna tostada for starters, the carnitas with a side of sauteed spinach for the entree and a side of their \"risotto.\" Alas, they were out of carnitas! Visibly crushed and deflated, we went with the skirt steak instead. Perhaps because of my histrionics, or perhaps because my dining companion had mentioned that she wanted to say hi to her friend George, the owner, or perhaps she's just that thoughtful--our waitress came back a few minutes later saying the kitchen had *just* enough carnitas left for one taco and brought it to us gratis. And oh, such carnitas. As with the salsa, itsflavor profile is astonishing; assertive but layered. First you get smoke from a grill, then comes a combination of sweetness and a bit of kick, with a long lingering finish. The meat is succulent and perfectly balanced. Slow-clap number two for the bonus carnitas taco. At this point Mundo could have slept with my best friend and I'd still take her back.  \n\nNot much to say about the tostada, however, which was a tad one-note. The tortilla was dense and the \"sushi grade\" tuna was rather of the all-you-can-eat variety--heavy and even chewy. There was a nice bit of heat at the end, but it was sort of too-little too-late. Not a terrible dish, but the weakest of the meal. \n\nThe skirt steak re-confirmed what the salsa and carnitas had promised. It was grilled to a perfect medium-rare as requested, and sliced against the grain at a severe angle which shows the chef knows whats up. Most impressive of all was the rub, a crusty black bark of infinite spice. Entire worlds of dark, tragically beautiful flavor are packed into that crust. That crust is like the black obelisk in 2001: A Space Odyssey, containing all of humanity's dread and limitless potential at once. It was the single greatest taste experience of the meal. My only gripe with the steak is that they make a fuss about using \"wagyu.\" Anyone can buy skirt steak for about seven bucks a pop and achieve the same level of juicy tenderness. Skirt steak is a heroic cut that aims to please. One doesn't need \"wagyu,\" which promises greater levels of tenderness and fat, because skirt steak is already perfectly tender and no one could detect the marbling underneath all those enormous flavors in the rub and the chimichurri and \"marinated avocados\" (?). This was Mundo being chic, I fear, using the word \"wagyu\" as a way to charge penthouse prices for a street-level cut. \n\nWe were excited to have the \"risotto\" along with the steak, but some wires got crossed and it didn't come. I mentioned to our lovely server how excited I was to try the risotto and it arrived a few minutes later in what looked like a small soup bowl. At that point the meal was almost finished, and while the risotto did harmonize nicely with the steak it was just too heavy to get through. The flavors were splendid, once again, but the dish needs to be dialed way down. It's overkill; the texture is heavy and the flavors don't sing they scream. Because it was neglected, our waitress said the dish was \"on her.\" Another nice move on her part. \n\nThe location of this restaurant, at the base of a building the size of a small planet, is an atrocity of convenience. I've lived downtown for two years and this was my first visit. And the \"chic\" factor can seriously grate, as certain flourishes (like \"wagyu\") are unnecessary and distracting, and costly.

We brought our 2.5 year old out for a nice family dinner, which I must admit I was nervous about after reading other guest reviews. We had no problem taking him with us, the staff were welcoming enough. There were even a couple of other families with kids of varying ages, which raised the comfort level at 8pm on a Saturday evening. \n\nThe restaurant is beautifully decorated, romantic, etc...we enjoyed the atmosphere while ordering some fresh guacamole to go with the complimentary chips and salsa and my Cadillac margarita. The margarita was delicious, the guacamole was good but nothing out of this world. The salsa was also okay by my review, my date really enjoyed the salsa, I prefer char in my salsa, so it's just a matter of difference of tastes\n\nFor dinner, I went with the vegetarian tamale and a side of wild mushrooms. My date went with the chicken enchilada with side of fries (kid friendly). I'm not a vegetarian, but this dish just sounded good for my tastes that eveining and also think if a restaurant can serve up a really tasty vegetarian dish, they can pack some flavor. I didn't notice a kids menu, so we decided to share our dishes and our son liked the chicken enchilada, the fries were a big hit, and I even got some of my veggies in , which meant we would be ordering a dessert (we usually skip dessert) 8)\n\nI really enjoyed the tamale, everything was flavorful and spicy, but not overly spiced. Good sauce, vegetables were cooked properly and the filling was a good level of sweetness to balance. Also, with the chips, guacamole, sides, etc, there's no way I could eat the whole thing, so most went home for lunch the next day, bonus! And, like I mentioned, even got the 2.5 year old to try a few bites. Wild mushrooms were satisfying. I tried a bite of the enchilada and though the chicken was maybe on the dryer side, the favors were very good and my partner finished it all with the help of out son. The fries are a mix of potatoes and sweet potatoes-  they didn't stand a chance against our son, he loved those! We tried them, they were yummy.\n\nLast part of the evening were the churros. They come with a chocolate dipping sauce. I wasn't blown away, but they were a good sweet ending. \nWe will go again, probably just the 2 of us for date night next time.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Mundo is a  nicely decorated space, modern and chic.

First of all, there were 4 open tables (at least) and spots at the bar that she could have directed them towards or at the very least explained that the tables that were open were being held for other reservations, but that they were welcome to wait to see if the parties showed up. Instead they were just told no, and turned away. As an owner, I would have fired my manager at the very least over something like this, but as I have come to learn through speaking with prominent government officials and judges that know the owner personally and have frequented this restaurant in the past, he simply does not care how inept his staff is or how his restaurant is run. In addition I should expect him to reply to this complaint on YELP by him denying this ever happened or finding excuses for it as opposed to apologizing for a horrible experience. \n\nNow, you may be asking yourself, how could this be? This restaurant survives because of its location and the lack of this type of cuisine in the immediate area. It is supported during the day by The World Market Center and at night by The Smith Center and unassuming tourists that do not know any better. \n\nOnto my meal.

Despite not having a problem with this at all, our servers were incredibly apologetic, took it off our bill and gave us a complimentary bowl of olives! It was definitely worth the wait.

When brought to your table, you can choose if you want a few toppings added to it or not.  The anchovies were very tasty.

The class is at 10AM... it's hard not to go hungover from the debaucheries of the night before in Vegas, but it's well worth it!!", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 1, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "Part of the Lettuce Entertain You group of restaurants, Cafe Ba Ba Reeba started out in Chicago, then opened a branch in Las Vegas.  It specializes in tapas.  Originally intended as bar snacks, the term now refers to small portions of food (at least in the United States).  Choose a few and you have a meal; choose a bunch and you have a meal for a group of friends.\n\nIn addition to tapas, the menu offers paella and a few other items, but tapas are the stars. There are more than 50 choices, plus another dozen desserts.  Cold tapas include serrano ham, olives and chicken salad; hot tapas include octopus, empanadas and roast dates with bacon.\n\nThe inside dining areas are dark: dark stained wood flooring, dark wood tables, moderate lighting.  Loud guitar music plays; a Flamenco version of \"California Dreamin'\" was one of the more unusual selections.  The outside area, facing the strip, seemed much more inviting, but it was too hot outside for me.  Service was prompt; I ordered tapas one at a time, and they arrived pretty quickly.\n\nAt Cafe Ba Ba Reeba, tapas have been supersized.  A typical dish could serve as a small appetizer for four people, or as an hors d'oeuvre for even more people.  I was hard pressed to finish just three plates.  Serrano ham, salchichon, chorizo & manchego cheese also included triangles of toasted bread with chopped tomato on top.  Both the cheese and meats were thinly sliced, and very strongly flavored.  A winner.  It wasn't finger food, definitely requiring a knife and fork, but was big enough that it would best be split several ways.\n\nRoast dates with bacon and apple vinaigrette was an interesting dish.  Small dates (or perhaps halves of large dates) were wrapped in bacon, then grilled until the bacon was crispy and the dates were very chewy.  A small amount of vinaigrette was poured on top.  It was an unusual combination of sweet, salty, sour and fatty tastes.\n\nGrilled squid in olive oil and garlic consisted of large pieces of squid (both body and tentacles) sauted in olive oil.  Barely cooked through, the squid was still tender.  It was a little oily, but I liked it.\n\n\n\nThe food was OK, but as a solo diner I didn't really enjoy myself.  The supposedly tapa sized portions are actually quite large, and not conducive to ordering many dishes if one is dining alone.

Once, the waiter jumped in and said \"no, that's table 23!\", the other two times we took an honest tack and sent the order away.  \nOver a period of about 1 1/2 hours we got our dishes, except the pizza.  This as really the only thing that my brother-in-law (a finicky sort) had ordered.  Since he ordered his tomato, mozerrella and olive pizza sans olives, we have a suspicion that his pizza went out twice to the wrong table, as we saw to oliveless pizzas pass by without stopping.  Or maybe the rest of the crowd hates olives too.\nThey finally wrangled the pizza, which they comp'd after we said we didn't want it at all.\nIf there were staff issues, etc., going on, we didn't know about it, as no manager fessed up.  They seemed to have plenty of staff, although none of them seemed to know what table they were in charge of.  They also seemed to be running two restaurants out of the kitchen, so you may want to steer clear of Stripburger, too.\nBasically, the food was decent, but the service was so chaotic that it was palpable.", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "My husband and friends all loved this place!

We decided to try it.\n\nWe arrived and they couldn't find our reservations.  However, they sat us since it was only 6pm.  The service was great if you arrive early.  Our server gave us a warning about the paella dish taking 35 mins to make so we ordered it as soon as he said it.  All our food was amazing, especially the spinach, mushroom soup, and scallop.  Everything was great so far, but staff became less attentive when 7pm came.  \n\nWe finished all our dishes and the paella was still nowhere to be seen.  By now it had been 45 mins since we ordered.  We saw 3 come out but all going to a different table.  2 going to tables who were sat at least 20 mins after us.  We informed our server and he checked and coming back saying they were having trouble with the rice and itshould be out in a bit.  15 mins passed and still nothing.  By now, we've been sitting without food for 30 mins.  Finally it came at 7:40pm.  \n\nWe were all so excited until we took a bite.  The rice was not done!  We told our waiter and he had a manager come over.  He explained to is that they cook the paella al dente and there should be a bite to it.  We explained that we understood what al dente was and this is simply not cooked and is not al dente.  He took our whole dish away and never returned.  Another server came by and we explained that our paella was not cook and that was why we were not eating off our plate so he took them away and said he would look into it.  No one came out and we asked for our check.  They did not take the plate off our bill and they didn't inform us or showed that they were taking any action to correct this.  The chef finally came out after we paid the bill and said that this is the way they cook their paella and was sorry that we didn't like it.  And said he could have another made, but we were no longer in the mmod and did not want to wait for another 35 mins.  It was 8:00pm already.  \n\nI believed they forgot or messed up our order and that was why we waited so long.  And they rushed to get the plate to us so it was not cooked.  And they didn't believe us and said we were wrong to think it was undercooked.  The dished cost $90 for 4 and we expected better service and quality from a place like this.  \n\nI would give the restaurant some time to perfect their craft before coming here again.

Grilled baby squids, charcutterie platter, spanish omellete (or pizza?), and mushroom risotto.\nGrilled baby squids tastes fresh and well seasoned. The portion is a bit small. (B+)\nSpanish omellete is very good. Tasty and the portion is decent. (A-)\nCharcutterie is overrated and overpriced for the price that is charged. The meat is sliced so paper thin and the ham is dry that I barely can taste what it is supposed to be like. The chorizo is the only salvation in this dish. (B-)\nMushroom risotto is quite good, but again, the portion is pretty small. (B)\nSangria is good, but a bit on the pricier side.

The restaurant is called Julian Serrano, and the prices certainly reflect the chef's arrogance as much as the name. Everything was great, but if I had to come up with a sixth taste (besides sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami) it would be 'value,' because the value of a dish, or lack thereof, seems to make things taste different to me. When you order here you are hoping for dishes that are so unique and wonderful that the prices are justified, yet when the food comes out of the kitchen it becomes evident your expectations were too high and disappointment is inevitable. Take for example the imported Spanish 'pata negra' ham, described on the menu as 'the most delicious ham in the world' for $35. Obviously this is a ridiculously bold and definitive statement for anyone to make about a single meat, however, hopeful me fell for the marketing and ordered it anyways. While the ham was certainly lovely, and I can't say I specifically remember ever eating another that I found better, it was still a meager portion of ham for $35 and I've had comparable before (the curing of meats throughout Europe is an art form, and I've been lucky enough to experience this first hand).\n\nThe combination of small portions and hefty prices is bound to result in continued disappointment as you make your way through the menu. The scallop was done about as well as any other, but $12 for one of them is just too much to ask. The mushroom risotto ($10) was creamy but slightly underdone and the salmon with truffle ($12) was just so so. Definitely pass on the avocado canneloni ($10) which I found to be texturally amiss and void of any redeeming flavor. The almond stuffed dates ($8) were alright, but not only are the dates at Firefly a better value, they taste better as well. These dates had a panko bread coating that was unnecessary and bulky, which took focus away from the dates themselves, and the accompanying spicy sauce didn't pair well with them at all. The cheese plate ($14) included cana de cabra (soft goat milk cheese), aged manchego, and soft sheep milk extremedura, and was served with a fruit compote and soft toasty bread. Each cheese was complex, and it's hard not to love cheese, but I don't know if anyone other than the producers can really take credit for making a fine cheese plate. The piquillo peppers were delightful, with an oozy cheese center that was far more sophisitcated than that of Firefly, but was not worth the $10.\n\nThe good news is that I found the least expensive dishes to be some of the best anyway. The open-faced Pan Manchego ($8) was a revelation in grilled cheese, and the beet salad ($10) was not only an architectural gem but a well-balanced and colorful creation. The steamed mussels ($9) were plump and the broth was something special, though it was frustrating to capture in the shell spoons because of the pot used to serve them. In addition to tasting better than most of the other dishes, this was also the best value on the menu. If you order these items I think you'll be happier with your experience and your bill.\n\nTip: I noticed from the menu pictures taken by another blogger that prices were $3-5 less in December of last year.

The pepper sauce was smokey with a small kick.  These little nuggets were polished off in probably 30 seconds, they were just that good!\n\ncalamari a la plancha: baby squid.  Extremely tender with a great lemon bite.  Probably the best calamari I have ever had.  Not one single piece was chewy.\n\nahi tuna tempura: Two pieces of ahi tempura battered and fried. The ahi was still rare which was nice. Probably my least favorite dish if only because I have had different versions of this dish at Japanese restaurants.  However, I really dug the wasabi foam.\n\nmolecular tuna raspberry skewer:  We had to order one of the \"molecular\" tapas just because off all the talk on yelp.  I kind of liked it but then again it was  nothing too special.  Sort of weird to eat a somewhat fishy/fruity jello.  Still not that bad.\n\nhuevos estrellados:  This dish was crazy insane good.  Perfectly cooked eggs on top of amazingly tasty potatoes and bite size pieces of chorizo.  The best cooked eggs that I have ever had besides my Noni's.  The flavor in this dish is beyond good.  Perfect seasoning. Not runny or oily, just amazing.\n \ngolden and red beet salad: Great beet salad.  Nothing overpowering about this dish which made it a perfect.

Plus, it's open to the check-in desk and casino so it looks like more of a casual eatery than a fine dining establishment. It wasn't more than 75% full and we were seated right away at a table for two.\n\n//FOOD (from best to worst)//\n- Creamy risotto ($10.00): Cooked to a perfect al dente texture, wasn't mushy at all, wonderful flavors. I was craving more before we were even finished with the plate. Possibly the best risotto we've ever had.\n\n- Gambas ($12.00): It looked like a very simple dish. 4 shrimps in a broth that resembled clarified butter with garlic chips and peppers. It may not have been complex, but it was executed perfectly.\n\n- Piquillo peppers ($10.00): One pepper cut in half and stuffed with cheese and surrounded by a tomato based sauce. Loved it!\n\n- Tuna tiradito ($12.00): The tuna looked fabulous and tasted even better. It was accompanied by a terrific seaweed salad.\n\n- Steamed mussels ($9.00): Approximately a dozen large mussels in a medium sized black pot. Yes, the pot was deep so we had to really get in there to get some of that broth.  Delicious.\n\n- Beef with Brie ($17.00): Not the best cut of beef I've had but the flavors with the sauce, brie and toast were pretty good. If they timed the dishes better I would probably give this dish higher marks. But they brought out the tuna and risotto at the same time and by the time we tried the beef it was luke warm and the toast  wasn't crispy.\n\n- Lobster & pineapple ($14.00): Others rave about this dish, but I was underwhelmed. Too much pineapple, not enough lobster. It was too sweet and I could barely distinguish any other flavors other than the pineapple. More style than substance, in my opinion. \n\nOne thing that really bothered me was the seating. Her seat was on a bench. Mine was a poorly designed modern chair that was about 4 inches lower than the bench and the back support only went half way up my back making it tough to get comfortable.

I have no idea what the bill cost, but I'm sure it would have been over $50 pp.  \n\nThe food itself was nothing special - I've had much better tapas here in LA at various places.  I'll only gloss over the highlights.  I read that the chicken croquettes were to die for, but I found them to be simply good but something that wouldn't generally stand out.  The stuffed dates wrapped in bacon were excellent (though I must point out that it's difficult to get this dish wrong), the creamy risotto was super delicious, the scallops were good, the pan manchego was tasty, the peppers were a favorite of others, and out of all the desserts, the Spanish creme brulee was the best (unfortunately I have no picture of it, but it was larger than most creme brulees).  Again, most of the other dishes were average and nothing to write home about.  Oh, and the Sangria is delicious and sweet - they add some liquor to it (rum I think but I'm not sure) so it doesn't have a strong wine taste to it.\n\nThere's definitely better restaurants on the strip, though this was my first experience in Vegas eating tapas.  I'd say the tapas run on the more expensive side (most are $8 - $16, some up to $30), and we had to order a lot to get full.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Oh. My. Gods. \n\nWhat a delicious meal. A group of 3 of us shared a white sangria, mixed ceviche, fried calamari, and mixed paella. Everything was amazing. \n\nThe sangria was so light and fruity. An excellent compliment to the meal. \n\nThe ceviche looks small, but it sure packs a punch of flavor. I believe it included octopus, shrimp, and white fish...I can't be sure. Either way, it was amazing. The textures were great, and the combination of citrus with a touch of red pepper felt like fireworks on my palette. So good. \n\nWhen the waiter suggested calamari, I wasn't expecting anything too exciting, since you can get it just about anywhere. What a pleasant surprise this was. It was so very lightly breaded, so you could really taste the meat. Also, squirting lemon and then a hint of the aioli dipping sauce really created amazing flavors. It was a really delightful treat. \n\nFinally, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, the mixed paella. It includes lobster (both claws and the tail), chicken, chorizo, vegetables, and saffron rice. Wow. It was hard not to stuff ourselves silly with this. Everything about it was amazing. It was pricey, but I would order it again in a heartbeat...I would actually say that about the other items as well. It will be hard to return and try new things, when I know how fantastic the other items are. \n\nSo, with such great food, why 4 stars? I took off a star for the service. Or server wasn't that great...he kept approaching at inappropriate times, and then when we were clearly ready to make our order, he was nowhere to be found. He did suggest the calamari though. Also, when we ordered the paella, he asked if the 3 of us would be eating it...and I believe he thought we wanted a larger order of it...not sure, it was a bit of a miscommunication that led to the paella costing $20 more than the listed price. It wasn't a huge problem, however, I wish it would have been made clear when we ordered it that we were getting a larger order that would be more pricey. \n\nAll-in-all it was a delicious experience and I will definitely return.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I was quite underwhelmed with this restaurant, the service and the food.

Their small plates concept plus reasonable prices (way less than the other famous-chef restaurants at the Aria) was one reason, but the amazing flavors was the other.   My friend had the Meditteranean soup both nights because she loved it so much.

Next night I had the Red Sangria ($9.) and two starters that killed: Skewered \"Molecular\" Raspberry (a jelled delight) atop a square of Sesame Seared Ahi Tuna with Wasabi Salt, and my absolute favorite - Fresh Anchovies atop two warm olive-oiled Italian toasts with a little thin-sliced Piquillo Peppers.   We followed with a shared Lamb Chops dish - this included Thick Sliced Potatoes topped with Onions that had been cooked Confit-Style in oil and each mouthful was gorgeous.  The Chops - two to an order $28, which we split, sat on three great sauces - one seemed like a Bechamel, the other a Demi-Glace, and a very green olive oil garnished them.

I wanted that incredible flavor profile and excellent textures on the plates; however, the beef tapas, for example, was all soft with no counterpart, and the avocado cannoli was all creamy.  In terms of flavor, everything was seasoned as a restaurant of that caliber should do, but in terms of exciting my palette and making me say \"mmm\", it didn't even come close to a small smolder.\n\nFor us, the only great part of the evening involved their Santiago cake dessert served with turron ice cream was outstanding.  Talk about textures and flavors!  The cake was thick, moist, and had just the right sweetness to it.

Wow...is all I have to say.\n\nAtmosphere - It's very open and attractive.  The only drawback are these weird black trees without leaves.  Maybe I'm missing the artistic creation of them, but I felt like they were out of place.  There were mounds of fresh veggies on the backsplash - which was really refreshing to see.  Some time was really spent on the floors here.  Tiny tiles in a variety of colors...yellows, oranges, pinks, purples, pearly white.  And it had a pattern to it that was really intricate.  Bonus points for design.  \n\nI am a big fan of smaller tables and more intimate seating when going on a date.  Here, the tables are a bit larger, but they have to be because it is tapas style and you have tons of plates coming out, and then wine glasses...you get the drift.  \n\nPurple napkins.  Stellar.  \n\nOur sommelier came over and we mistakenly thought him as the waiter.  Oops.  He wasn't phased though so based off what we ordered he suggested a wine.  A half bottle in case we didn't like it.  What we didn't know, and d-bag sommelier didn't tell us, is the wine was 990 for a half bottle!!  I'm sorry, but if you expect your patrons to have 990 for a half bottle of wine without running it by them, I find it offensive.  Whether or not we could afford it, is really none of his biz, he should have been more polite to just give us the low down on that.  Fortunately for him the half bottle was amazing (it should be for almost a grand!).  Point of the story, for all those who cannot afford a grand on wine - BE SURE TO CHECK PRICE POINT when sommelier suggests a wine.  A professional one should let you know (discretely if you don't want to offend your date) and I just found that a little obnoxious.  I didn't know until the bill came, and neither did my beau...which was a bit shocking.\n\nAnyway...have the bacon wrapped dates.  Salty, sweet, savory goodness.  Chewy without too much chewy.  I almost died.\n\nI even tried the lobster with pinneapple.  Pretty good, and I'm not a seafood fan AT ALL.  This was something someone would like if they don't really appreciate seafood.\n\nWe also had the beet salad with what I though was lychee.  I said \"this tastes like Hawaii in my mouth\" and the waitress came over and explained it was pineapple gelatin.  Kudos for my palate being expanded.\n\nStuffed peppers and gosh I don't even know what to tell you because everything was soooo delightful.  It was romantic because we were both feeding each other, and so filling at the same time.  We had about 6 plates and everything was perfectly paced, our wine was superb (we had two half bottles, the second was of something different).  Fortunately the waiter showed my date the price for the second bottle.\n\nThe pan manchego...it's like that saying \"once you go manchego, you never go back\".  Crazy good.\n\nWe had churros for dessert that comes with some chocolate sauce for dipping.  The chocolate sauce had a hint of some kind of hot pepper (which was a little bit too much for me) but it was good in small quantity.  This is the best churro I have had in my life.  I was soooo full but kept eating it.  We also ordered the creme brule (because I love creme brule)...I wasn't so much a fan.  It was too eggy and not enough sugary.  The consistency was off for me.  Plus it was HUGE!  I like smaller versions of creme brule since it is sooo heavy.  Still, pretty fantastic.  I just wasn't a fan of the consistency.\n\nIt truly was an amazing experience.  Every time we put something in our mouths we just giggled and had our eyes roll back in our head how fantastic it truly was.  It blew my mind.  It blew Joe's mind and his wallet...I don't think he minded too much because it was TRULY that good.\n\nI had to amend and give it four stars because of our sommelier.

Apparently, I drained all his memory power, but thats what happens when you assume we will have had enough food when our paella arrives:)\n\nChef Nathan mentioned  that they had hired a cook from Peru who takes care of the ceviche action and Peruvians make some of the tastiest ceviches ever! Just the perfect heat and acidity mixed  into chunks of fish and octopus served with crisp taro chips, very cool and refreshing.\n\nThe Lobster and Molecular Pineapple skewers were quite tasty with an asian accent as well, definitely a must try.\n\nThe Crema y Risotto was the star of the tapas. The risotto was cooked perfectly al dente, the earthy meatiness of the mushrooms paired well as always with the truffle oil, cream, and cheese, and transformed my wife into a risotto lover.\n\nThe Julian Serrano version of Stuffed Dates have a crispy exterior and is paired with a piquillo pepper sauce with a good kick.

If you're not a big fan of reading reviews here is the Cliff's notes version: Go!\n\nIf you want details here they are:\n\nI should preface this review by saying that I studied abroad in Spain for four months. I lived with a Spanish host family and ate homemade Spanish food 2-3 meals a day. I've had it homemade, in restaurants, in at least 10 different Spanish cities and in America. I can be very picky about Spanish food and on the whole find the current tapas craze to be slightly annoying; don't get me started on over-priced, fussy restaurants calling themselves \"tapas bars.\"\n\nThe menu at Julian Serrano can be divided into two groups: traditional Spanish food and contemporary Spanish inspired gastronomy in the mold of elBulli or Bazaar - but certainly not in their price range. The traditional dishes are delicious and 100% authentic. Each bite made me made me more nostalgic for Spain. The contemporary dishes are inventive and playful.\n \nAs a tapas bar you are encouraged to try everything that piques your interest, so I tasted a lot of dishes. I'll list them by rating on the customary yelp 5 star scale. Foreshadowing: most are 5s.\n\n\n5 stars:\nSangria - Excellent. It's so hard to find well-made sangria outside Spain. You need to use an intense, acidic Spanish wine. Most sangria is doomed from the start because people pick wine that is already sweet and fruity. Serrano got it perfect: earthy, slightly sour, not overly sweet, completely refreshing.\nPatatas Bravas\nStuffed Piquillo Peppers\nWhite Ceviche\nTortilla - It is my opinion that a Spanish restaurant's tortilla can tell you everything you need to know about the restaurant. Serrano's tortilla is excellent.\nTuna Tiradito - Ahi with ponzu and seaweed. Far from Spanish but still amazing.\nBeef and Cheese\nStuffed Dates\nDeconstructed seafood soup - Ask when you go. Your waiter will be happy to explain the dish and its \"deconstruction.\"\nChurros con chocolate - I'm certain this dish is incredibly high in fat, sugar, and fat again. I'm also certain that it is totally worth it.\n\n4 stars\nLobster Pineapple Skewers\nPan Manchengo\n\n\n3 stars\nPaella Marinera - Good but not excellent. Considering how delicious the tapas were I wish we had ordered more tapas and gone without paella.\nOlives - The only thing left on the table. I was sad because I LOVE olives and Spanish olives are some of the best in the world. These were marinated with some spices I wasn't able to identify. I like them plain.\nAlmond cake with turron ice cream - Hi, my name is Jay and I'm a recovering turron ice cream ADDICT. When I lived in Spain I would sometimes eat it twice a day. I was excited to get my fix again but found Serrano's version to be lacking in intensity.\n\nThe service was excellent. Our waiter was attentive, helpful, and talkative without being intrusive. When we wanted to order more tapas all we had to do was look up and someone was ready to take our order. Not one minute after realizing I had nowhere to put my ahi without getting salsa brava on it, our plates were changed. My only complaint was that the waiter asked if we wanted more sangria/desserts/coffee several times, even after we had ordered them. It was a minor annoyance in an otherwise perfect performance from the wait staff.\n\nThe atmosphere is more casual than I expected. The hostess said shorts and a T shirt were fine, but I dressed up slightly anyway. Other diners' attire ranged from jeans to suits. Like most of the dishes the d\u00e9cor is simple and beautiful. Colored mosaic-style tiles cover the walls. The space is very open; the restaurant is separated from the casino by waist-high glass panels. I was afraid noise from the casino would be a problem but once we were seated I didn't even notice the casino.\n\nMy only serious complaints were regarding the wine list. Their prices seemed high, even by fine dining standards. The wine list isn't available online - although the menu is - and when I asked if they could email it to me they said I'd have to email the sommelier and that he doesn't like sending it out.\n\nThe prices for food are very reasonable, almost cheap by Vegas standards. Paella, 12 tapas, a pitcher of sangria (about 8 glasses), 2 desserts, tax, and tip was 268. I tipped 20% - the wait staff had certainly earned it. The amount of food was sufficient for 4 guys with large appetites. Most parties of 4 would probably have thought the amount of food we ordered indecent.\n\nIf you've read this far you clearly are giving a lot of thought to your Vegas dining options.

The dining area is clean & pristine with a bright color scheme.  I sat at the bar and service was attentive.  Tried 3 items : \n*Pan manchego - toasted bread, tomato sauce, aged manchego \nTerrific flavor.  Simple but encompasses the flavors, temperatures & textures I was looking for\n\n*Spanish chicken croquetas ( aka tentadora )\nChicken & bechamel \nI hoped and prayed this would be the star of show.  I pretended to continue reading my paper but I obsessed about these little nuggets of heaven once I saw them on the menu.  Damn it if it wasn't just my luck.... Disappointment! The crunch and outer texture was heavenly. The bechamel and chicken filling though left me wondering what I had done in a past life to deserve such a tease.   From now on I will refer to these croquetas as the temptress or since it's a Spanish restaurant -  Tentadora\n\nSerrano Rice\nChorizo, chicken, rabbit, Frito, saffron\nFinal dish ordered and it ended on a high note.  All proteins were full of flavor and the sofrito was bold but not overwhelming.  \n\nMid-meal I decided to order a glass of red sangria ( maybe to drown my sorrows from the above listed temptress ).

However unlike the borderline molecular deconstructionist gastronomy of the Bazaar, the items of JS are a little more conventional and accessible, but no less delicious.\n\nI started off with the avocado cannelloni which was salmon tartare wrapped with sliced avocado with japanese seaweed salad.  I enjoyed this from the first bite as flavours of the salmon, avocado were mixed with a pleasant amount of saltiness. I could have ordered another one of these to finish off my meal.  Next I tried the salmon & truffle dish which was a good but a little dissapointing as the wonderful truffle sauce seemed to clash with otherwise bland and familiar salmon taste, not really infusing into the meat of the fish.  Perhaps pairing the truffle flavour with a different fish would work better.  Rounding out the meal was the Valenciana paella rice with chicken, rabbit, chorizo and saffron rice, very nice indeed.  Luckily I ordered off the lunch menu which was smaller portions but also only half the price of the dinner menu item.\n\nPrices are a bit up there to be honest, but not surprising given small plates usually tend to be pricy and given the premium real estate, but for those who are comfortable spending the extra dime on some quality cooking and intriguing flavours, JS is a nice place to check out.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Kudos to the staff at Julian Serrano for making accommodations for large party.

I called in advance to find out about parking and such, as this area is known for lousy parking. The newspaper has complained about the limited local parking. I called the concierge and she told me for locals, to use the NORTH VALET off HARMON. She said it avoids the tourists and all the hectic business of people trying to figure out the front of the City Center complex. She said if you want to park, try the second floor of the self park as all of the tourists fight for the first floor. The NORTH VALET PARKING IS COMPLEMENTARY. In any sense, going back to the food, I asked the concierge for a recommendation and that I was bringing along my 8 year old son. She recommended a place called Julian Serrano. She said where else could you get a great sandwich for $10 and for the kids, you can order off the tapas menu for some deep fried chicken.  I asked for her recommendation for Todd English's pub and she said to stick with Julian Serrano for lunch.  \n\nGreat recommendation. \nWe each ordered a sandwich. I had the chorizo, the other two were the mixed sandwich and the vegetarian. The Chorizo ciabatta sandwich was good, with not spicy, but evenly balanced against the goat cheese spread. My mother said the vegetarian ciabatta was eggplant, mushroom & pesto, with the mushroom overpowering the rest of the ingredients.  She really liked the ciabatta bread.  My father had the mixed and I took a picture of it. He said it was good. It had a fried egg with Serrano ham and cheese on plain bread, and they cut a hole out of the bread to showcase the fried egg. The best part of the sandwich combo is the fries that accompany it. My son had the SPANISH CHICKEN CROQUETTAs, (great photos from others already posted.) He loved them as did he enjoy my french fries which came with my sandwich. The FRENCH FRIES were skinny, twice fried potatoes. They were the best. We also had an AVOCADO CANNELLONI from the tapas menu. It was thinly shaved avocado wrapping a lightly vinegar-ed salad of Japanese seaweed, sesame, and smoked salmon. The seaweed salad overpowered the avocado, but it was something that I could say \"I CAN'T MAKE THIS AT HOME\" because of the delicateness of the consistently sliced ripe avocado the rolled and wrapped the seaweed salad.  Other yelp fans have posted this picture.  It's a beautiful presentation that lacks any taste outside of vinegar & seaweed.\n\nAll in all, the concierge's recommendations for lunch were SPOT ON! Where else can you get a gourmet sandwich and fries for $10. My son's chicken was like $9 from the tapas menu. I was going to order some sherry, but the wine prices were outrageous, so we had water which seemed (table to table) like the most common lunch drink served. \n\nMy recommendations: They have 6 or 7 sandwiches to choose from for lunch, all for $10.

Doesn't just taste like watered down red wine.  My husband got a glass of white wine, the Albarino ($9) which was good but a little sweet for my tastes.  I like dry white wine.\n\nWe went a little nuts and got three tapas!  I was really intrigued by the salmon truffle ($12) which is a piece of salmon with bechamel truffle sauce atop a portabello mushroom.  This was actually disappointingly ok.  Maybe I was all truffled out from the truffle fritters at Jean Georges but this dish just didn't do much for me.\n\nWe also got the oysters ($10) which the server said could be served with a mango foam or traditional.  This was confusing because the menu said gazpacho foam.  We went for the mango foam, but when we got them, it was definitely gazpacho foam.  Either way, they were very good and fresh.  The oysters come in servings of 4.\n\nFinally we got the pata negra ($35), which we always get here.  Now it is ham, some bread, and a tomato sauce, which may be a little offputting given the price.  But this is famous blackhoofed pig and only comes from Spain.  The ham is cured for 3 years and it is just so yummy.  The tomato sauce, which appears to be fresh tomatoes and olive oil, goes perfectly with the ham.\n\nA good experience but I was disappointed by the salmon so I'll drop off a star.  Plus, they got slammed towards the end of our meal (our server actually exclaimed out loud about being slammed, so it must have been bad) and it took a while to get the check.  No biggie.

With plate after plate after plate arriving and filling the table I asked Adrian why this was happening and suggested slowing things down to which he responded \"this is a tapas restaurant, sir, it is how things are served.\"  Having already assured himself a lousy tip by this point I explained to him that although I've never been to Spain I have been to a multitude of Andres and Garces spots, plus other \"tapas\" style restaurants and have never seen anything like this.  Without apology I watched him amble off to the kitchen where he actually stopped two servers carrying plates (they would have been numbers 8 and 9 on the table at once) and after this service did improve, mildly.\n\nPlate six was Mediterranean stew in deconstruction | prawns | bronzinni | sofrito, the first of the more \"modern\" tapas.  Familiar with European seabass I think the cut we received was a bit close to the tail and the fish's generally sweet taste was much brinier than expected.  With the prawn slightly overcooked and rubbery the seafood on the plate was fortunately brought up a notch by pur\u00e9ed sweet potato and \"sofrito\" of garlic, olive oil, tomato, and onion.  Taking bites of everything mixed did indeed harken to a seafood stew, but not an exceptional one in any way.\n\nThe final plate in the first (self limited) wave was the best \"modern\" tapas of the meal - tuna-raspberry skewer | ahi tuna | \"molecular\" raspberry | wasabi | sesame seed.  At $14 the portion/price ratio was poor, but the flavors and quality more than made up for it.  With the \"molecular\" aspect a similar texture to a gelee, the sweetness of the raspberry was nicely tempered by the heat of the wasabi while the pan seared tuna coated in sesame seeds lent heft and crunch to the dish.  At the same time visually appealing, texturally intriguing, and tasty this was the sort of dish I had expected when walking into Julian Serrano, though I'd have personally preferred sashimi style from the fish.\n\nThe second dish, Wild mushroom soup | shiitake | crimini | oyster | foie gras cream would prove to be another excellent classic dish spruced up with modern technique.  Similar to my favorite mushroom soup of all time (Canoe's creamless Mushroom soup) but topped off with foam featuring the unctuous sapor of foie gras.  Taken on its own the soup itself was hearty, earthy, and minimally sweet - the cream simply added a whole extra layer of flavor.  This, along with the subsequent dish would prove my favorite of the meal.\n\nOverlooked by myself but ordered by my mother, Creamy risotto | wild mushroom | manchego cheese | natural jus was the steal of the menu at a mere $10.  With a base of flawless rice cooked in mushroom broth the dish found heft in the addition of creamy mushroom broth (quite similar in flavor to that on the salmon) while slices of fibrous mushroom added textural variety.  Topped with a slice of slowly melting year-old manchego that added its characteristic aged salinity the entirety of the dish was flawless - I was especially thankful to receive this in the second wave of dishes as I imagine it would not have been as successful in the cooled state.\n\nWhere the tuna skewers succeeded, Lobster-pineapple skewer | lobster tail | \"molecular\" pineapple | sesame oil failed.  Whether it was the small portions of overcooked lobster or the over sweetened and disconcertingly fibrous pineapple gelee I cannot be certain, but the dish was simply unbalanced and any nuance that may have been intended was lost in the sweetness.  As the final fish dish of the night I'll simply say that aside from the octopus the kitchen at Serrano really needs to pay attention to the textures coming out of the kitchen as nearly every fish was overcooked.\n\nTax and moderate tip included the total cost of the meal turned out to be ~$55/person - not a bad deal considering the fact that we ordered four dishes per person and did not pick based on price.  With that said, when a chef like Serrano attaches his name to something there is an expectation that follows and that expectation was not met.  Overcooked fishes, muddled flavor profiles, and service gaffs (especially the sort where the server tells the diner he/she is wrong) have no place in such restaurants and considering the superstar competition that just arrived in town with two restaurants at The Cosmopolitan these are the sorts of mistakes that could send diners looking for better.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 4, "useful": 5, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "We went for lunch, and got some tapas.

The decor reminds me a little bit of the Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill in MGM Grand in how the restaurant is very much open to the casino and the hotel.  There are no big and thick walls separating the dining area from the nearby bustling activity of the casino.\n\nThe decor is very upscale cafe-like and hotel restaurant-like.  Nice and contemporary but pretty standard stuff (not unique or memorable).\n\nWe had a few things here and I felt the food looked better than it tasted.  Several of the dishes were average.  I was not a big fan of Fleur by Hubert Keller (a tapas spot in Mandalay Bay), but I felt Fleur was noticeably better than Julian Serrano.\n\nHere is a rundown on what we had.\n\n(Ahi Tuna Tempura) This was ahi tuna two ways.  There was a standard ahi tuna tower on the plate that had an avocado base (fresh and a good flavor but something you will find at a lot of other restaurants).\n\nThere was also ahi tuna that was flash fried in a light tempura batter (crispy on the outside but still rare on the inside).  This was okay and I liked the contrast of the cool center with the crisp outside.  Still, I've had a much better version of that dish at Ocean Avenue Seafood in Santa Monica.\n\n(Mediterranean Bass)  This was a bass with the skin-on that was served over some veggies with a light sauce.  It was a light dish and had a mild flavor.  The fish was pretty moist (the skin could have been crisper).\n\n(Cheese Platter) The cheese selection at Fleur was much better.  The cheese here was a little dry (not great flavors either).  The garnishes were also disappointing.  The fruit paste was too thick and lacked sweetness.\n\n(Chicken Skewers) The chicken skewers here were juicy enough, but they lacked flavor.\n\n(Prime Tenderloin Topped With Cheese, Honey And Pecans) The quality of beef was really poor (at least when compared to the other dishes we had here). The beef was a thin piece.  They overcooked it  (it came out well) and it was dry and chewy.  The cheese, honey and pecans were all fine, but the centerpiece of the dish (beef) was a real disappointment.\n\n(Stuffed Dates) The dates here were wrapped in bacon and then deep-fried.  This is a pretty popular combination and their version of it was pretty tasty (though kind of a given with this flavor combination).\n\nService was okay.  Food came out at a good pace and the staff was attentive enough, but I felt the wait staff was not as strong as what I experienced at other Vegas spots recently (including Fleur, Mesa Grill, Comme Ca, Bouchon, and Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill).\n\nI've been fortunate enough to have a lot of service where it felt the wait staff was really putting in the extra effort to make every aspect of the dining experience enjoyable and memorable.  While the wait staff was pleasant enough, I did not get that same feeling here.\n\nJulian Serrano sounds like it would be a nice place.  The menu reads nice as well.  There were mostly misses here though and the food was just not as good as other Vegas spots I've tried in the same price range.  I will give a lot of places a second try, but since we had so many dishes and so many were average, I doubt I would return here.\n\nAria features complimentary valet parking.

While it was my Birthday lunch which might cloud my vision a little, our waiter and the whole staff truly made my meal here one I shall remember fondly until the end of my days.\n\nMy wife and I walked in last Friday at around noon.   While we had no reservation, the staff greeted us kindly nevertheless and sat us near a TV, as I was following the Villanova - George Mason NCAA basketball game.  Our waiter approached us immediately and suggested we try the sangria.  It being my Birthday, I happily obliged him and I had in fact 3 of them by the time the meal was done.   Let me tell you right now the drink was crisp and very tasty and left absolutely no headache later on (something Sangria is typically notorious for in that regard)\n\nAs far as food is concerned, we started out with the Spanish Charcuterie Platter, Fried Calamari, White Ceviche and Crispy Pancetta Iberica.   Of those 4 dishes, the Fried Calamari came out on top, followed by the White Ceviche.   The Charcuterie platter was delightful too, while I must say we were not blown away by the Pork Belly (Pancetta) dish.\n\nWe followed up these dishes with 3 more tapas:  Stuffed Piquillo Peppers, the spanish chicken croquetas, and the Flat Iron Steak.   The first 2 were absolutely divine.   The third one was just so-so.\n\nBy that point, both my wife and I were absolutely stuffed.   Still, the waiter would not relent on us getting dessert, especially after he heard my wife was a Pastry Chef and it was my Birthday.   We nevertheless declined dessert, being completely full at that point.   Still, the waiter brought us a Crema Catalana on the house.   Since the dish was there, we had to eat it and indeed it was one of the best Creme Brulees (my wife's expected, of course) that I've ever had.   The dessert is served with a pineapple sorbet which is so clean and beautiful that it tastes like you are biting into an icy wedge of Hawaiian Pineapple.\n\nSimply amazing dining experience.

Magnificent. The seafood was delicious, with great variation in texture from one meat to another. I tell you, I ate the red onion...on purpose...simple because it was in the broth. I hate red onion. So this is a major compliment. I almost ordered another one.\n\nThat was followed by the poorly named \"beef and cheese\" which is actually a tenderloin medallion cooked medium rare, topped with a slice of good brie, in a honey sauce with pecans sprinkled over top. The sauce did not over power, the nuts were a nice add, and the beef was cooked just right with incredible flavor. Really delicious. I also ordered some of the wild mushroom risotto, which, while it was actual risotto, was actually just a tad underdone for my taste. It did have nice big pieces of mushroom, as well as a nice slice of manchego cheese - I actually could have done with more cheese, as the umami sets off the earthy mushrooms well.\n\nFinally, molten chocolate cake with blood orange ice cream, ordered on the basis of that ice cream alone. Unfortunately, it really was not very distinguishable from orange sherbet when it arrived. Perhaps if it had been a sorbet. It didn't have the strong dark flavor I associate with blood orange...I think I was really hoping for a sorbet, with a cleaner taste. The cake itself was good, very dense and very rich. Also came out very hot - I almost burned my tongue.\n\nIn the end, I'm happy about this recommendation.

A bit pricier than other tapas places I've been, but hey, it's Vegas; nothing comes cheap.\n\nThe restaurant looks kinda like a transparent enclave of the Aria, which can make this spot a perfect place to people-watch as you eat, if you get a good spot. We had a wonderful waiter who made suggestions that were spot-on and made sure that we had a good dining experience.

We came here for lunch on a Saturday around 1 pm because my mom has been on a tapas kick lately and we had heard this place was good. The decor was very hip and attractive, just like the Aria itself. We had a reservation so we didn't wait, bit about 30 minutes after we sat down, a line started to form outside. \n\nFood: 5\nThe food was absolutely delicious.  There was not one dish I didn't like. The Brava potatoes were perfectly fried and crispy, and covered in a red sauce and garlic aioli.  My only complaint about the presentation is that it was served in a small bowl, so that the bottom pieces were soggy when we reached them. Serving this on a plate with the sauces on the side would be better.  The lobster gazpacho was cool and refreshing, and came with some chunks of lobster meat, minced tomatoes, cucumbers and bell peppers, and a frozen ball of the soup on a spoon (very fancy!).  Dad ordered the Pinxto de chorizos with garlic mashed potato, which were so tasty (but not healthy at all).  The chorizo was flavored perfectly, and the mashed potatoes complemented them well.  the fried calamari was not very crispy, but the squid was so tender and lightly breaded, so the flavor made up for the lack of normal calamari texture.  We also ordered the seafood ceviche and the sardines (I didn't eat them so I can't comment, but my parents enjoyed them immensely).  We had the salted Marcona Almonds, and they were good, but i wouldn't order them again ($6 for almonds is a bit much). \n\nWe enjoyed our food with a pitcher of white sangria, which was STRONG and delicious and perfect for sipping in between bites.  It was not oversweet, and came with big, pretty chunks of green apple, lime, and orange.  Mom started skewering the apples out of the pitcher with her fork and eating them when the sangria was all gone :)\n\nFor me, the star of the meal was the dessert: churros with spicy hot chocolate!  These were not your typical Mexican-American cinnamon churros - they were only slightly sweet and dusted with powdered sugar, light, fluffy, formed into little teardrop-shaped loops, and served with a cup of melted dark chocolate with a spicy kick and a chili pepper for decoration.

So far, I most enjoy the salmon with truffle(I often order two) and some other seafood dish I cannot presently recall.

Prior to coming, we studied the menu and got a few ideas about what we wanted to order. Our first visit was for dinner one evening, and we decided to try their $39 prix fixe menu with the $19 wine pairing.\n\nEverything about the meal and service was outstanding! We had a few questions about the food and possible substitutions for dessert, and what our waiter couldn't answer immediately, he quickly found out and was very helpful.\n\nFor the appetizer round, my partner and I shared the Brava Potatoes and the Stuffed Piquillo Peppers. Such simple items, but oh so delicious. The potatoes are topped with a mildly spicy bravas sauce and an alioli; when combined with the crispy potatoes, it's a perfect bite! The piquillo peppers were equally delicious. Although they're a bit small, they pack a huge punch in each bite. I'm not a fan of mushrooms, but they were blended so well with the goat cheese that it made for a delicious two or three bite dish. The waiter paired a refreshing Riesling with this course and it was the perfect accompaniment. \n\nThe entree round brought me the Organic Pork Chop with pisto serrano and a dijon mustard sauce, which was topped with thin, crispy-fried wonton crisps. My partner had the seasonal fish, which was a perfectly cooked salmon, with a side of sauteed spinach with raisins, apples, and pine nuts all topped with a buttery garlic sauce. Both dishes were cooked perfectly, but the pork chop was the standout. The dijon sauce was drool-worthy and each bite of the chop with the pisto serrano and the wonton crisps was moan-inducing. I don't usually enjoy fish, but the bite of salmon I had was very good (perfect for fish-lovers, I'm sure). We had a delicious Cava paired with this course and it complemented the dishes well.\n\nThere were three great options for dessert on the $39 menu, but we spotted the churros with a spicy chocolate dipping sauce on the $59 menu and thought we'd ask if we could substitute. Our waiter made it possible, and we could not have been more pleased. Who doesn't love a good, crispy fried churro and a spicy chocolate sauce?! He paired a sweet Sherry (Hidalgo - Pedro Jiminez) with this course and it was the perfect pairing. With each dip of the churro in the sauce, you could pick up a faint hint of the spice in the chocolate, but when you took a sip of the sherry - WOW! The sherry was so good. The hint of raisin and almond with a buttery sweet finish was the perfect coupling with the spicy-sweet fried goodness. \n\nThe atmosphere here was great as well. You're still close enough to the casino to people-watch (if that's what you like), but it's also private enough to have a quiet meal. We were seated at one of the tables connected to the bar, which was right next to two of the kitchens where we could watch all the delicious tapas coming out. The setting is casual enough where you can come in from a day walking the strip and sit down for a great meal.\n\nOverall, this was the best place we ate at while in Vegas. So much so, that we decided to have it for lunch the day we left (see below for details). Do yourself a favor and go to Julian Serrano now. You won't be disappointed.\n\n********\n\nUPDATE: Our experience the night before at another Aria restaurant was awful, so we decided to return to Julian Serrano for lunch before leaving Vegas. This time, we opted to select a few different tapas to share. Again, the service was great and we got another table near the kitchen so we could see all the delicious food coming out. Since this visit was more about trying the different tapas, here's what we had:\n\n- Golden and Red Beet Salad: Delightfully delicious, earthy and refreshing. I never had beets before, but this was a great introduction to that earthy root. The beets were paired with frisee, citrus fruits (lime, orange and grapefruit) and molecular pineapple. There's a perfectly sweet beet syrup on the bottom that marries well with the whole salad.\n\n- Warm Goat Cheese Salad: This was light and refreshing as well - a good dish to prep your palate for the more heartier dishes to come. \n\n- Traditional Spanish Chicken Croquetas: Yum! Yum! Yum! Delicately fried and filled with chicken and a scrumptious bechamel sauce, these bites are not to be missed. Four come to an order.\n\n- Stuffed Dates: Having made these at home, we could appreciate the time-consuming effort these little meat candies take to prepare. The dates are stuffed with goat cheese (I think) and an almond, then wrapped in bacon for a perfectly sweet and savory bite. The piquillo pepper sauce on the side was a nice surprise. Mildly spicy, which was a great addition to the sweetness of the dates. Four of these come to an order as well. \n\n- Huevos Estrellados: We were on the brunch side of lunch, so this was a great dish. Crispy french fries topped with eggs and chorizo - a nice and hearty finish to a perfect meal.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 3, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "The tapas were all fine, but nothing to write home about.

That's nearly double what I normally spend but on occasion, I like to splurge and enjoy a more upscale meal in a setting 100% more luxurious than local favorite Firefly.\n\nFOOD: You get what you pay for. My favorites at Firefly are stuffed dates, shrimp ceviche, and lamb skewers. I've tried each of their counterparts at Serrano. And I have to admit that they do each one better. The flavors are more complex and refined. The dates are melt-in-your-mouth good. The quality of meat (in this case lamb) at Serrano is more tender and less game-y. I've tried all of the ceviches here and each and every one is extremely fresh and flavorful. Firefly's ceviche tends to be a little heavy on the lemon and on occasion I'll get a fishy one. I tend to order more seafood at Serrano as well. I feel like all the hot seafood tapas I've ordered here are spot on. Some of the best seafood dishes I've eaten in Vegas--period.\n\nSANGRIA: I'm sorry Serrano, but I have to say Firefly does this one better. I don't doubt for a second that there's a lot involved in making the sangria here. But there's something so familiar and delicious about the red wine sangria at Fireflys. The delicate balance of fruit and wine flavor has been perfected. And hey, you can't beat the 50% off pitchers of Sangria during Firefly Happy Hour.\n\nSERVICE: In a fine dining setting, I'm very particular about my service.

Julian Serrano is a tapas restaurant located in the lobby of the Aria Hotel next to the front desk.  The restaurant is decorated in vivid colors and is enclosed by a short clear divider that leaves part of the restaurant exposed to the eyes of lobby guests.  Since the divider is only a few feet tall and clear, I think that the people who dine at these tables get a more casual atmosphere since it almost feels like you are dining in the lobby itself.  However, the rest of the tables are tucked further back into the restaurant giving it a more private and cozy atmosphere.  \n\nI have been here a few times and the people who dine here have always ranged from extremely casual (\"Hi, I just came from the pool\") to dressed to impress (\"I'm going to the cluuuuub!\").

The good thing is that the ambiance can really accommodate anyone, and the restaurant is spacious enough that you can sit far away from small children if you prefer.  \n\nThe service has always been excellent - no complaints there.

I ordered it when I was with a party of 10 girls - 4 of us really wanted paella, and the menu said that the portions are designed for 2 people.

It is an upscale fine dining restaurant that features Spanish tapas (or sharing plates). Simone and I arrived in our finest t-shirts, shorts and sneakers. Although not exactly dressed for a formal dinner, I let the hostess know I had made a reservation and we were quickly escorted past the rich and almost famous to the corner table at the far end of the dining room. Reservations are an absolute necessity if you plan to get a table at this restaurant (especially when dressed like a tourist from Maine).After being seated, our very formal waiter quickly offered us a very expensive wine menu and so we decided to get a diet soda and water ( from the tap). We looked over the menu and decided that we wanted to try the Paella as our entree that we would share. The Paella takes at least 35 minutes to prepare so we placed our order before deciding on our smaller tapas plates. First up we decided on a plate of marinated olives. When they arrived we realized that they were not pitted, so we had fun seeing who could make the biggest mess while trying to get the pits out. The waiter seemed amused by this. The olives were very good and were marinated in roasted garlic and baby onions. For our second tapas we decided to get more adventurous and ordered the Albondigas, which were mini Meatballs cooked in a Tomato and Sherry Sauce. They were some of the most tender meatballs I have ever eaten and they just melted in the mouth. The sauce was mild and light with a nice hint of sherry and also included some roasted baby potatoes.  Our last tapas choice was the new age Egg Potato & Morcilla dish. The dish was a combination of sauteed Wild Mushrooms and Blood Sausage with a soft poached egg, atop a pool of Potato Foam topped with Manchego Cheese Air. This dish was truly memorable and one of the most unique things I have ever eaten. The richness of the sausage and egg combined magicaly with the smokey earthiness of the mushrooms and the potato foam and Manchego air melted away to create a creamy sauce for it all. This dish was a real culinary adventure.  Our Valencia Paella was ready and came to the table piping hot and served in the cast iron pan it was cooked in. It was a delicious combination of baked Saffron laced Spanish rice with house made Chorizo sausage, sauteed Rabbit and tender grilled Chicken topped of with roasted Haricot Verde Green Beans.  We managed to finish off the rather large Paella meal, and then wrapped things up with a dessert tapas of Almond Sponge Cake with Homemade Almond Ice Cream.

The look of the place (inside the Aria Resort which is part of the City Center complex) is fantastic with some of the best restaurant chairs I've sat in. If you have back problems and are large, you know what I'm talking about. These chairs were generously padded with upper back support.\n\nMy partner and I ordered the four-course Signature Tasting menu. I got the wine pairing. The first course was a delightful mixed baby Romaine salad with walnuts, roasted peppers, and Cabrales cheese.  In a sign of things to come, my first wine pairing came while I was in the restroom. It was a full glass of champagne - way too much. I was gulping it but was only a third of the way when the next course came. Also, the pairing was weak - matching champage with a lively, flavorful salad seems lazy.  It simply did not match the inspiration of the salad.\n\nThe second course was the standout course - a creamy, wild mushroom risotto. The flavor was intense and earthy. I'd go back just for this course. However, my wine pairing showed up when I was midway through the risotto.  Once again the wine selection was mediocre.  A great wine pairing will play off the flavors of the food. This wine did nothing. Maybe the emphasis on all things Spanish didn't give the somolier enough room to operate.\n\nThe third course was where it all crashed. First, my partner received his course first (chicken wrapped around sausage) and was a third of the way through it before I received mine. My first bites of the pork chop were delicious but by the third bite I knew they had seriously overcooked it.  It got drier and drier as I got into it. To get a sense of how dry it was, I had to use a fair amount of force to get my fork into it! At this point, I brought my waiter over to tell her. I continued eating, she brought of the manager over who offered to cook another pork chop or substitute another course. This might make sense if I was eating alone but not with a show to catch or a partner sitting by while I wait for a new entree. This wine pairing was better but I was using anything available (including the leftover champage from the first course) to wash down the pork chop.\n\nThe manager came back to ask if there was anything else he could do.  I said no. The manager deducted half the cost of my tasting menu for our tab.  I might go back and try an ala carte/tapas approach.

The server then said, \"You know that's cold, don't you?\"  Do I look that much like a rube? (that's rhetorical!)  The gazpacho was excellent.  Great tomato flavor and there were several pieces of tasty lobster.\n\nCourse two was the creamy risotto with wild mushrooms and manchego cheese.

I want to say there are approximately 3 or 4 decently sized pieces. Great for a table of four! \n\n--Bunuelos de Bacalao: Essentially fried cod, but this fried cod was pretty tasty. It came with a nice potato puree that complimented the Atlantic cod quite nicely. If I had to pick between this and the tuna, though, I pick the Ahi Tuna every time. \n\n--Papas Bravas: Good potatoes, but I actually found this dish very boring. I wouldn't order it again. \n\n--Huevos Estrellados: Uses the above potatoes, but has Spanish chorizo and fried, runny egg mixed throughout to create an interesting, homogeneous mixture of egg, salty chorizo, and the potatoes. My dad LOVES this dish, but I found it semi-average, mostly because I don't like runny eggs! If you're a fan of that, then this dish is right up your alley. \n\n**--Stuffed Piquillo Peppers: OMG. I don't like pulling out the \"OMG\" card very often...but... OMG. These are so amazing. Maybe because I'm such a sucker for good goat cheese...and this has excellent goat cheese stuffed within the sliced peppers. I had never had a piquillo pepper before, and I'm kicking myself for wasting so many years not stuffing my face with these lovely red peppers. So delicious! \n\n**--Creamy Risotto: Consisting of wild mushrooms and aged manchego, mmmm. My mom orders this each time and I make sure to get my fair share. The manchego makes this item as good as it is. \n\n--Chicken Croquetas: Fried in the same way as a lightly breaded cheese stick (the only analogy I can think of). The base inside is a creamy Bechamel sauce. I can't remember too much about these otherwise. Still good! Give these a shot. \n\n**--Beef & Cheese: GETTT THISSSS. This may sound like the most unappetizing, boring name for a dish EVER; however, this is perhaps my favorite item we get each time. This was some of the most tender steak I've had in my years (and I've eaten at my fair share of steakhouses-- take a look at my review for SW Steakhouse at Wynn for my feelings about that!). \n\n--Pintxo de Chorizos: The pork was too tough for our liking...maybe we just caught them on a bad day. Skip this one unless you're a huge fan of marinated pork chorizo. We let our waiter know that we weren't big fans of this, and he took it away, and the manager came over and took it off the bill and apologized profusely. No worries, Neil Patrick Harris twin! (Seriously. This guy is a carbon copy of NPH). \n\n\nDESSERTS:\n(~View my picture uploads for a peek at these desserts)\n\n**--Churros: Served with a spicy chocolate sauce. Delicious churros. Being from the Southwest, I was a bit skeptical to try these...but my family loves Julian's take on churros! Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. Give these teardrop-shaped, fried pastries a try. \n\n--Flan: Creamy and over too liquid-y like some can be. Had a delicious fruit ensemble atop the flan with most berries. \n\n--Bunuelos: Pretty much like beignet donuts. We also enjoy these. Served with a butterscotch type of sauce...mm. I still prefer the churros, though! \n\nTIP: This place can get packed on weekend dinners. Call during the day for reservations. \n\nBottom line: I can't wait to go back to get my tapas fix.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "We stopped here two day's in a row.

We were comfortably fed, but frankly I could have continued eating. I would come again, but probably not for full dinner.\n\nWe had reservations and were seated right away, near the front open area, which was fine with us. There were open tables in back, we probably could have requested to be seated in a more private area if we wanted. Servers were attentive, made good recommendations when requested, explained each dish well, and kept our glasses full of both water and sangria. \n\nWe had (multiples of many for a table of 6):\n\n1 pitcher each, red and white sangria (both delicious! best I've ever had)\n*White Ceviche (great texture, lots of lime flavor, good portion size)\n*Seared Scallop (again, great texture, like butter, perfectly cooked, smallish portion, 1 scallop)\n*Stuffed Piquillo Peppers (a favorite of the night! ordered a second round, 2 peppers per plate)\n*Creamy Risotto (another best of the night! perfect texture and flavor, moderate portion size)\nBeef & Cheese (simple name for a tasty dish, good quality, cooked and seasoned well, not super spectacular though, moderate portion size)\nTuna Sashimi Cones (great quality, well balanced flavors, but not something I'll crave on its own, 3 cones per plate)\nFried Calamari (very good but pretty basic recipe, nothing I can't get elsewhere, moderate portion size)\nBrava Potatoes (crunchy outside, soft inside, tasty sauce, but still just potatoes, good portion size)\nSpanish Tortilla (misnomer - this is not a tortilla, more like a potato layered quiche. tasty but nothing special - needed more salt, moderate portion size)\n\nAnd for dessert we had the Churros and Spicy Chocolate sauce. I was a little disappointed with this dish after the rave reviews on Yelp. It was good, but I would have preferred more cinnamon on the churro, and it was a little too crunchy, in my opinion. \n\nOverall, it was a very good meal. I probably won't go back for dinner due to \"price to fullness\" ratio, but I would go for a splurge on drinks with appetizers. I would highly recommend the Sangria, and I marked the dishes with a * that I would definitely order again.\n\nMany reviews have compared this to Firefly, and I would absolutely rate Julian's higher on quality and class, but maybe not quite worth the price jump for smaller portions.

The quality of food in comparison to the price, combined with atmosphere, make this a great Strip restaurant. \n\nWhile Julian Serrrano lacks the great location (not a high floor, no views or windows) of other highly-touted celebrity chef restaurants in the Strip, it certainly does not suffer from subpar decor or ambience. Tables are spaced nicely apart, chairs are large and comfy, and the tables are big enough to promote tapas-style dining of multiple small plates shared amongst a group of people. \n\nHaving had the real deal in Spain, I found that Julian Serrano stayed close enough to the real deal to pay proper homage to the tapas' heritage while still playing up to the level and diversity of palates you'll find on the strip. \n\nThe pan tomate didn't shy away from liberal use of garlic, as most Americanized Spanish restaurants would. And the mixed olive plate was done in a decidedly citrusy brine with young, powerful green olives that offered great character and in-your-face brightness. \n\nThe mushroom risotto was spot on, the arborio rice cooked to leave the perfect amount of tooth still on the grains (the pasta equivalent of al dente). We also very much enjoyed the truffled salmon, cheese plate and Spanish 'pizetttas'. \n\nService throughout the evening was pretty impeccable: well-spaced, attentive, but not intrusive.

Our reservation got us the worst table in an otherwise beautiful restaurant: right next to the service station, where servers zipped behind each of our chairs, even kicking the chairs a few times, with no apologies. Rather than attempt to guide us toward a complementary tapas offering, the servers (we had a couple) were more intent on getting the order and getting out. I really would have appreciated them noting, for instance, that the peppers were a pretty big order for two, or that there were three tuna cones for the two of us. There's nothing wrong with being efficient, and I can't knock them for being inattentive, but I felt set aside enough between the poor seating and curt service to pull the four-star meal into a three-star rating for the experience.

For $40, I expected it to be fantastic, and it didn't let me down. Hubby and I shared it and we polished it off. It came in a large pan with some spoons to serve ourselves onto our plates. It made for a lovely presentation, i have to say, and it was plenty of food for the two of us. We also had just one tapas to start our meal, the spinach with apple, pine nuts and garlic? It was tasty. I would have liked to try some of the other tapas too, but with the paella coming, we wanted to not stuff ourselves till we burst. \n\n       The decor is contemporary, the black trees in front were interesting, and I had a view of the back where they have lots of crystal vases and such on shelves. I don't know why they chose to go with that theme of glass decor, but it was classy. Our waiter was a nice guy who answered my questions patiently. The paella didn't take more than maybe 20 - 25 minutes to come out of the kitchen, which he told us would be less time than the other types, which the menu says take 45 minutes, I think. \nWe didn't have sangria or any other liquor, since i can not currently. \n\n       I hesitate to say.that we did have an issue with a hostess whom greeted us. \nShe came off as rude when she couldn't find out reservation, and asked if we booked for that night, and then said to me rather snobbily, \"this is SPANISH TAPAS\". \nI wish I had replied with \"Yes, and I was aware of that when I booked dinner here\". \nInstead, she then seemed to find it and nodded to the other hostess, without any apology for her attitude. The second hostess then walked us to a table, and cheerfully chatted me up about our vacation so far. She was very sweet but was clearly also overcompensating for #1's rudeness. Sigh. After we finished with the paella, my hubby decided to tell the waiter about her, and asked to speak with the manager. He came over and listened then said he will take some things off the bill...so he came back and hubby tells me that he took the PAELLA off, as well as my ice tea. I was shocked, that was pretty cool of him to give us our $40 entree. \n So then hubby was very happy, and I won't comment on my emotional state at the time. Maybe we will go  back in the future for lunch, not sure right now.\n\n\n    After thought:  I was going to order the spanish donuts for dessert, but there was a long pause after I was given the menu for that, so I decided to forget it.

We shared the tortilla, crab cakes, cheese platter, and something else.  I would have liked for the tortilla to be less runny.  The ingredients were fresh and higher quality.

My favorite was the spicy tuna cone. It had great texture and the flavors worked really well. The serrano ham plate was simple and everyone gobbled it up. The risotto wasn't the best i've ever had but the truffle flavor was intense and I'm a sucker for truffle anything. \n\nDessert: Churros with chocolate dipping sauce & Almond cake. The churros were hot but plain, no sugar or cinnimon sprinked on them. The chocolate sauce was thick and slightly spiced with chili, yum. I prefered the almond cake. It was simple and a nice finish to the meal but nothing I would specifically recommend to a visitor. \n\nDrinks- I have an obsession with Aviations and the one here was really good.

We started off the meal with the sliders, ceviche, and chicken croquetas. We might have ordered a dish too many as we were waiting for our paella, but oh well! I loved their croquetas. Crispy outer layer with a creamy, juicy chicken filling. It's like a bite sized pot pie! Although the dish is quite petite, it can be quite heavy. The ceviche I ordered contained white fish, octopus, scallops served with these chips reminded me of some root (I'm guessing its a lotus chip. ) it's a good light and appetizing small dish. The chips balances out the not too overwhelming lime juice.

Some of the other paella sounded tastier but I couldn't decide between chorizo and lobster so why not both?

It has been way too long since I've had paella like this.\n\nI couldn't finish half my paella since I do want to make some room for desserts. We split the molten chocolate cake with blood orange sorbet. After tasting some crappy fake blood orange flavored sugary ice with food coloring, I'm glad to have some real blood orange sorbet that is on point! It's a must for me to have some tarty flavors in case the chocolate gets too sweet and overwhelming. The chocolate cake itself is actually semisweet. Good on its own, great with the sorbet.

He said he would check and then disappeared for 10 minutes. People that just walked in were sat down before us as we just waited for him. He eventually came back and looked at us then walked away. Ok. After another while and more walk ins being sat in front of us a waitress finally said to follow her and sat us at our table. It was already past 9 at that point.

We told her to brig the Sangria ( which tasted like pure sugar water this time) and a calamari for and app. She brought the items and we told her we would be ordering the Paella because it takes 40 minutes to cook. She said fine and walked away. \n\nAfter about 25 minutes I called her over and asked if we could order. I also just wanted to double check with her that she put the paella in for 4 people . She looked at me like I was crazy. She said no, she put it in for 2 people. WHAT??? We have a table of 4. She said we should just order an extra item off of the menu if we were still hungry. I asked for the manager right away.\n\nThe manager came over and I explained the situation. He said he would try and get a 4 person paella expedited for us. He came out 5 minutes later and said we were so lucky because someone else had ordered a 4 person and he would just give us theirs. After we had all of our small plates, which were good they brought out the paella. OMG was this a joke? You could see right away that the rice was not cooked. We asked them to serve it up and they just glared at us and left a spoon. We tried eating it and the rice was so raw it was literally sticking to our teeth. We were picking it out. I called the manager back over. We asked him to taste it, he did and said that is how they serve it. What a liar. I have had the paella here so many times and never tasted this kind of crap. \n\nHe took it away and we just ordered the donuts for dessert. We ordered 2 orders so we could all have some. They brought out 3 and also a flan that tasted horrible and no one ate. The manager came back over and said he had removed several things off of our check. When we got the check, they charged us for half of a paella and 3 orders of donuts. WHAT??? GET THE MANAGER!! He came over again about 10 minutes later with a new check and said \"oh here is your real check\". Are you serious Mr. Manager? Nice try ripping me off. \n\nThis was a disaster and I will never return to this restaurant. What a joke! This place is not cheap and they should have it together by now.

Everything I had was really tasty! Tapas are usually expensive, so I didn't see this place being that much more expensive than others, but for a few extra dollars you get a lot of flavor. They have a lot of \"new\" kinds of tapas that are a fusion of other ethnic foods but you also have the traditional spanish tapas such as mussels, gazpacho, and the like. \n\nWhat did we get?\nAsparagus\nSpinach\nChicken croquetas (Don't get this. not worth the money) \nSpanish tortilla\nMussels\nWhite ceviche\nYellow tail dish (it was 3 raw slices of yellow tail that was wrapped around this sauce filled with what they said was \"sweet potato haystack\"...JUST GET IT.) \nGazpacho w/ lobster (MY absolute favorite, had this ball that broke open in your mouth that had this super savory broth in it) \nPaella valenciana (for 2)\n\nOh, and a glass or red wine sangria and a pitcher of sparkling white sangria\n\nMan oh man. Bill turned out to be 212 dollars or so. Not too terrible for a tapas place.\n\nWhat dishes were the stars in my opinion? \n\n1. Gazpacho- it was one of the BEST i've ever had. Lobster pieces were BIG too, and that weird sphere thing was tasty! Hard to share, since it's soup, though. BTW it's kinda cute that the waiter warns you that it's a cold soup. I guess people have made that mistake before, but don't get put off by it- it's SUPER refreshing! \n\n2. White ceviche- ohh...so orgasmically delicious. I wish they would put more taro chips on there with the ceviche...and I wish they would have a separate plating of the chips and ceviche so the chips won't get soggy. \n\n3. YELLOWTAIL ...it's pricy.. 3 pieces for 16 bucks so it was basically almost a 6 dollar bite you're paying for (plus tax and tip)  ...but it was so worth it. We didn't know it was only 3 pieces or else we wouldn't have gotten it, but if you're a baller...get this dish. it's extravagant, delicious and PERFECT. The best 6 dollars you'll put in yo mouth. \n\n4. I personally loved the spinach. It might not be worth it to some, but it was cooked great with pine nuts, raisins and apple pieces all lightly sauteed. it was perfect. \n\nThings that weren't so great: \n\n1. Mussels: I've had better mussels at other places. These mussels were small, and kind of sad. They all came out luke warm, too. Not that much broth in there either. My favorite mussels are from Cha Cha Cha's in San Francisco. These...just didn't keep up.\n\n2. Croquetas. bleh. I was expecting something else. some other girls in my table liked it but I wasn't impressed especially with the price.\n\n3. Worst was the tortilla. I really, REALLY wanted to like this. They gave you one small slice of an already made portion- I get that part. But I've had and had made spanish tortilla before and I get why it wasn't made to order.  The reason why I didn't say it was that good was because it was way too salty. Across the table, every single person in our party said it was salty...and it was. The texture, the flavor was all really, really nice... it was just the excess salt in the dish that made it not quite as tasty.\n\nOverall, a really nice experience. The paella was good and the portion for 2 people is enough for tapas for 4 or 5 or even more. For 4 girls, we got 2 tapas each and a paella to share and I think that's more than enough. We were stuffed beyond belief. (The waiter said 2-3 tapas per person..but i think you can get away with 1-2..and share a paella) \n\nThe sparkling sangria and the red sangria were both excellent.

We had made a reservation prior to sitting down and only had to wait a few minutes before being seated. We were a large group, so we ordered a lot. I'll go dish-by-dish and tell you what we thought of every item we ordered.\n\nHeirloom Tomato Salad: This was excellent, albeit expensive. It's essentially four tomatoes with a mozzarella ice cream on top (really more like a very creamy mozzarella). It's two bites per piece, but those two bites are absolutely incredible. 9/10.\n\nSteak Tartare: Delicious. The strip of steak tartare is very flavorful, as are the chips on top. The crunch is very nice and really counters the softer texture of the steak well. 9/10.\n\nYellowtail \"Tiradito\": Three pieces of yellowtail with sweet potato crisps in the middle. I don't even like sweet potato. But this was the best dish of the night. The fish is magnificently flavorful, and it literally melts in your mouth. If you're going to Julian Serrano, you NEED to get one of these. 10/10.\n\nWhite Ceviche: There is a but of a spice to this, and the fish is certainly flavorful. It's very good, though not extraordinary. There really isn't anything wrong with it; it just doesn't have the wow factor of the other dishes that we ordered. 7.5/10.\n\nTuna Carpaccio: The worst of the dishes we ordered. The tuna has a great texture but lacked flavor. It could have used some more seasoning, and the pine nuts and capers don't add much to it. 6/10.\n\nSalmon with Truffle: The salmon is lightly cooked and the truffle sauce is delicious. The proportions of the different components are perfect and the truffle b\u00e9chamel adds great flavor to the fish. 9/10.\n\nTraditional Spanish Chicken Croquetas: These were delicious, but I'm not so sure they were worth the price. Still, they were so moist and delicious that I would highly recommend them. 8.5/10.\n\nSpanish Iberico Sliders: Not your everyday sliders. The beef, pork, and onions mix perfectly with the lettuce and tomato, and together they make up the best sliders I've ever eaten. 9.5/10.\n\nShort Ribs: Delicious, melt-in-your-mouth flavor. They are ridiculously flavorful and tender. We ate the short ribs at Aureole the night before, and these were even tastier than the ones at Aureole.

Our idea for coming to Julian Serrano was to eat a lot for a good price, be full, but not too full before our showing of LOVE at the Mirage. We love variety, and Spanish Tapas definitely fell into this category of food exploration.\n\nThe ambiance is very open and colorful matching Aria's theme. You aren't locked up in a restaurant, and you hear everything that is going on within Aria. While away from the casino floor itself, you feel like you are in a mild busy cityscape.\n\nWe had a early dinner reservation at 4:15PM on a Saturday and the place was not packed at all. We sat down, and pretty much knew what we wanted to order and how we wanted to order it since we did our research on Yelp before coming, so here's the breakdown of how everything was. The order going down is how we ordered with the category that it is in. We went in 3's as the tapas come out very quickly!\n\n1. Tuna Raspberry Skewers - Unique twist on sushi. Square in shape, and eaten like a lollipop, I never thought tuna and raspberries would work, but they do! The tuna was soft, the raspberries sweet, but still tart. The crazy thing is that the raspberry is on the side, and they are filled with wasabi. So you eat the tuna skewer + the raspberry with wasibi, and wala ~ tasty tuna sushi. Rating: 4/5\n\n2. Creamy Risotto - The risotto was cooked perfectly, and the wild mushrooms stood out. The manchego cheese was pungent, but tasty tasty because of it's different texture. Rating: 4/5\n\n3. Stuffed Dates - So good! SOOOOO SOOOOO GOOD! This one stood out for us. The date covered in crispy pancetta with the tomato marmalade stuffed with goat cheese. Melt in your mouth FOODGASM. Rating: 5/5\n\n4. White Ceviche - This was a really zesty and fresh ceviche. The white fish was soft, and the mixture of peppers, red onions, and cilantro gave a good bite. Served with crackers, I felt that there may have been too much lime juice. Rating: 3.5/5\n\n5. Spanish Tortilla - This I felt was a take on breakfast & hashbrowns. While many will say it is nothing special, I am a hashbrown feen, so I found it delicious lol. Rating: 3.5/5\n\n6. Octopus - I've NEVER -- EVER -- EVERRRRRRRRRRRRR had octopus this soft before. It was ridiculous how soft it was. I don't know how they got it like this, but some parts just tasted like bone marrow consistency. With potato & Spanish paprika, it was a simple delight. Rating: 4/5\n\n7. Yellowtail with Yam - The crispy yam made this tapa stand out. For if there was none, it would of just been sashimi, and I wouldn't have paid for it. Fresh fish, crispy sweet yam. A sweet and savory combo that worked. Rating: 3.5/5\n\n8. Lobster Saffron - Half lobster tail, saffron oil, iberian pork, creamy potatoes, asparagus. The lobster was wrapped with the iberian pork. The tail was juicy, the potatoes as well. This felt more like a little entree. While delicious, I'm not sure if it was worth getting. Rating: 3/5\n\n9. Albondigas - Oh fluffy fluffy meatballs. So simple, yet so good. Great light sweet tomato sauce. Succulent juicy meatballs that just melt in your mouth. Potatoes in squares lightly crispy. Can I get a side order of rice to fill my Asian needs, and pasta to fill my love for Italian please? Rating: 4/5\n\nSo that was the meal, and as you can see, we ordered a good amount for two people. It filled us, but it didn't overfill us, and that's what we enjoyed. There was nothing bad about the meal, and everything was prepared well. For the price, some may question it, but it's Vegas. I would complain if the food was horrible, but it simply wasn't. You can go ahead and spend $60-80 on a piece of steak medium rare, or come here and experience more for your money!

Julian Serrano's Picasso is one of our favorite Las Vegas dining treats, and we expected his signature tapas restaurant to live up to his reputation.  Unfortunately, we didn't have that same experience. First off, let me say that in a way comparing Julian Serrano to Picasso is like comparing apples and oranges . . . two totally different types of food, different dining styles, etc., but one would expect that the quality and service for each respective restaurant would be of the same caliber. This was certainly not the case.\n\nFortunately, we had a lovely couple seated at the table next to us who were very familiar with the tapas style. The own a Mexican restaurant in Texas. They were almost finished with their meal when we were seated, so we were able to ask them about their choices. According to them, they ordered half the menu just to taste everything!  We started with the Yellowtail \"Tiradito\" (sliced yellowtail with sweet potato haystacks, horseradish cream and ponzu sauce. It was a hit . . . We followed that with the Black Pig Pintxo (Iberian pork shoulder meat with caramelized onion). It was divine! As our main course we ordered the Mixed Paella which serves at least two -- mistake!  Our waiter had emphasized to \"order the paella with your appetizers because it takes 40 minutes to prepare\".  Imagine our surprise wWhen he brought it to the table BEFORE our appetizers; his excuse was that they had a large party and had already prepared enough in advance. I asked them to take it back so that we could eat our food in the order in which it was intended. When the paella did arrive, it must have been the same one he brought out 30 minutes prior. The rice was dry, the lobster chewy, the mussels over cooked . . . the only tasty thing among the ingredients was the Spanish pork chorizo that brought a little flavor to the dish. Seriously a miss!\n\nHubby ordered the pistachio dessert and said it was heavenly . . . so maybe consider coming her for dessert and coffee instead.  One five star element was the Drunken Cherry cocktail I ordered. It was one of the best cocktails I have ever had -- Effen Cherry vodka, acai, pomegranite and lime with a garnish of Spanish cherries soaked in brandy. Our waiter redeemed himself when he asked if he could bring me dessert, and I said, I'd love a few more of those cherries . . . and he brought a plateful! \n\nI wouldn't say we had a bad experience here, just not as good as we expected.

Who doesn't like the sound of that?\n\nI certainly don't, so that's why I made a beeline to Julian Serrano for my first night's dinner on the Strip.\n\nFirst of all, Chef Julian Serrano's eponymous restaurant is absolutely beautiful.  It overflows with bold, colorful tile that's a feast for the eyes.  It's also *very* loud in there, since it's directly adjacent to the Aria resort lobby, a mere feet from hordes of tired hotel guests checking in and out.  And, no, there are no walls to keep out the hubbub.\n\nAfter taking a seat at the long, comfortably, and classy bar, I was quickly helped by one of the friendly and efficiently bartenders.  After ordering a glass of Sauvignon blanc to whet the palate, I browsed the mouthwatering -- and **long** -- menu of tapas options.  The menu is nicely organized into fish/ceviche, veggie, and meat/poultry tapas, making it easy to navigate.  There's also a catch-all \"new style\" tapas category, as well as paellas and \"platos grandes\" for those of you with larger appetites.\n\nFour items were just enough to fill the belly without making me uncomfortably full.  Here's the rundown of what I tried:\n\n1.  White ceviche.  Everyone knows I love a good ceviche, and this one was a knockout.  The white fish was tender and flaky, with just the right amount of heat and tang from the lime and cilantro.\n\n2.  Brava potatoes.  This dish was a little less exciting than I thought it would be -- it's essentially just fries with aioli.  That said, the flavors were excellent.  There's a *lot* of aioli provided, so I ended up taking the excess off to prevent the potatoes from getting soft.  I did enjoy eating the potatoes with the little skewers provided.\n\n3.  Tuna cones.  This dish was the weirdest and also my least favorite.  It consisted of 3 wantons (rolled into ice cream cones), which were filled with avocado, and then ahi tartare and aioli on top.  Again, my issue was the overabundance of aioli, which overwhelmed everything else.  I couldn't taste the tuna at all.\n\n4.  Santiago's cake.  This was an almond cake dusted with powdered sugar, with a side of almond ice cream.  Simple but very well done.  My only gripe was that the cake was a little dry, but this was remedied by letting the ice cream melt all over it.  \n\nAll in all, Julian Serrano was a great dinner, although the little hiccups along the way make me hesitant about rushing back.  After all, you're paying Vegas Strip prices here (most tapas are in the $10-15 range, but some are more), so you tend to expect perfection for your buck.\n\nThat said, with all the amazing options on Julian Serrano's menu, it'd be hard to resist the temptation to try them all.  =)", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 4, "useful": 8, "cool": 6}}, {"text": "Awesome Tapas dinner last night!!

After all, for all food connoisseurs in Las Vegas, surely Julian Serrano must be somewhere on their list. Tucked away inside the alluring Aria by the front desk, yet ever so far away from parking garage is this spot of expensive tapas paradise. To be of note - it IS a tapas place, hence why I haven't been on pins and needles trying to come here. Always in the back of my mind was the voice saying, \"So expensive for just tapas! Just go to Firefly instead!\"\n\nLuckily LVRW2013 has rolled around and I enjoyed a meal here with friends on a Tuesday night at 6:30 PM. Before being seated my friend and I ordered cocktails at the bar (all $14). I tried a fruity type drink that provided a nice start to my meal. Not too sweet, not too alcoholy, but still pretty steep in price. After drinks we were seated in the dining area further back, which is nice since it is over carpet, which brings the sound of the clacking of feet down to a minimum and it also hides your table from the casino. Chairs are plush and comfortable, lighting is perfect, and the ambiance is classy. \n\nService was excellent. Our server was prompt, kept our drinks filled, and in general was a very courteous gentleman. I ordered a chardonnay from the Bordeaux region of France ($16). A lovely wine indeed and of the two options (another which was from California) I am glad I splurged. Worth every drop.  \n\nOn to the food...\n\nChicken Croquetas - Simple yet tasty is the best way to describe these. The dish is not the most pleasant to look at, but the taste was deliciously fried on the outside and creamy on the inside.\n\nSalmon (with mashed potatoes and baby carrots) - The main dish is what let me down and which brought down my rating. The salmon was cooked well enough, but the portion size was disappointing. My friend got the chicken and after seeing her dish I was wishing for chicken. Also, the horseradish cream served on the side of the salmon just did not go well with the fish, to me personally. I am wishing now someone else in my party had wanted to do the paella, but in order to have that option you must have more than one person ordering the dish. *womp womp*\n\nMolten Chocolate Cake and Blood Orange Ice Cream - I do love blood orange ice cream and sorbet and this one was refreshing to have with the very decadent and very good chocolate cake. If anything, this may have been my favorite part of the dining experience, coming in second to the glass of chardonnay.\n\nOverall - I realize I am reviewing the LVRW2013 menu, but even so, this food reflects the establishment. I think the big thing was how flat the salmon fell for me. After all, it was my main dish. While the other items were good I believe they should have been better considering the establishment. \n\nWould I be back? I would try happy hour. I would even go back for a birthday party I was invited to here... or some other special event.

So if you are really hungry I suggest you go somewhere else or be okay to spend a lot of money at this place. Desserts were amazing. Our waiter recommended 'Bunuelos'; 5 stars! We also treated ourselves to 'Santiago's cake'; divine!

When I asked the manager, he said that that was the saffron and that saffron just tastes meaty. I cook with saffron a lot, and that's just not true.

Straying away from burgers and buffets, I decided to try out Julian Serrano and if you're looking for some latin spice, this is definitely a place to check out.\n\nThe Place -\nJulian Serrano is located inside the Aria and very easy to find. Located on the first floor next to the check-in area of the Aria, Julian Serrano is known for it's latin inspired menu with an upscale twist. The place itself is very open and by, no means, in a separate building or room. The restaurant blends very seamlessly with the main lobby of the hotel and can attract many guests as this is something they see first upon entering the Aria. The place is bright and, obviously, has a lot of latin-inspired decor. The bar is a VERY good size as it seems to wrap around the entire entry way. In addition to that, the restaurant itself has a very decent sized real estate being able to accommodate parties of any sizes. As with a lot of restaurants in Vegas, depending on where you are seated, people have a good few of the back of the house as well, which is always comforting knowing you can see the people handling and cooking the food. Not to mention, it's just always bad a$$ to see the chefs conjuring up everyone's dishes. Very nice place to come and relax for a few drinks or casually dine before hitting up all the various night clubs Vegas has to offer.\n**** 4/5 Stars ****\n\nThe Service -\nIt was a Friday night and I was struggling to find a place to go eat at. I was in town for a conference and it was the night before I was scheduled to fly back so I knew I didn't wanna stay out late or walk any place farther than I needed to. After perusing through the many options on Yelp and the dining guide, I settled on Julian Serrano. It was fairly early in the evening, around 5:30pm-6:00pm, so I managed to beat the dinner crowd. They had also just opened for dinner service so I lucked out and was able to walk right on in and pick my place at the bar. I was greeted by multiple friendly faces at the hostess stand one of which was the hostess herself as well as, what seemed to be, upper management preparing for the evening. The hostess smiled and politely let me know that the bar was available for open seating. I gladly obliged, took my seat, and was promptly greeted by the bartenders tending bar that evening. They took my drink order, handed me a menu, and gave me a few minutes to browse. The bartenders were very friendly and made themselves available to answer any and all questions I may have had about the place and/or the menu. The great service continued throughout the evening making sure that I was well taken care of and I always had a full glass in front of me. Great job, guys and thanks!\n***** 5/5 Stars *****\n\nThe Food -\nPrior to arriving at Julian Serrano, I glanced at the menu, as I always do, trying to figure out what would be appetizing for me to order. I decided on the short ribs dish; however, when I got there and looked at the menu more, I switched my choice and, instead, got the Crispy Baked Chicken (See Picture) and I'm glad I did. First, the accoutrements...the chicken was served with sauteed potatoes, Spanish pork chorizo, red bell peppers, and onions. The chorizo gave an excellent salty contrast to the chicken and I couldn't get enough of it. I wish they would've put more of it on there cause it was just that good. The bell peppers and onions were cooked throughout and gave the dish the bitterness and spice that it needed to balance everything out. The potatoes, unfortunately, left something to be desired. I'm not sure if it just happened to be the potatoes I was served, but they tasted really bland and stale to me and got to the point where I just ended up pushing a majority of them to the side. If it weren't for the deliciousness of everything else and combining the flavors, more of those potatoes would not have been eaten. Now, on to the main star of the dish...the crispy baked chicken. This has got to be, by far, one of the best baked chicken dishes I've had ever! The chicken, which are two boneless breasts, was cooked perfectly and very moist.

The great reviews on Yelp along with recommendations from friends made us very excited to come here and boy were we shocked. Every item we ordered off the menu was poorly executed (read over/undercooked and a total lack of seasoning). This was only further exacerbated when I asked our server how an item on the menu was prepared to which he stated he wasn't sure but he would go ask the chef. We didn't hear anything from him for about 15 minutes so I finally flagged him down to follow up, only to have him state with a dumbfounded look that he did not have an answer because he \"could not find the chef.\" We ordered two more entrees after this, 1 fish (the one which I had the unanswered question about) and 1 chicken. Suffice it to say, the fish came out horribly overlooked and chicken undercooked (YIKES I KNOW), and again both were completely under seasoned.  To top it all off, for a $300 meal the service was completely piss poor, the waiter never came by to ask how things were nor did anyone ever follow up.\n\nSo in summary, considering the server could not find a chef in the entire restaurant, our experience is far from surprising albeit inexcusable.

When making reservations, I requested a table away from the entrance (it opens up to the hotel floor, and I wanted to have a little more privacy and intimacy). We were seated at the very back of the restaurant, and our waiter was very good. As soon as we were seated, I ordered two paella dishes (Mixed and Valenciana)--I am allergic to shrimp so we opted out of the Marinera), since they take 45 minutes or so from the time you place the order. I asked that as we ordered the tapas, they come out slowly. I did not want to feel rushed. There were nine of us, and I also asked that as we order dishes, they are set up so that enough of us could sample each dish (meaning that if I order sliders, perhaps bring out two or three of the dishes--not just one dish with two sliders). Looking back, I realize this wasn't communicated very well. We ordered twelve tapas (vegetarian, meats, seafood, new style), and everyone was pleased with all of them. My only wish was that they weren't coming out so fast and that there were more on the plate to try, but the red sangria was fabulous and that kept coming! The paella was served tableside to us since the dishes were so large for the table. The lobster and mussels were excellent, but again, not enough to go around or it was that half the table was served the lobster, and the other half had none. We ended up cutting things up and redistributing plates so all could try things, but again, I wish there had been more seafood in the dish. Also, the paella seemed very wet to me. It wasn't one of my favorite paellas that I have tried (others at the table raved about it though).\nThe cost of the tapas and paella along with the rush of serving them is what gives this restaurant a \"very good\" rating.

Our experience at Julian Serrano fell a bit short.\n\nWhen we arrived for a Saturday night for an 8 pm reservation for 2, we were promptly seated in the back among other 2-person tables.

I asked for the drink menu and was told it was coming (in a slightly rude manner). Luckily, we were able to order some delicious cocktails and they came quickly. Our waiter made an appearance and right away I was not impressed with the service...he barely even made it known that he was our server for the night and was bent down near my husband's ear trying to pick out some things that we should try on the menu. I felt an odd disconnect... My husband asked how ordering usually works (since it's a tapas place), and the waiter said that we could order everything at once, and he \"would take care of it.\" We ordered a few fish items, a cheese plate, the Spanish tortilla, chicken croquettes, the beef short rib plate, and a few veggies. \n\nHere's where things got annoying. The Spanish tortilla was brought out first. It was tasty but slightly cold (not sure if that's traditionally how it's served?). Before we could even dig into the tortilla dish the waiters brought out the beef short rib. That was a WTF moment to me. Within minutes of receiving the beef dish they brought us the warm monkfish dish and the cheese plate. Our tiny table was filled with foods all getting cold because we hadn't even made a dent in the tortilla. We weren't even half way through our cocktails and half of our meal was in front of us. We had to tell them to slow down (luckily they did). I felt like I was at an Applebees. \n \nIf I were in a hurry, this would be good. But at 8 pm on a Saturday night in Vegas, we were not in a hurry. We like to slow down and enjoy our meal. I was irritated by the order of the dishes that were brought out as well as with the pace. Who wants beef short ribs as the second dish?? Typically you would want salads, fish, vegetable dishes brought first. They didn't even see if we wanted a bottle of wine to pair with the bigger meat dishes. I found the order of everything all very strange and felt rushed. \n\nOn the plus side, the food was all very good. Everything was beautifully presented and cooked well. We LOVED the cheese plate. It ended up being glorious to eat cheeses between small plates (while our beef and fish dishes got cold, haha). I would go there again for the cheese alone! \n\nSo maybe it was just a bad night...I never thought I would complain about too fast of service, but I am. There are times where it's appropriate to rush through dinner (like before a show, etc), but there are other times where you want to relax and enjoy good food and conversation.

A very enjoyable dish\n- Sliders - don't get this - only came with two sliders and the bread was a bit dry and overall not very original or inspired\n- Black rice - this is an actual dish and I found very delectable.  The price soaked in squid ink (?) was well seasoned and the octopus and seafood added some interesting texture to the bite\n- Tuna sashimi on seaweed salad - I would not order this, just get it at an actual japanese restaurant and you'll be much happier\n- Paella - definitely order this when you sit down as it takes 40 mins to cook.  We ordered the mix paella and it was very enjoyable.  The mix of chicken and seafood was nice and it wasn't overly salty.\n- Garlic Chicken - this was a surprisingly tasty dish.  It was simple but the flavor was excellent and the texture of the chicken was moist and soft on the inside with a thin but noticeable flour based covering.\n\nThe cocktails were OK but nothing to write home about.  \n\nWhy did it only get three stars?  Well our waiter who was a nice chap throughout the meal offered us an appetizer, a feta cheese, tomato, and bread type of dish.  When he offered this to us, he said \"i'll bring you out this appetizer\".  At the end of the meal, when we ordered 4 espressos, he said \"i'm going to bring you out coffee with liquer\".  In both cases, his tone gestures insinuated that we would be comped these small \"extras\" but when we saw the final bill, he had charged us.  The coffee drinks alone were $14 each.

Three pieces of  thinly sliced crudo yellowtail topped with thinly crispy sweet potatoes horseradish cream and ponzu sauce.

Unfortunately it all went downhill from there.\nMy fiance and I were hungry and excited to eat some spanish food so we ordered a bunch of different things.\nWe started off with the Jamon Serrano and Spanish Charcuterie. The Jamon was on top of some tomato garlic sauce. It was about as bland as they come. And I mean bland. They served it on top of some garlic tomato sauce which to me, all it does is mask the flavor of the ham. I was really disappointed. \nThe Charcuterie was also as bland as the ham. The lomo in that plate had absolutely no flavor. Where are they getting their products from?\n\nThen we got the cheese platter! another key word, CABRALES! I am from Asturias, that is where Cabrales cheese comes from. And I can say this much. That was NOT it. It is a very stinky, spicy blue cheese and what they served us was a creamy bland mess they called cabrales. \n\nThe tortilla....... sucked. Sorry, it sucked. It was so dry..... I almost finished my whole glass of wine with it. That is NOT how tortilla is supposed to be! For one because it sucks with onions in it. It completely overpowers the flavor of the potatoes and egg. But it was so overcooked..... \nI come from a family that makes spanish tortilla on a daily basis. I make it, my mom makes it, my grandma makes it.... and they all turn out glorious. Why is this one so..... meh?\n\nOnto the next...... the Octopus. It was surprisingly good! Nothing bad to say on this one.\n\nThe Stuffed Piquillo Peppers were delicious. It gave me a few good ideas to make at home since I have them in my fridge. \n\nand lastly\n\nThe Stuffed Dates. They were very delicious.

They said that they had this special menu from Sunday-Thursday at 11:30am-4pm so I had to get there on Sunday. It was weird because I checked the menu and it didnt mention the $19 so I thought it was a secret menu. When we got there, they gave us a regular lunch menu and I asked for the prix fixe but it was for $49 so I asked about the $19 one. He said it was only for Monday- Thursday but I told him that the person on the phone yesterday said it was for Sunday. He spoke with the manager and checked if they had the ingredients and they were able to provide this menu. I thought it was very nice of them to keep their word. So extra plus for them.

They have a bar and the game was playing so that was cool. \n\nFirst\n1) Lobster Gazpacho- chilled spinach tomato soup with lobster meat- I didnt see the chilled part so I was quite shocked by the taste of it. I never had purposeful cold soup so it took some getting used to. Not my cup of tea but I am glad I tasted a legit spanish appetizer. \n2) Wild mushroom soup- I preferred this one since it was salty.

I dont know how salmon is a spanish dish so it wasnt anything crazy special but it was good nonetheless.\n2) Rib eye steak- It came with eggplant and french fries and again I dont know how this is spanish but it was good. \n\nThird\n1) Santiago's cake- LOVEEE this!!! it is a traditional spanish almond cake with turron ice cream and candied almonds. It comes in a nice display and was deliciosss. The cake was tender and the ice cream went perfectly with it. I gobbled that thing right up.

And I have to tell everyone who have only been to those places to branch out and try some of the fine dining vegas has to offer.\n\nI was staying in Aria and it was my friend's birthday so we decided to splurge a little bit on a celebration dinner. We had 8 people with us and we were able to get seated right away with our reservation. The first thing our waiter recommended to us was the sangria. That definitely did not disappoint - it was strong enough to get me buzzed with just two glasses.\n\nWe got a variety of dishes:\n\n1. Raspberry Tuna - SO GOOD. it wasn't overwhelmingly fishy and the raspberry added a nice texture. The presentation was nice too. (comes in 4)\n\n2. Creamy Risotto - this was probably the best dish of the night. Everyone on yelp raves about this dish, and it was my favorite. Super filling and enough for 4 people to share (unless you're a manly man that eats whole cows for dinner, then you may need 4 plates).\n\n3. Lobster noodle dish - not sure what it was called, but I didn't particularly like this one. Reminds me of chow mein done wrong.\n\n4. Seafood ceviche - Delicious! recommended for anyone who likes ceviche, can't really say too much about it other than it was good.\n\n5. Ox Tail - i was pleasantly surprised about this one! so good and rich, a good meat dish since we ordered mostly seafood.\n\nA thing to note is that these are tapas and the portions are small. We paid about 40 dollars a person which I felt was really affordable with the quality of food and presentation.

Located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo is a mix of amazing places to eat with Jaleo holding up the growing Tapas category. The entrance to Jaleo is inviting and enticing and holds a level of energy not seen by most eateries on a Tuesday evening. Just walking in and sitting at the bar, I knew we were in for a treat.\nJust as the rest of the Cosmo, no level of detail went underlooked inside this Spanish Tapas endevor. From the Tapas Kitchen mid dining room, to the wood burning circle kitchen right next to the bar, Jaleo's let's you marvel in the mastery of culinary design by seeing how it's made right before your eyes. \nAt the bar, we ordered two drinks, I had a Tomato infused something or other that was out of this world, very pricey for the serving size, but worth having at least once. My friend ordered a glass of champagne which was also good I was told, but also on they high side for price vs. Volume. That aside, it was time to order. We got the Bacon Wrapped Dates, the Potato Chips with white and red sauce, Chirizo Wrapped with Potato chips, White Asparagus, and the Conejo (Rabbit). \nTo make this easy, I'll simply break it down:\nBacon Wrapped Dates: A typical order for us from Firefly, so we wanted to compare. The presentation was definitely not what we were expecting, but very fun to experience. They come served in a tennis shoe from a brand that we were told is the \"Adidas of Spain\". Aside from the off the wall plating, the Dates were amazing. The difference is, they deep fry the bacon wrapped dates so the whole bite is moist and flavorful with more of a hint of bacon and the richness of the date compared to most places where the bacon wins the flavor battle. A+\nPotato Chips with Red and White sauce: A simple dish with lots to love. The chips seemed freshly made and the sauces had a good contrast to each other. Being so fresh, the chips had less crunch than you'd normally expect, but I saw it as a good thing. Not mushy, just less crunch and more smooth textures. B+\nChoirzo Wrapped in Potato Chips: Simple, yet delightful. It is what it is, delicious Spanish chorizo, fresh potato chip, and a toothpick. Pick it up, bite, and enjoy. Simplicity at it's best, and tastiest. A\nWhite Asparagus: This was served inside a sardine-can-like tin sprinkled with a bit of cheese. The fresh crunch of each bite, cut by the slight bitterness of the cheese made each tiny serving seem like so much more. A\nConejo (Rabbit): Something that's definitely not on everyone's top choices to try, but should. This was a leg and ribs serving with an apricot compote that was light and rich with enough sweetness to nicely balance the supreme flavors of the juicy Rabbit. If you've never tried Rabbit before, this is the one to try. It is not off putting at all, and will make you wish you could have it every day if you could! A+\nTo finish us off, we figured we'd indulge and have the Chocolate Hazelnut Cake. What a work of art this dessert was. I would've paid for just one bite of it. The chocolate and hazelnut combination they use is an absolute marrige commencing on your pallet. It was so good, I'd go there to just order that! A+\nI thank the Cosmopolitan for choosing such an outstanding Tapas joint. I can't wait to try more of the menu.

This is off to a good start!\n\nWe started with the Aceitunas ($12 for 4 anchovy stuffed green olives and 4 kalamata olive spheres made from sodium alginate).  I've had Jose's black olive spheres at the Bazaar and actually thought the kalamatas work much better.\n\nNext, we had the Chistorra Envuelta ($8 for 6 skewers).  The spicy chorizo  was quite tasty and contrasted perfectly with the crunchiness of the potato chip wrapped around the  skewer.\n\nThe waitress highly recommended the Gambas al Ajillo ($10 for 6 shrimps) which the menu features as one of their most popular dishes.  Maybe it was high expectation from the waitress and the menu, but I thought the shrimp wasn't really anything special.  Sure it was perfectly cooked, but it just tasted like nicely cooked shrimp with garlic oil.\n\nMy favorite dish of the night was easily the Pinchon Estilo Alcantara which was squab topped with foie gras and shaved black truffle ($22).  All the flavors came together so well.. I would have ordered this plate just for myself.. who says sharing is caring?\n\nThe Rape a la Donostiarra ($10 for a large platter of thinly sliced monkfish) was pretty solid.  The waitress said it was a brave dish.. I've never had monkfish prepared this way before, but didn't think it was anything overly eccentric.\n\nFinally, we had the Arroz a Banda con Bogavante ($28) which is their lobster paella.  I was really looking forward to this, since we were sitting right next to the paella station.  As a quick note, they only serve 2 paellas at any given night, and could take up to 30 minutes to prepare, so be aware that not all options are going to be available.  The paella was quite rich and tasty.. a tad over-seasoned, but that's ok.  Each dish is served with half a lobster tail and a claw, which was a nice touch.\n\nWe had our meal with a pitcher of red sangria, which I highly recommend.  You can never really go wrong with wine mixed with fruit.\n\nOverall, Jaleo was pretty much what I expected from Jose Andres - tasty, modern Spanish cuisine.  I can't wait to come back to try everything else on the menu.  Definitely come in a group to maximize the selection.

The slick idiosyncrasy of The Cosmopolitan continues through Jaleo. I loved all the design details from the typographic front gates to the piecework bull mounted on the wall and chicken tots served in a shoe (surprisingly cute and not gross idea). If you're lucky enough to have arrived with good company as I did, the restaurant's open layout and interesting tidbits allows for a good night of rousing conversation. My own party aside, I found the dining staff to be quite full of themselves, or rather, brainwashed by the supposed amazingness and sadly mislead by what a standard portion size is. I give them part of the blame for setting false customer expectations.\n\nFOOD // The food really fell short of 3-stars. I've been to different small-plate kind of eateries before and Jaleo neither measured up for it's priciness in ingenuity nor taste. We took a while to figure out what to order because we were informed by our group of comrades who had a reservation before we did that the portions were fantastically small and the food not all that great. One friend honestly, and repeatedly, told us to get up and flee the place before it was too late. Could it really be that bad?\nsangria :: This was a good choice. Served with fresh slice of citrus, chunk o' watermelon, and some mint. And one will need some amount of vino to make up for everything else. \nlobster paella :: We expressed concerns about hunger satisfaction so the waiter suggested the paella as a good way to fill up. The lobster paella had good flavors, but was rather salty (like most of the food). \nfried bacon wrapped dates :: Bacon wrapped anything is always good and ever better when it's deep fried. \nchicken fritters :: They're like tater-tot sized pot pies. \ngarlic soup :: This was the worst. It tasted like you took the packet of Chicken Top Ramen seasoning and poured it into a cup of lukewarm water and then dropped an egg in there. The waitress gushed about how the egg is cooked at exactly 63 degrees and gave me a stony stare when she caught me rolling my eyes. I apologize that your soup sucked. \nchilled almond & garlic soup :: Interesting combination of flavors. Much better than the other soup, but that isn't saying much. \nkurobuta pork jowls & scallops :: I ordered this and it was microscopic for $14. A few slivers of unmemorable pork and maybe half a scallop total. I can get this for $6 at a Japanese izakaya. \ndesserts :: We ordered 3 with components like olive oil ice cream, flan, and chocolate mousse. Again, nothing I think is worth mentioning. Do we sense a pattern?\n\nAll in all, the food didn't impress me in any way, especially factoring in the price and portion size. We had a party of 7 and with 2 carafes of sangria, 3 paellas, plus about 10 small plates, it ended up being $51/person. Jaleo is like dating a rich bitch: she may look nice and spout esteem, but it's all shallow and will set you back more money than it's worth.

I have been to Bazaar (Jose Andres' restaurant in Beverly Hills) a few times so I kind of new what to expect. I would say I got pretty much what I expected.\n\nThe atmosphere is really nice. The Cosmo Hotel is very new and contemporary and Jaleo continues that feel. The restaurant is live and has a very fun, energetic atmosphere. There is an open-ness to the restaurant and it blends in with the rest of the hotel (so that you don't feel closed off).\n\nThe food (as with other Jose Andres restaurants) does not live up to the hype. The food is definitely not bad, but it is basically slightly above average. I love the tapas (small plates) style of eating, because you can try many dishes. And when you look at the menu, there are sure to be several things that look extremely appetizing.\n\nThe two of us had about 6 or 7 dishes. The cones filled with salmon sashimi and topped with salmon roe were very salty. I was expecting those to be better, they were just okay.\n\nThe Brussels sprout salad was pretty solid. We had a monk fish dish which was pretty good, it had a cilantro oil on it.\n\nThe bacon wrapped dates were very tasty. I have had bacon wrapped dates at many other restaurants, the difference here is that they were lightly breaded and deep fried. I though that was a nice touch. However, at other places bacon wrapped dates are stuffed with cheese (either a hard cheese like a Parmesan or sometimes a blue cheese). Here no cheese, and adding a nice Parmesan would kick it up a notch.\n\nThe veal cheeks were very good in my opinion.\n\nWe had a couple other salads including the lobster salad. Probably too much lettuce compared to the other goodies.\n\nWe also had the vegetable paella (which was the special) and it was pretty much vegetable paella. It was on the more expensive side (around $18) of the dishes and was not worth it. I would rather have had 2 more interesting dishes.\n\nIn the end, I would recommend this restaurant to others because the experience is worth it. The atmosphere and the unique dishes make for a fun time. Keep in mind, the dishes at this restaurant are not as \"wild\" as Bazaar where he uses several techniques some refer to as molecular gastronomy. But, the dishes are interesting and very palatable. Just don't go in expecting Michelin star quality food and you won't be disappointed.\n\nPrice is fairly reasonable for this type of setting. The dishes ranged from about $8 - $20 per dish.

I had been wanting to try it from the day it opened; the Iberico ham was calling my name!\n\nMy wife and I made our reservation through Opentable for Android and got right in at 630pm the day before Valentines. I immediately noticed that this was a \"hipster\" type of place with a modern feel; Wood floors and white tables without table clothes. The feeling was comfortable while retaining its coolness. If you are expecting a romantic, quiet, and private atmosphere this is not the spot for you.\n\nThe Menu is expansive and playful. Chef Andres' uses a nice sense of humor on his menu to get you to eat and drink! Most of the dishes are tapas style and this encourages sharing of course! We started with the Iberico Jamon bellota from the famous black footed pig! it's a little pricey at 22$ for five shaved slices, but go for it; you can't get this stuff in a supermarket.\n\nNext, we ordered the Soupa De Ajo which is garlic soup with a 63degree Egg. They served it tableside and it was Soo garlicky and delicious! The croutons melted right in front of you as the hot soup hit them. The soup was soul satisfying!\n\nFollowing the soup we had Dungeoness crab stuffed peppers. Tasty but not monumental. Then we got the foie gras and pork cannoli's in bechamel! Wow! Yummy! Topped with shaved black truffles this dish satisfies the biggest foodie! Rich and creamy and savory; everything you could want in a dish. We didn't think that our next dish of Veal cheeks could stand up, but the cheeks were out of this world! Luscious and tender you could eat them with your fork and served on the most wonderful olive oil potatoes you could ever want. The pork and the potatoes together were heavenly. This was our absolute favorite dish!\n\nThe night we were there the paella was made with Lobster. We went for it! As I said before, the chef is cute with his menu. So to me this seemed to be his signature dish. When you walk in to the restaurant you see a huge grill surrounded by UFO sized Paella pans.  I figured if you go to Jaleo then you have to try this dish. They tell you the paella takes about 45 minutes so it actually came out after our veal cheeks. Perfectly cooked lobster rested on top of the rice. This dish was all about the rice and the seafood with a yummy garlic aioli on the side. My only problem with the dish was that the Lobster was still in the shell. I have a problem with a place that serves lobster in the shell. I don't want to wrestle the damn thing to eat it. but it was a lovely dish and very good.\n\nOur two desserts were well done and tasty but the dessert menu is short; only about 8 choices. Save some room and share like the rest of menu!\n\nThe service was very attentive! Our water glasses were never empty and there was never a pile up of empty plates. The table remained clean and cleared throughout the dinner. Our waitress, Michelle, was helpful in selecting a nice Rose Cava that went very well with all the food. Even on a busy night they were really on top of the service.\n\nOverall I would recommend Jaleo to anyone who is into good food.

It rests on top of a bed of crispy noodles (with bits of cuttlefish mixed in).  Served with a garlic aioli sauce, which goes really well with the noodles.  This is a must-order dish.  It is a bit on the salty side though, so minus 1/2 star. Otherwise, this dish is perfect!\n \nSauteed shrimp (4 stars): Simple, yet good.  Served in a lemon-garlic sauce that goes really well with the juicy shrimp.\n\nChicken tenders/Croquettas (3 stars): A bit on the salty side.  The waiter recommended this dish as a house favorite, but it was only ok.  The filling in the fried dough was a bit too creamy for my liking.  I also didn't like the idea of it being served in a shoe.\n\nUni w/ pomegranate foam (1.5 stars): Very pretty dish, but taste-wise, not so great.  I love uni, but this dish ruined it.  Uni doesn't pair well with pomegranate.  Uni naturally has a slight sweet, creamy taste, but when soaked in pomegranate foam juice, it gives it a sour taste & sour uni is just not good.

We were in the mood for tapas anyway, so all it took was a quick visit to Open Table and we had a 9:30 reservation.\n\nThe place was bustling.  We showed up a few minutes late - you know how it is, walking the strip in heels - and still had to wait a few minutes for our table to be cleared and set, but we chatted amicably with the hostess (about the wonderfulness of the Mission in San Francisco, randomly) and were shortly led inside.\n\nThe decor was playful.  Our table was just beneath an enormous stuffed bull (I'm guessing it was not an actual, taxidermied one, but what do I know) wearing a silver lame wrestling mask, and I liked the  patchwork-style mixed prints on the extremely comfortable banquettes and the red pendant lamps that hung throughout the restaurant.  I especially adored the menus printed with various words relating to tapas - seriously, is \u00f1um \u00f1um the Spanish equivalent of nom nom?  Because that is way, way better.\n\nTo drink, we ordered a full carafe of sangria, which I found to be delicious in a spicy, more nuanced way than most sangrias (and which also seemed to be on the strong side - score).  To start with, we ordered the selection of five cheeses - Pasamontes Manchego, Murcia al Vino, Garrotxa, La Serena, and La Peral - and the Pan con Tomate with Jamon Serrano.    All the cheeses were delicious, although we counted the Garrotxa and La Peral as our absolute favorites, and although it did turn out that the cheese plate came with Pan con Tomate anyway (as well as dried apricots, raisins on the vine, and Marcona almonds), we were pleased to have the extra when the next round of food came.\n\nNext we had the warm Brussels sprouts salad, which was so amazing I considered demanding the recipe from the kitchen, with chunks of jamon Serrano, halved grapes, and dried apricots in a tangy dressing.  The gambas al ajillo were - I am so very sorry to say - not what I was expecting...I own Jose Andres' tapas cookbook and regularly make his gambas al ajillo from it to great fanfare, and these were not in the same style.  In fact you could barely tell that they had every been in the pan with that wonderful garlic and olive oil mixture, which we sopped up with the spare Pan con Tomate.  Finally, in an effort to order at least one thing that wasn't totally standard tapas fare, we had the Tortilla de Erizos, tortilla with sea urchin - the uni was creamy and provided a nice contrast with the tortilla, although, full disclosure, I wasn't totally won over and probably wouldn't order it again.\n\nFor dessert, we had the Pan con Chocolate, which was basically like, a quenelle of chocolate flan rolled in cookie crumbs and topped with ice cream, a superthin shard of caramelized bread, and a drizzle of olive oil.  It was AMAZING - sweet and salty and unctuous.  Seriously, I'm now contemplating putting olive oil on all my desserts.  Delicious and heart healthy!...or, you know, not.\n\nAfter a couple of cafe con leches we got the check and it was a very respectable $120 or so.

I originally had a res for a party of 6 people @ 6PM on Friday.  I called 3 days prior to change to 8 people @ 7 PM.  I didn't get a confirmation call the day-of which I thought was weird.  Sure enough, they never changed the original reservation and since we were \"an hour late\" when we arrived, they had already given up our table.  They did seat us immediately but had to squeeze us into a table meant for 6 right at the front of the restaurant by the bar and hotel escalators.  Yuck.  And, as noted by many here, the main dining room is certainly loud.\n\nI also think it's ridiculous that they don't answer their phones before dining service begins.  Having to wait til 8PM on the east coast to call and make (and then change) reservations was ludicrous.  This is probably also why they don't call you to confirm.\n\nSo, we were seated and the waitress came around to take drink orders and informed us that, in her exact words, \"the kitchen is broken\" and they were doing all the cooking on the grills in the middle of the restaurant, so there were a few dishes that weren't available.  She didn't specifically mention which, of course.\n\nWe got our drinks and they were all amazing.  The famous G&T, sangria, some gold sparkly drink, a drink with instructions on how to drink it (dip this into this, then put this in your mouth, then sip this, then do a dance...)\n\nNow, I'm a tapas whore, and the menu at Jaleo is very much standard classic tapas, nothing really out of the ordinary.  So I go to order 6 of the usual suspects for my wife and I.  They couldn't make a single one of them.  Well, what can you make then?  \"Well nothing from this side of the menu or that side of the menu.\"  So...let me try again...what CAN you make?\n\nWound up figuring things out and placing our order, and the tapas started arriving shortly thereafter.  Except the runners kept coming to my side of the long table, saying to me what the dish was, and then putting it down in front of me.  So I had to turn into the waiter, loudly screaming across the table to see who ordered each dish and then passing it down.  I finally got fed up around the 8th plate or so and started forcing the runners to do their job and figure out who ordered each dish so they could place it in front of the right person.  For.every.single.dish.  Ugh.\n\nAlso, there were a few dishes we had ordered doubles of that we never received.  \n\nThank god the food was good.  We probably ordered every dish that was available and none disappointed.  Winner of the night in my book was the lamb ribs.  Fall-off-the-bone delicious.

Plus being a Top Chef fan, I am always keen to try some of the guest judges cuisine.\n\nFirst of all, I want to preface this. I do not doubt that Mr. Andres has incredible skill. I think that some of the things we had took a lot of technique to perfect (ie, Iberico ham croquettes and Cod empanadas). But technical skill does not make a great meal because in the end (for me)...it is all about flavour.\n\nSo we started off with some roasted peppers, eggplant and sweet onion which was not what we were expecting. If you check out the pics - the eggplant looked like tapeworms swimming in olive oil. Visual appeal rates a zero. Luckily, it tasted okay albeit pedestrian given the caliber of this establishment.\n\nI think the thing that makes this place shine is their ability to take make fried food with a molten center. Both the Iberico ham croquettes and cod empanadas were surprisingly lovely and crisp on the outside without succuming to the liquid in the middle. There were problems with the these dishes though. The flavour of the Iberico ham was lost in the enveloping bechamel sauce. The cod empanadas were good but were overly fishy for my hubby's tastes (kind of like a strong mackeral - I'll admit, I did enjoy this but would likely not order this again).\n\nIberico ham (oh, that creamy nutty luscious goodness that literally melts in your mouth) was very small portion considering the cost. Doesn't come with bread either which made it difficult to truly enjoy due to the inherent salinity of the meat. It definitely needed something else to justify the cost of this dish.\n\nThe foie gras cannelloni was a huge disappointment mostly because of the preparation of the foie gras filling. The texture was grainy while the flavour of goose liver was completely absent from the dish. As a matter of fact, the filling had an unpleasant sourness to it that even overwhelmed the lovely unctiousness of the liberally combined shaved truffle and truffle oil. As they say, no bueno.\n\nBy far the best dish of the night - the veal cheek with morel mushrooms. Utterly delicious, the judicious scent of cinnamon gave a mild hint of spice in this earthy dish. The textures of the meat was marvelous - like the best succulent short rib you've ever had. \n\nHazelnut cake was surprising lacking in hazelnuts other than as a candied garnish. For a Nutella lover like me, it's like a bait and switch and I was oh-so-sad. A chocolate mousse over sponge was okay but nothing you couldn't get elsewhere for significantly less. Toying with my affections that way is a cruel joke, my friends. A cruel joke indeed.\n\nLike all tapas places, the portion sizes were small and definitely overpriced. I would probably go back again for the veal cheek alone (yes, it is that good and is also the sole reason this place rates a 3) but would likely order other things off the menu.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 2, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "I came here back in February.

Our friends who were treating opted instead to order a custom Paella (serves 6 and there were 5 of us) with lobster and calamari.  I think it cost $120.  It was outstanding.

This is Las Vegas, after all, and Jaleo has set itself up to be held to a high standard.  Summary of our experience last month to start for those who like to read the ending of a story first is this:   \n\nFood:  5 Stars. \nValue: 4 Stars.  \nAmbiance Main Dining room: 4 Stars.  \nAmbiance Secondary (The Bull) Dining Room:  2 stars. \nService: 2 Stars.   \n\nIt was AOK but not so \"Yay\" as a total package experience that we're eager to return.  Are we glad we went once?  Yes. \n\nFOOD & LIBATIONS:  These were the best part of our experience.  We're fans of tapas in general and chef Jose Andres' approach in particular.  We had high expectations for the food and we were not disappointed.  Creative menu, perfect execution by the kitchen with sophisticated and subtle flavors for each of our five (including dessert) choices.\n  \nThe savories we enjoyed were:  1) potato croquettes (not to be missed), 2) salad with cipollini onions - blue cheese - clementines (delicious), 3) monkfish in parsley oil (intriguingly good) and  4) saute of mixed wild mushrooms and Spanish sausage (heavy on the mushrooms so just right for us). \n\nWe chose a dessert special that was a wonderful combination of grapefruit sorbet and ice cream - top notch. \n\nOur beverage choice was house made Sangria. Don't scoff - we're normally not fans of Sangria either, but this was  good and a perfect complement to the food, not to mention most affordable. If don't try the Sangria we think you'll be missing out.\n\nPortions were perfect - we could not have eaten any more but we would not have wanted any less. \n\nVALUE: A nice surprise about Jaleo for us was how affordable it was, by Las Vegas standards at least.  Our total meal for two before tip was just under $80. \n\nSERVICE:  Here the disappointment sets in - big time.  When we finally (you see where this is headed) placed our order, and asked to have the dishes delivered in a specific order, which we were assured would be no problem, our server said something about like this.  \"You've ordered unusually well for first time guests at Jaleo.  That's probably because you needed to wait on us for such a long time to take your order that you were able to really study our menu.\"\n\nTA-DUM\n\nShe may have thought that was funny; we weren't so sure. Because it is true that after being seated and offered water by the server's assistant (more on that in a minute) we waited better than 15 minutes before we saw a server at our table, in spite of two walking by us several times.  We finally had to flag an assistant down to ask to have someone wait on us.  And it's not as if we were tucked in a corner...being seated on the banquette under The Bull and all.\n\nThen the food items were served out of order.  Which suggests inattention to coordination with the kitchen. Everyone can have a bad night.  Maybe the poor service quality here is not the norm, but it was particularly surprising given it was not quite 7p and the restaurant wasn't even half full.\n\nOne word of caution about an item that can run up your tab. When you're seated the server's assistant will ask if you would like water. Yes? Then you'll be asked if you'd prefer sparkling or flat. If you think flat means no charge, you'll be unpleasantly surprised when the bill arrives. If you want water without charge you'll need to specify, you will not be asked, \"tap\" water. We weren't the only table to feel \"had\" by that procedure. Fortunately we caught it in advance - the folks next to  us had the unhappy experience of learning the charge applied for water when they got their bill.  Were I making the management decisions here, for purposes of customer good will I'd make sure the fee for flat water was explained at the time the orders were taken.   It's a little thing - but it is a thing.\n\nAMBIANCE:  The main dining room is where the open kitchen and bar are, and where the action is.  Unfortunately, if you want to sit at a table in this section you'll need to navigate high bar height seating.  (Although if you want to sit AT the bar, they do provide a couple of spaces of standard height seating.)  If you want a table with standard dining height seating, the secondary dining room it is.  More sedate and actually sort of absent decor, we would have elected the main dining area but for the high seating at tables.  I'm not sure that it is with high stool dining tables - they don't work great for smaller children, shorter adults, some older adults and in general women in heels and skirts trying to maintain decorum for a business discussion.

Can't say that waiting for our table was awful. When you have good company and a cool place like the chandelier bar, time seems to go by pretty fast. We headed upstairs just in time to be seated. The restaurant was jam packed. It's to be expected, the Cosmopolitan hasn't even been open a year and everyone wants to know what it's all about....the stores, the bars and most certainly the restaurants! \n\nWe were seated \"outside\" the actual restaurant. We were seated at the very last table - which leads right to the elevators and hotel rooms. This ended up being the best table possible!

First, let me be up front with you...Mama's on a budget!! So I knew going in that I didn't want to spend a lot of money and that I would be ordering my own tapas for self consumption as opposed to the family-style sharing. I told the table that I was doing my own thing and everyone was fine with that. I can't remember what everyone else ordered, but it was quite a bit! I ordered two items off the menu. I started with Manzana con hinojo y queso Manchego (Sliced apple and fennel salad with Manchego cheese, walnuts and Sherry dressing) Only $9....budget friendly, gotta love it! The size was surprising - but then again, it was meant for sharing. It wasn't small and it wasn't even medium...but decently sized. As I waited for my second item, the rest of the table had dishes coming out. I wish I could recall what the heck they ordered that came in a sneaker. YES PEOPLE....A SNEAKER! What about a sneaker suggests a food item would be more appetizing while residing in an opening of foot apparel? Yes, it was clean. Yes, it was brand new (at least from the looks of it), but why, OH WHY, would you deliver a dish in a sneaker and then say \"I thought you'd enjoy it more in my gym shoe.\" I get that it was meant to be comical, but I just didn't get why it would be served in a sneaker in the first place. I was eagerly anticipating my Carne asada con piquillos Juli\u00e1n de Lodosa (Grilled hanger steak with piquillo pepper confit). I though for $14, it would be a decent size...especially for family-style sharing. This is where my hugest disappointment resides. The dish was horribly undersized. It was one small piece of hanger steak that was cut into fourths. The pepper was a least two times the size of the steak....would you like some steak with that pepper? I understand that the portion sizes are meant to be more of a tasting menu, but you would think that they would give you a little more, especially with a family-style setting. It was quite delicious and it left me wanting more....oh the inner workings of the restaurant business to get you to spend more of your hard earned dough! \n\nOverall, it was a decent experience.

To start off with the restaurant doesn't even have it's name on the outside, how is it people are suppose to find the place if it isn't label? Is it suppose to be a secret that only a certain group of people know about?

Once we got our seats, I might was well be eating with the other patrons surrounding me, that's how close, cramp and loud it is!\n\nOur waitress was very pleasant she took the time to explain the menu to us and handed us an iPad to order drinks. So what was the point of the iPad drink menu? Absolutely nothing! Basically it's a 300 dollar drink menu. You're suppose to scroll through the different cocktails, wines, beers...etc and you show your selections to your server which he/she writes down on a pad of paper. It's not like your sending your order electronically to the bar...because that would make too much sense. \n\nSo after you waste your time trying to rationalize the use of the iPad drink menu it's time to order the food. Ironically this doesn't involve another iPad. So we ordered six things off the menu, 3 for the each of us.  Now I've been to other tapas restaurants before and when you order a couple of things off a menu the server does their best to try to get as many plates to you as possible so they can get you in and out. Well apparently that's not part of Jaleo's business model. Their model seems to work as let's wait 15 to 20 minutes before each plate comes out. Keep in mind that we had a show to attend across the street at Planet Hollywood at 9pm and I was required to pick up the tickets by 8pm, our reservation was at 6pm. So an hour and half goes by and still we didn't get our 6th plate, apparently the waitress or the kitchen staff totally forgot, so the restaurant manager reassured us that the dish would be out in a few moments. 10 minutes went by and still nothing, keep in mind it was a pasta dish...nothing super complicated! Eventually we got frustrated with the wait time and demanded the check, they of course they didn't charge us for the dish they couldn't get to us in time.

He brought me another to try and when I told him I thought it was corked he said it just had \"barnyard\" notes to it. Who the heck wants to drink a wine that smells like a barn? We ordered a meat sampler plates, some olives, ham croquettes, shrimp with lemon aioli and oilive salt. Everything was good, not amazing and the portions were so small even for tapas that we either each got one bite or had to cut something in half. We didn't even feel like we'd eaten anything after the first seven plates that I proceeded to quickly order 7 more. The mussels stood out but the paella was so bland and crunchy (underdone) that we had to send it back. We decided to leave before dessert and headed next door to Blue RIbbon Sushi because we know they have the best ginger bread pudding in the world.

I wish I hadn't pushed for a third try, because this meal sucked.  I would've given it one star, but one thing we had was really good, so it gets an extra star.  \n\nMy favorite foodie friend and I were both in Vegas on a Friday night, so decided to go to Jaleo.  He has been to the one in DC before and liked it, and I like Jose Andres food, so we were both excited.  \n\nWe were sat promptly, and the waitress came over a few minutes later.  She gave a whole canned speech about the menu (which is something I hate)...and gave us the iPad wine list.  There are some relatively good priced wines and of course lots of spanish options, so it started out good.  \n\nShe finally came and took our order, and we got a few things from each part of the menu, including the Paella Valenciana.  She told us they would group our items from the kitchen light to heavy and stage them to come out 1-2 at a time.  Great.\n\nHowever, that wasn't the case.  We got three things within like 2 seconds of each other.  The first things were 1. Pan con tomate (Toasted slices of rustic bread brushed with fresh tomato). this was adequate.  not quite the traditional way, but tasty enough; 2. Some tiny green olives stuffed with anchovies and \"liquid black olives\". this dish was $14 for like 5 small green olives.  total rip off and i know anchovies are salty, as are olives, but this dish was too salty to eat...and yes, i've had them both together before and it doesn't need to be that overly salty; 3. tortilla de patata (Spanish omelet with potatoes and onions).  i'm about to get married, and this is one of the dishes on my menu, which means i've tried about 20 tortillas from caterers over the last few months, and this version was the worst i've ever had.  previously, i was shocked by how bad some of the caterers versions were of this dish, but this dish was twice as bad as the worst.  first of all, she asked us if we wanted it well done when we ordered it.  this is not a question that should be asked.  it's supposed to be a simple dish:  onions and potatoes sauteed til tender, add egg, let form til set completely.  that is it.  we got it and it was wet, and runny, so not even well done like she asked if we wanted it.  it was also super thin, with only like one layer of potato.  it was so gross we didn't finish it.  \n\nSo then we flagged her down and said we wanted to slow it down a bit, since everything so far had been rushed to our table. This was a mistake, because from then on it was supperr long wait for everything.  She told us then that our paella was ready, and we said oh no thanks - we want to wait until the end for that dish, since it's most like a \"main course\".  This is after she told us the kitchen would structure it light to heavy for us, so delivering paella with the first few things made no sense.\n\nThe next dish was Ensalada rusa (a salad of potatoes, imported conserved tuna and mayonnaise).  This was \"okay\", but not great.  It was much better than it looked - It was covered with foam.  It looked like my cat threw up on it.  I'm not a foam fan.  But the potatoes were cooked well, and the tuna was tasty.\n\nThe next dish was the Seared scallops with romesco sauce.  The dish arrived and was pretty enough to look at.. However,  both our scallops had grit.  This, is not good.  Neither of us finished our scallop (the dish had two) and we called the waitress over to tell her they were gritty.  She apologized, but didn't seem to really know what that meant. \n\nThen we got the last dish before our paella...the veal cheeks with whipped olive oil potatoes.  This is the only reason the restaurant got 2 stars.   This dish was really good.  Looked good.  Tasted great.  Very tender veal cheeks.  The potatoes were fluffy bites of heaven.  Very very good.  This is what I expected every dish to be like, but sadly, it was the only good dish.\n\nSo now we are excited to try the paella.  i guess i was still holding out hope it would save the meal?  but the waitress comes over and tells us that they're out of the paella.  What?  We ordered it an hour ago.  They had it.  You tried to serve it to us at the start of the meal, we said we'd wait...and now you're out of it??  She offered us a different paella, at double the cost of the one we ordered.  We said, no thanks.  And were super unhappy about it.  We were both still hungry, but didn't want to try anymore crappy food, so asked for the bill.\n\nWe got the bill, and the damn scallops were still on it.  We called the manager over to complain (we've both been in the biz for years, and if someone complains about a legitimate quality issue, that should NEVER be on the check).  So we explained that they were gritty and shouldn't be on the check.  He apologized and claimed it was an oversight and took it off the bill.  \n\nOverall, a disappointing meal and I'll never go back.  It was so overpriced and only one thing was good.

The restaurant has a great external appeal, with an open eating area, mostly white decor and big chunky tables for seating in the overflow area.\n\nThe wait staff seemed young and a little under experienced.  We got shifted wait staff within the first 10 minutes of being in the restaurant and the young lady we were left with was bubbly, yet didn't know quite what she was serving as in experience.  She also had a painfully short attention span and would walk from the table without warning.\n\nThe wine list was heavy on $100+ bottles with a scattering of under $100 bottles.  We opted for a $48 bottle since we didn't need anything expensive and the bottle was still excellent.  If you go, don't bother with the American wines, as those are priced way above the $100 mark per bottle and for a casual tapas meal, IMHO you don't need to spend the money when most of the wines on the list are probably good selections.\n\nWe started with a board of all the cured meats, which included both the iberrico hams, the chorizo, serrano and pork loan.  We paired that with some manchango cheese which all together was great with the bottle of wine we were enjoying. And the quality of meat was a good amount for two people to share.\n\nNext we had the salmon roe cones, which looked like a borrowed dish from Thomas Keller's French Laundry with a play on the ice cream cone.  The cones had salmon roe on top and filled with crab, which was tasty, but the roe didn't really stand out much.\n\nWe then had the egg topped with caviar, which was spectacular, but it wasn't the egg or the caviar which made it, but the caramelized onions under the egg made it a home run.  All together it rocked, but if it didn't have caviar on it, I don't think you'd notice a difference.\n\nThen came our seafood tapas, we had the shrimp and scallop dishes, which were both excellent and cooked perfectly.  Out of the two, the shrimp was the clear winner, and if I did it again, I'd get two of those rather than the scallops.  \n\nOur last tapas was the veal cheeks, which were served over mashed potatoes, which was like a braised short rib without the unnecessary fat.  Very tasty, but I'd like a little finishing salt on it to bring it home and cut the richness a bit.\n\nAfter it was all said and done with we signed the not so expensive bill with a couple expressos which was absolutely a great finish as the expresso was very smooth and went well with the whole meal.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Right off the escalator on the third floor of the flashy Cosmopolitan sits Jose Andre's Jaleo.

Nothing. \n\nAs a party of six, we headed the waiters advice and ordered 2-3 items per person - a few at a time, starting with the pan con tomate and progressing  from there to meats and cheeses, on to vegetables and seafood, and finally to some meat dishes. We ended up ordering additional orders of a few items , such as the gambas al aljilio and the brussel sprout salad. These are items not to miss.  Other standout items include the olives (including 'liquid' olives, a simple delight of molecular gastronomy) and the secreto Iberico, which we ordered at the very land, when we were still just a little hungry - and ended up devouring. All of this food went perfectly with a well-priced Rioja.\n\nDessert was a bit of a hit and a bit of a miss. The flan tradicional was one of the best specimens of that dish that I've ever had. In fact, self proclaimed haters of flan were devouring it along with the rest of us. The cafe solo (espresso) is the best I've had outside of Italy. The big down was the apple tart - which wasn't really very apple-y or tarty. We could have done with out this.\n\nThis was a slow, pleasant meal.

Jaleo is EXTREMELY accommodating for large groups. They let you fully customize the menu, and they even printed our event name at the top! We had a vegetarian in our group, and the day of the dinner, they really took care of her and gave her unique dishes to accommodate her diet. \n\nI really loved our experience at Jaleo. It was very well worth the money we spent. If we come again as a large party, I would definitely want to eat there again.\n\nBelow is our menu and my opinions on each dish. The full array of dishes cost us $$105pp, and that includes tax and tip.\n\n**Seleccion de jamones Fermin pro Jose -- the ham selection was very good! the fatty one they brought out was extremely buttery and tasty.  It came with a side of tomato bread (pan con tomate). \n\n**Aceitunas rellenas y acietunas 'Ferran Adria' - not my favorite dish.  the liquid olives were weird and CRAZY SALTY!\n\n**La Serena con membrillo - strong cheese in a little cone w/ quince paste.  if you are not a fan of blue cheese or goat cheese, you probably wouldn't like this one. The aroma of the cheese is very pungent, but I thought the quince paste balanced it out.\n\n_____________\n\n**Salmon crudo con vinagreta de anchoas - The salmon was very fresh, and the dish was served like a tartare.  The slices of salmon were very thin, with the lemon anchovy oil drizzled all around.  Kudos from all around the table for this dish.\n\n**Gambas al ajillo - There is a reason why this shrimp is 'VERY FAMOUS'.  The sauce is incredible, and the shrimp is perfectly cooked.  My friend wanted a straw to slurp up the leftover sauce haha\n\n**Huevo frito con caviar - egg with egg.  DELICIOUS! MY FAVORITE OF THE NIGHT.  It was so flavorful. The egg was poached perfectly with some runniness on the inside, and the caviar on top gave it just the right amount of saltiness.  yumm!!!!!\n\n**Escalivada catalana - roasted red peppers and eggplant.  good palate cleanser.  the smokiness of fire roasting the veggies was perfect.\n\n_____________\n\nManzana con hinojo y queso Manchego - LOVE Manchego cheese.  This salad was extremely refreshing, and the fennel bulb was not too licorice-y.  We ate this slowly so that we could pick at it the rest of the dinner.\n\nButifarra casera esparracada - pork sausage stew - it was good, but not very memorable.\n\nFricando de carilleras de ternera y pure de patatas al aceite de oliva - the veal cheeks were so tender. This dish would have been perfect, and I probably would rave about it more if it had come earlier in the meal.  We were getting full by this point!\n\n_____________\n\n**Setas al ajillo con la serena - sauteed wild mushrooms - had to get some more vegetables in there somehow :) not bad\n\n**Carne asada con piquillos 'Julian de Lodosa' - It is very easy to overcook this cut of steak,but our steak came out a perfect medium.  Tender, juicy, yummy :)\n\n**Arroz a banda con bogvante - lobster paella.  again, if this came out earlier I would be raving about it.  sooooo stuffed!\n\n___________\n\nDESSERT!\n**Flan - YUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMY -my favorite\n**Chocolate hazelnut mousse cake - very rich, and very good, but i could only have 1 bite.\n**Olive oil ice cream wtih grapefruit - surprisingly good!

If you want a quiet and subtle dinner, go sneak a sandwich into a library because this place ain't for you.\n\nThis restaurant is also my favorite restaurant in Vegas, taking over the esteemed spot that my beloved Rosemary's Restaurant held for a while (before closing).\n\nWhat is so great about this place? The food, drinks, service and decor. Did I miss anything? It was fun.\n\nJaleo is a Spanish Tapas restaurant, so you'll be ordering multiple, small dishes consisting of flavorful servings from the mind of Jose Andres. This wonderful guy might be Spain's greatest ambassador to the world since Fernando Alonso tossed his F1 career in the trash by going to Ferrari. But I digress...\n\nWe ordered a number of dishes (mostly the GF's favorites, because a happy GF is a happy GF), and enjoyed the offerings more than any restaurant in recent times. And by enjoyed, I mean \"got a kick out of what we had.\"\n\nDishes that we enjoyed:\n\n- Pan con tomate with Spanish anchovies: The GF loves anchovies and these white anchovies were a knockout. She wholeheartedly approved of this dish.\n\n- Spherical Olives: Molecular gastronomy right here. It looks like an olive, but it's not. Think of a thin membrane that contains the most intense olive juice you will ever experience. Explosion of Olives as soon as you pop one in your mouth.\n\n- Selecci\u00f3nes de embutidos: A selection of cured Spanish meats. Nice!\n\n- Canelones de cerdo y foie con bechamel: (From the menu) \"Pork and foie gras canelones with b\u00e9chamel sauce\" - lots of flavor but I wish it was larger so I could indulge myself more. I could've just ordered two dishes and been content, FWIW.\n\n- Croquetas de pollo: Chicken fritters that we demolished in no time.\n\n- And my favorite: Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s' Gin and Tonic. This is the Ultimate G&T I've ever had. The nice thing is that I'm \"almost\" able to duplicate it at home w/ the following:\n\nA shot or two of Hendrick's Gin (required - no other Gin will do)\nOne entire bottle of Fever Tree Tonic Water (you can find this in Honolulu at Tamura's)\nThree Juniper Berries (find them in your spice shops)\nA sliver of lemon skin with NO PITH. 1/2\" by 2\"\nA thin slice of Lime\nThere's one more leaf that I never got the name of. It wasn't Mint or Shiso but I don't use it at home (whatever it is)\n\n- There were a few more plates that were rather good, but I was pretty bulletproof by that time from the Gin and Tonics. So I can't remember what we finished off with exactly.\n\nTip: Ask for Donny as your server - extremely knowledgeble, funny and observant. The manager John was very excellent and attentive as well, along with our female server on visit #2 (sorry, I missed her name but tipped her well - she was great too!). They treated the GF and I wonderfully on our second visit a few nights later also.\n\nIf you haven't noticed, I really enjoy great food with the GF. And nothing makes me happier than knowing she's having a great time at a restaurant. Jaleo is the restaurant that made she and I the happiest, and we will always make it there when visiting Vegas.\n\nI hope you have as much fun as we did.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 4, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "Worst experience I could have imagined.

Just go try it if you visit Jaleo. You won't be disappointed. Next were the mussels marinated in Sherry vinegar. The leftover marinade was great for the break they brought out at the end. They talked me into ordering the toasted break with the tomato spread on it. Very Very tasty I must say.

When will you give us half stars???!!!\n\nI think 3.5 or 3.75 is more accurate for me.  I've been here three times now and have had vastly different experiences in terms of service and of food. I wouldn't go so far as to say the place is inconsistent (although that wouldn't be a surprise as it is in The Cosmopolitan-the Kings of Inconsistency), but the food flavors and preparation are vastly different from dish to dish. The price is sometimes off-putting for what you get; it is Vegas though...\n\nIf you go for dinner and want to order wine, the server will leave his ipad-wine list with you; it's cool. I still like someone who can discuss wines with me a bit more than our server could.\n\nTo keep it light and casual, Jim G. and I grabbed some snacks in the bar a couple times. That's how tapas is really done in Spain, anyway. Two different bartenders on the two nights we went. Both were cool, although one was slammed (and apparently short-staffed) so he was not the kindest; service was fine though. \n\nDuring our dinner visit we tried the Monkfish: I strongly suggest you stay away from this dish!!! One of the best dishes I've had ever was monkfish in Paris, so I figured I'd give this dish a try. Oh My! It was fishy, it was sour-ish, it was not good. I mentioned that to the server; he was uninterested.  We also tried some paella; it looked so great cooking at the Paella station that we had to. I didn't think it was that awesome. It was done well, but the flavors were uninteresting to me.\n\nThings that are good/ok:\nGambas al Ajillo: Hard to do this one wrong; nice garlic/butter sauce\nHuevos Fritos con Caviar: If the egg were a bit less cooked and there was a dash of additional flavor or texture, this might have been perfect.\nCanelones de cerdo: Pork and Foie Gras canelones with bechamel sauce. This was good, but again, I expected bolder flavors. it could have been amazing, but fell short of that.\n\nUltimately, my review of Jaleo isn't stellar. What I do like is the energy in this place. I like the decor. I like what the Chef is trying to do. I think a lot of people will enjoy the less-than-traditional ingredients and the attempts at bold flavors. It's a blessing and a curse that I've eating amazing meals in fascinating places; I expect a lot. I would still prefer to be smashed up against a bar with slightly warm wine or Mahou beer enjoying the bold flavors if tapas in Madrid than in any of the US restaurants where I've tried tapas. They try, as Jaleo does, but the food still leans a bit too American for me. \n\nYou see why I'm torn?

Hehe.. yes.. it is like that now.. PLUS.. I am a bigger sucker for Spanish tapas.. any experience that allows me to nibble and share different small meals and something modern, I will be ALL OVER IT.\n\nJaleo is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel and it is a restaurant where it allows you to enjoy a variety of small plates, enjoy authentic paellas, superb sangria, and a wide selection of the finest Spanish cheeses, wines, and Sherries, all in a lively, casual atmosphere. It is definitely more of a casual environment, if you don't wear anything fancy, you don't feel out of place at all which is nice for tourists. \n\nService- Good and efficient. Changes your plate after a few meals which I like when waiters do on their own. \n\nNow lets talk about the food:\n\nSangria- We ordered the red sangria of course full of flavor but DAYAM that stuff is strong. I don't know if they don't add enough ice or they add a ton of wine but yea.. REALLY strong. I could hold my liquour and I was already pretty buzzed after 2 drinks..\n\nPan con tomate with jam\u00f3n Serrano Ferm\u00edn- Basically a nice rustic bread with a spread of tomato sauce and a slice of ham on top. So basic, so simple, but oh so good! I would recommend you get the one with manchego cheese if you love your cheese. The pair with the saltiness of the cheese is delish!\n\nCroquetas de pollo- Traditional chicken fritters.. this was okay. Basically taste like chicken croquettes, same fried batter as the croquettes. Nothing special or out of this world. \n\nChistorra envuelta en patata frita- Slightly spicy chorizo wrapped in crispy potato. This is a must get at Jaleo. It is so cute! Its like little mini chorizos wrapped around by a potato chip and served on a tooth pick. I love the saltiness of the tiny chorizo and the crunchiness of the potato. Together is great!\n\nEmpanadillas de brandada de bacalao- 'Empanada' of cod brandade with honey, delicious delicious delicious. Careful when you eat this cause its all gooey brandade inside.  For some reason I thought it was be actual fish pieces inside but it is basically liquid fish. Sounds weird but its good!\n\nGambas al ajillo- The very, very famous tapa of shrimp saut\u00e9ed with garlic. Deliciously garlicky perfectly cooked shrimp!\n\nButifarra casera con mongetes 'Daniel Patrick Moynihan'- Homemade grilled pork sausage with saut\u00e9ed white beans. Who doesn't like sausage with beans.. definitely homey and rustic taste. \n\nPaella de pollo y lobster- Lobster paella is super salty. I was really disappointed by this dish. It was just regular paella, hardly any lobster meat, and just super salty!!\n\nFlan al estilo tradicional de mam\u00e1 Marisa con espuma de crema catalana- A classic Spanish custard with 'espuma' of Catalan cream and oranges. Man.. the texture of the flat is firm custardy, it is sweet, plus the sourness of the oranges is delicious! Not too sweet which is how I like my dessert. \n\nOverall good and fun meal that is not crazy inventive but interesting to see his take on Spanish tapas in a different perspective.

Think mini food.\n\nThat being said the flavors were spot on and even exceptional when it came to carne asada, the roasted peppers were a great compliment to the slightly spicy beef! My biggest disappointment was with the 'lobster', aka langoustine, which I felt a little lead astray on by our server's description. When asked how large the tail was, she gestured a hand width of about 6 inches. To me, this justified the ~$16 price tag (I can't remember exactly how much it was but it was on the higher end). When it came out, the lavender scented foam was slight, not overpowering, but the meat in the tail was less than that of a large shrimp you find in a neighborhood grocery store. I felt so bad after one nibble, I gave the rest to my boyfriend to try and make up for the fact that I bombed on this suggestion. Other than that, the tempura shrimp were done well with a very nice dipping sauce, and the special (gourmet grilled cheese) was to die for. I mean--how can you go wrong with grilled cheese?\n\nOverall I felt our $120 bill was a little overpriced for the emptiness I still had lingering in my stomach.

This was my first time trying octopus, and I enjoyed it well enough.  The pork sausage stew was really just pork meatballs with sauteed mushrooms and pearl onions - I wouldn't call it a \"stew.\"  It would have been quite tasty, actually, but the meatballs were WAY oversalted.

Nothing overwhelmingly great, but the lobster salad was good, as were the gambas con gabardina, and the endive with goat cheese. The pan con tomate with anchovies and the the bacon-wrapped dates were both ok, although nothing spectacular. And we should have stayed away from the patatas bravas, which for some strange reason consisted of a bowl lays potato chips squirted with sirracha and mayonnaise. \nThe real killer for the evening was the service. I realize dumb people have to work someplace, but do they all have to be assigned to my table?

We were both in awe....we started to feel much better about our meal here after that.\n\nWe then had the liquid olives....how do they do that?  I think the liquid olives tasted more like olives than the actual stuffed olives that came with it.

Loved the flavor of the spicy chorizo...left a bit of heat but not too much.\n\nMy larger dish pick was the Rossejat....paella made with angel hair like pasta and shrimp.  There was ham in there as well.  Delicious!!  I especially loved the crispy edges that burned a little against the cast iron skillet.  It was served with some garlic butter sauce, which I dipped the shrimps in....just heavenly.\n\nMy BF's pick of the night was Secreto Iberico....the skirt steak of the iberico pig, which came with pan con tomate.  This was THE BEST pork dish we both have ever had.  It was so juicy, tender, flavorful....ok, I'm drooling just thinking about that wonderful piece of meat....mmmmm.  Pan con tomate was good too, but nothing compared to this piece of meat.  I think we'll be dreaming about it until the next time we can hit Vegas again.\n\nDessert - flan and some apple tart thing...can't remember the exact name, but also very delicious.  Apple and cinnamon wrapped in brioche with vanilla bean ice cream...so good.

This restaurant was packed and luckily we were able to make reservations a week before.  Doubt anyone was seated without a table.  \n\nThere was only one negative point to our dinner which was the fact that patrons couldn't order any paella they wanted.  Apparently, the chef determines what paella to make and the order in which he does so.

I have to be honest: the meal turned out to be a pretty big disappointment. I probably wouldn't recommend this to anyone with limited time in Vegas, although I have to say, I'd probably go back and try different menu items. Most restaurants deserve a second chance.\n\nSERVICE: This was one of the main reasons I didn't end up loving Jaleo. The hostess was GREAT - she worked some magic and got us a private room (that doesn't take reservations) and she checked in while we were waiting to provide us updates on timing. When we sat down, we had two servers assigned to our room. The main waitress was nice, but steamrolled our decision-making process. Having lived in Spain, I had some definite opinions on what we should order and I could hardly get a word in edgewise. She also failed to get drink orders from everyone and when I tried to speak up to order, she talked right over me. Finally, another member of my group tapped her on the arm to let her know she hadn't gotten a drink order from me. While I knew what the dishes were like, the rest of my group wasn't acquainted with many of the menu items. When asked for what she'd recommend, the waitress blew through several items so quickly that my friends couldn't even keep up to locate them on the menu. It didn't help that she used the Spanish names instead of describing what they were in English. Her initial service left a bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the meal.\n\nFOOD: One thing about Jaleo - this is one authentic tapas menu. I was REALLY impressed. It's a huge menu and there are so many things on it that most Americanized tapas joints wouldn't include. The gazpacho was a HUGE hit at our table, although difficult to share because it was served in one dish. The garlic shrimp was pretty good, although a member of our table got one of those awkward bad shrimp - something I don't think can be avoided. The peppers stuffed with goat cheese (my selection) turned out to be a hit despite no one else seeming interested in it from the beginning. Definitely order that if you go. I'd pass on either of the croquettes (but I never liked them in Spain either, so that may just be a \"me\" thing). They were served in a Camper tennis shoe, which was SUPER cute. We loved that - although the waitress had zero explanation for it. Lame. One thing I would definitely NOT order again was the beef paella. It was some of the worst meat in the paella that I've ever had - another member of our group couldn't eat meat for the next two days because she was so grossed out. Plus, it was SO expensive! Be sure to check the price on paella before you order...and I'd go with more tapas instead. Or, maybe try the seafood paella.\n\nDRINKS: One regret from our group - we wish we had ordered a carafe of sangria. Instead, some of us had wine and some had cocktails. My Whiskey de Verano was AWESOME and I'd recommend it to others. Good drink options. No problems here.\n\nATMOSPHERE: The restaurant, which is totally open on one side is pretty upbeat and busy. It was PACKED on a Thursday at 9:30. But, like I said - we had the  private room. It was AWESOME. It had glass doors, so the noise was kept out (and ours was kept in). My friends who were facing the doors, though, said waiters and waitresses kept staring at us through the doors, which was a little awkward. Oh well. Deal with it - the room was great. It even had a lazy susan on the table to help share tapas.\n\nOVERALL: Like I said, I'd go back here again to give the authentic Spanish menu another try.

Jaleo, for better or worse, hits all four proverbial nails.\n\nJaleo's menu isn't the biggest, but there are a large number of dishes offered.  And most of it is in Spanish.  Unless you read the English description.  Well, as I said before, I have no patience to read every description to settle on a handful of openers.  Which sucks because we ended up with the cod empanadas, which, oh, btw, doesn't really have any cod in it.  It's basically a fish cream that's been deep fried in thin and crisp empanada shell with some honey drizzled on it.  You might like it and love it, but my friends and I could not stomach this to save our lives.  We Fear Factored the shmuck who ordered it as punishment.  Yes, he smelled like fish after that.

The care and attention that goes into this one drink suggests that they care about all of their products (apparently even that cod cream).  Speaking of attention, the food in the shoe definitely grabbed ours, as we promptly ordered the delectable pollo croquetas (sp?) that occupy the footwear.  Those little morsels of what tasted like really good creamed chicken in a crunchy fried shell are really yum.  Another great recommendation was that we try their off-menu paella (I don't know what it's called because we said we'd take it before the server even described it).  To our surprise it was loaded with a whole lobster tail, a giant lobster claw (a bitch to break open), a few prawns and a few muscles.

To which our humble server replied they were not going to be making it.  At all.  For the rest of the night.  Once the tears stopped, I pulled myself together with a wonderful Gin & Tonic, had some pretty good dishes (like the potato wrapped chorizo and roast quail) then went over to Blue Ribbon for oxtail fried rice to dull the pain...but that's for another review.  \n\nYeah, Jaleo, you've got a lot going for you.

Since I've eaten at Jaleo back in my home state, I figured this Jaleo would either be of the same quality or better. I ended up feeling that the tapas back at home were better. Here's what I had:\n\n1. Berenjenas con miel de ca\u00f1a al estilo Malague\u00f1o (Lightly battered eggplant M\u00e1laga style) - This was surprisingly good. It was lightly crispy and slightly sweet. The eggplant was had a great texture where it would melt in your mouth. Nicely done.\n\n2. Ensalada de coles de Bruselas con albaricoques, manzanas y jam\u00f3n S(errano Warm Brussels sprouts salad with apricots, apple and Serrano ham) - I am not a fan of brussels sprouts so I didn't enjoy the first couple bites. However, after that, I started to really enjoy this salad and how it mixed salty, sweet, and bitter flavors together. Nicely executed. The pieces of ham were delightful. :)\n\n3. Vieiras con salsa de romesco (Seared scallops with romesco sauce) - This was my FAVORITE of the meal. It was perfectly seared, juicy, and fresh tasting. The sauce complemented the scallops very well. Too bad you only get two pieces. :( Also, lovely presentation.\n\n4. Codorniz a la Catalana (Grilled whole quail with apple pur\u00e9e and pinenuts) - Great flavor. It was juicy but the breast was slightly dry. That didn't bug me though because I imagine it's quite difficult to cook a quail (such a tiny bird!) perfectly. Nice presentation too.\n\n5. Arroz a banda con bogavante (Literally meaning, 'rice apart from lobster,'\nmade with lobster and cuttlefish) - We had the 1/2 lobster. The lobster was succulent (a little sad it didn't have much meat) but the rice itself was incredibly salty. Even in small bites, it tasted very salty. I think they may have accidentally seasoned it too much, but it was difficult to finish the plate. I was also too tired to complain and the dish had such beautiful presentation.\n\nService: Our waiter was a mix of aloof, aggressive, and somewhat helpful. lol. He really pushed to have us order 3-5 tapas per person and specific tapas that he preferred but we really didn't need to eat that much. We also accidentally spilled water over half of the table, and I was surprised that the waiter didn't notice that we had used all our napkins to wipe up the mess before assisting. Rather, someone else (I think busboy) swooped in quickly and helped us out. The waiter then came by with two napkins, gave my husband one replacement napkin while I stared in disbelief as he walked away with the other napkin. He then turned around after about 10 seconds to give me the other napkin in his hand. I'm not quite sure what happened, but I'm thinking maybe the loud music/business of the restaurant made him tired. *shrugs* I do think the busboy provided outstanding service. He was extremely helpful and attentive. I think he came by our table to sincerely check on us more often than the waiter. We also ordered the paella with cuttlefish, not lobster, but the lobster paella arrived at our table. o_O\n\nAtmosphere: This restaurant is VERY LOUD. Mostly from the music that is playing which in turn increases the chatter level of the patrons. The ceiling speakers are everywhere, so there isn't a quieter spot.

We ordered a lot of tapas (pan de tomato with Serrano ham, sambas al ajillo, pollo al ajillo con crema de queso, salmon crudo, bacon-wrapped dates, carne asada, mini pepito de Iberico) and they were all delicious.  The tapas came quick but the desserts (manzanas Carlota, pan con chocolate and pastel de chocolate y avellanas) took a long time.\n\nThe seats are great.  It was like sitting on and being surrounded by purses.  It's a pretty place.\n\nMy sister has been to Spain and she brought home some Spanish goodies and she has learned to make some tapas.

Not sure why, but it was cool all the same.\n- This place is in the Cosmopolitan which is a hip hotel in Vegas. This place may be trying to be a little too hip. It was too bright and felt like it was in the middle of a mall. You could see everyone walking by outside. Granted, it's in a Las Vegas hotel/casino so we knew there'd be some level of loud excitement surrounding us, just not so much. \n-   Service was good, but odd. We never really knew who our waiter was. It kept changing. \n- We did not eat one bad dish. Some were better than others, but none were bad.\n- Bread was hard to come by. Tapas often had incredibly delicious sauces (the \"mojo\" for example) and it's a shame to waste that sauce. We asked for bread to dip and got 3 little tiny pieces (for $3). It was not enough bread, at all. We ordered a few more of them. This did not spoil our appetite one bit. \n\nA few of my favorite tapas: \n- Grilled asparagus with Romesco sauce - the Romesco was incredible\n- Croquettas de pollo (my Cuban mother-in-law makes really good croquettes but these blew hers away!) Creamy inside, crunchy outside, so much flavor  \n- Papas arugas - The mojo made this dish! Without it, this is basically just salted, boiled tiny potatoes.  Thanks to a duo of mojo's (verde and rojo) this dish delicious\n- Warm Brussels sprouts salad - this had a really nice citrus flavor to it and was like no flavor combination I've ever had with Brussels sprouts before \n- Fried dates in bacon with an apple mustard sauce - like candy. Seriously. \n- Seared scallop with pine nuts - melt in your mouth good \n- Mussels vinaigrette - plump and juicy mussels with aromatic broth - another reason we needed all that bread! \n- Grilled hangar steak with mustard sauce and blue cheese - incredibly tender and great combination of flavors \n- Shrimp saut\u00e9ed with garlic - it's a traditional tapas dish but it tasted better than any other version of this I've had before \n- Oysters gin & tonic - I can't eat raw oysters for a few more months but my tablemates raved about the gin & tonic sauce \n\nJust ok: \n- Pan con tomate with manchego cheese. Not bad at all, just not earth shattering \n- Jamon Iberico - it was from some fancy black footed pig in Spain. It wasn't bad but it wasn't all that great either. It was the most expensive thing we ordered that night  \n- Homemade grilled pork sausage - I'm not a huge sausage fan in general (get your mind out of the gutter, THAT's not what I mean). This was not bad at all but just not one of my favorites  \n\nI know there was more but this is all I can remember. We had no room for dessert.

His Las Vegas offerings also include \u00e9 by Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s (a paean to molecular gastronomy) and China Poblano (Chinese and Mexican).\n\n***The Menu***\nThere are pages of tapas, so take your time perusing the list. When I went, there were a couple of specials; check with your server. Paella is available, either as a single serving of the daily special, or as one of several available if ordered for six or more people. Lastly, a caveat: while a few of the tapas are small, many are nearly entr\u00e9e sized.\n\n***The Atmosphere***\nIt's a large, open space, brightly lit. There are many hard surfaces, making Jaleo a fairly noisy place; contributing to this is moderately to loud music. All in all, pretty much what you'd expect from a restaurant located in the Cosmopolitan. I ate at the bar. It seats around 15 people; the full menu is available. The bartenders, dressed all in black, are very friendly; my bartender was glad to discuss not only the drinks, but the menu.\n\n***The Food***\nI asked the bartender whether I should order a couple of items at a time, or everything at once. He suggested I might as well order everything at once; since there were several cooking stations, dishes would tend to appear slowly, over a period of time. That's what I did, and that's what happened. In no particular order, here's what I had:\n**Ensaladilla rusa con at\u00fan en conserva, with optional trout roe. Yeah, this is just glorified potato and tuna salad - but it's really good potato and tuna salad. The chunks of tuna were a lot firmer and moister than Starkist; dollops of flavored mayonnaise were a nice touch; the optional trout roe was tasty. This was one of those entr\u00e9e sized tapas.\n**La Serena con membrillo (La Serena cheese and quince paste cone). Think of this as a tiny ice cream cone (one large or two small bites), filled with a creamy cheese and quince paste. If you're familiar with mango paste, quince paste is very similar - perhaps slightly less sweet with a slight amount of bitterness. I'm not sure why, but I really enjoyed this one.\n**Fricand\u00f3 de carilleras de ternera y pur\u00e9 de patatas al aceite de oliva (veal cheeks and morels with olive oil potato pur\u00e9e). Two large chunks of cheeks were soft and rich - just the way veal cheeks should be. Just as rich were the whipped potatoes. I liked this dish a lot, but you have to like meat that is soft and fatty.\n**Bacalao (salt cod; off menu special). My bartender recommended this dish. It was a special they started serving the night before. The dish consisted of a generous chunk of salt cod. Slightly chewy and salty, I liked both the texture and flavor. Accompanying it was some rich mayonnaise or aioli or some such thing. If this is still available, it's worth ordering.\n\n***Summary***\nThe Strip now has two high quality tapas bars: Jaleo and the nearby Julian Serrano. I've only had one meal at each, so it's difficult to say which is best, but I'd give the nod to Jaleo. I enjoyed my dishes slightly more, and the atmosphere is a little more upbeat.

It's lighter than most and has just a clean finish to it (Sangria has a tendency to be either sickenly sweet or harsh from the cheap Wine) neither which you will get when you order Sangria form Jaleo.

This little number is awesome with drinks; salty, briny and bathed in luxurious Olive Oil, both traditional and avant grade version entertain the palate, as wells the mind.\n\nThere are so many dishes at Jaleo that are so awesome and deserve special recognition; the Sunday Roasted Pig and the Lobster Paella to name a few.  But due to timing issues, we weren't able to order those, so the highlighted dish is a special favorite in the seafood category, Calamares en su Tinta: Basque style Squid Stew with Ink.  I'm a firm believer that that this may be the best, softest Squid that I have ever had; the Ink sauce was so savory in conjunction with the lime colored concoction which I wasn't' able to recognize, but relished it with fervor.

But food is much better than Firefly - and yes, it should be because Jaleo is more expensive.\n\nYou kinda have to know what to order to enjoy this place. I go there a lot, so I know what to suggest.\n\n\nGazpacho (classic chilled spanish soup made with tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and bread)  - very smooth and tasty. Refreshing! One of the best gazpacho I have ever eaten.\n\nAjo Blanco Con Cangrejo (chilled almond and garlic soup with crabmeat and green grapes)  If you like different stuff, you MUST get this. My favorite soup. I get this all the time. Yummy!\n\nMejillones A La Vinagreta De Miel - (mussels served with pipirrana, sherry dressing and honey)    This item is OK. You kinda be careful when you bite - if you feel it's bad, you should spit it away - because one of 10 mussels could be bad, even rotten. Nobody can tell if it's good or bad - Only your taste buds can tell. So, just be careful. My girl got sick eating one of them. \n\nPan De Cristal Con Tomate Fresco (toasted slices of uniquely crispy and ethereal bread brushed with fresh tomato) - Start your dinner with this one. Pretty good.\n\nAceitunas Rellenas Y Aceitunas 'ferr\u00e1n Adri\u00e0' (olives stuffed with anchovy and piquillo and 'ferr\u00e1n adri\u00e0' liquid olives) -    Good stuff! Perfect pair with wine!\n\nSalm\u00f3n Crudo Con Huevas De Salm\u00f3n (salmon tartare and salmon roe cone) -this is an unique, small stuff that you can eat as if you are eating snacks or candy bars. Interesting. Pretty OK. \n\nOstras 'gin & Tonic' (five oysters with lemon, gin and tonic) - one of the best oysters you can get in LV. Much better than Joe's seafood at Caeser's.\n\nJam\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rico Ferm\u00edn (cured ham from the famous, black-footed ib\u00e9rico pigs of spain) - If you have never eaten iberico pork, you should try this. Iberico pork is something that you can eat medium rare even if it is a pig!\n\nChorizo Ib\u00e9rico De Bellota Ferm\u00edn (a dry-cured chorizo made with ib\u00e9rico meat) - I thought it was OK. To me, it tasted too much - I am not a fan of chorizo. If you like chorizo, it should be fantastico!\n\nSanta Gadea Con Albaricoques ((burgos) a soft-ripened organic goat cheese paired with dried apricots) - this is one of my favorites here. You will be amazed how good goat cheese could be! Very tasty and sensitive at the same time. \n\nHuevo Frito Con Caviar (a fried organic egg topped with caviar) - they use good caviar for sure. I'm sure it's the same kind of one they use for \"e\" restaurant, hidden place in the back (I've eaten there as well - fantastico!)\n\nEndivias Con Queso De Cabra Y Naranjas (endives, goat cheese, oranges and almonds) - one of their BEST appetizers - very refreshing - strongly recommended.\n\nCostillas De Cordero Con Romesco (grilled lamb ribs with romesco sauce and green onions) - this is the only thing that I don't recommend. Not impressed at all. Get something else.\n\nPaellas - all paellas are good - but the traditional paella is so popular that it sells out pretty quick. They sometimes have special seafood/lobster paellas for 45 bucks or so - kinda expensive but it's the best.\n\n\nIf you see my other reviews, you will find that I am a hard rater - I hardly ever rate 5 stars. This place surely deserve 5 stars if you know what to order. I don't care about the dim-lighting for atmosphere at other restaurant - this place is very open and bright so you can take a picture of your loved one! This place (well, entire Cosmo) is pretty loud, but it's worth checking out. \n\nBTW, if you are very conservative on what you eat, then, maybe this is NOT the place. If you like to try new things, if you like to try the best goat cheese, if you like ethnic food, if you are not a grumpy old man, if you are not racist, if you are open in your mind,,, then, this is the place!\n\nService is very friendly and they are super nice. \n\nMy average check is 150 for two including 2 drinks, tax and 20% tips. I've paid only 100 one time including everything. It's all up to your stomach.

Upon reading the multiple positive reviews of this restaurant, I was completely fooled into trying it out. Had I known the quality of the food would be inferior, the customer service would be extremely poor and that I would have to fight with the manager to get a burnt paella dish off of my bill, I would have NEVER EVER visited this restaurant. I wish that I could have gone with my 2nd dining choice of TAO or for that sake, anything else would have been better than dining at Jaleo since I was very dissatisfied and they totally ruined my birthday dinner.\n\nThe night was off to a good start with our drinks. We ordered a variety of tapas including Gambas al ajillo, patatas bravas and croquetas de pollo. Though the portions were extremely small for the price of each dish, they were savory and had good flavor. My expectations were high for the grilled skirt steak (carne asada con piquillos) and the black noodle paella with shrimp (Fideua Negra on Calarmares y Gambas). I was hoping these dishes would be heartier because despite having enjoyed the other dishes I was still feeling very hungry. I was disappointed when I saw the small size of the steak that was cut into 4-5 small pieces) and at this time I started to get upset with the small portions and the price for each (just the small steak was $16). I was even more disappointed with the paella because again, not only was the portion small (and $25), the shrimp turned out to be bite sized pieces (like they'd taken a regular size shrimp and cut it into 4 smaller pieces), but the dish was also burnt! We discovered the dish was burned at the bottom because we were all so hungry from not getting our fill from the small portions of the dished we'd already eaten and were digging into the paella trying to eat as much of it as possible. We were only able to eat about half of it because the remainder of the dish was a crusty, burnt mess that was stuck to the bottom of the pan (similar to what would happen when you make rice at home and you don't add enough water and it sticks). When we brought the issue up to the waiter he said \"I do apologize, but we have some new apprentice people in the kitchen\" and asked if we wanted a new dish. We said no because it would take about a half hour to make and by this time, it was close to 11:30 pm. Plus, I was already extremely disappointed with the food and wanted to leave. I told the waiter we were upset by the quality of the food and a few minutes later a manger came to our table to ask if everything was OK. I told her (I believe her name was Andrea) that I was surprised and disappointed that a restaurant of this caliber would be serving food that was burned and of inferior quality. Rather than accepting fault for the obviously burned paella which was at the table, she chastised us and said we should have brought the issue up sooner and that we had probably enjoyed it because we got to the bottom of the pan and that's where the burnt part was. I couldn't believe she was actually making us feel guilty for eating the dish and not bringing it up sooner. She tried to make up for it by bringing me a dessert, however I was celebrating my birthday and in most restaurants, a dessert is complimentary, so I was still not satisfied. \nWhen our bill came I was furious to see that they were still charging us the $25 for the burned paella. I brought it up to the waiter and he was flustered and didn't know what to do. Again, Andrea came to the table and said she thought they had made good on the burned dish by bringing out the dessert. I told her that I would absolutely NOT pay for the dish that was burned and that I was extremely upset for having dined at this restaurant which I thought would be of much higher quality given its inside one of Vegas's new hotels. After practically having to fight to have them take the dish off of my bill, they did indeed remove the charge, but I was already very upset and felt we had not been given the good quality service we deserved, especially for celebrating my birthday.\nBottom line, I will NEVER EVER return to this place or recommend it to others.

Similar to an omakase, we left the decision making in the hands of our waiter and the kitchen, although we mentioned a couple specific items that we wanted. Our waiter said it would be about $50 per person for the food.\n\nWhat followed was a gluttonous feast of about 13 dishes plus two desserts that were almost all amazing.

Even if you're not a fan of those leafy greens chances are you'll love it. Other favorites were the mussels (much better than the previous time I had them), quail, and the squid, a dish as beautiful as it was delicious.\n\nI could probably list all as my favorites because each was well executed. Some caught our attention with bold and complex flavors while others were more subtle, yet just as refined. It was an excellent mix that showcased the ingredients and the chefs' skills.

The asparagus was tender but only tasty if u dipped it in the sauce it came with which wasn't enough Togo around. We had a sample of the lobster paella ...

Which unfortunately for me is everything on this massive menu T__T The food here is fabulous. It's not just delicious but creative, innovative and exciting!\n\nJaleo has a 5-star selection of cured meats. I personally like to start my meal with these items. I consider the embutidos to be the money-waster section of the menu. Portion sizes are small. Zero bang for your buck but oh so totally worth it. If you're feeling frisky, opt for the kobe of pork products. You only get like 5-6 slices but the cured ham from the magical unicorn pig from the isles of... gotcha! In all seriousness, get the black-footed Iberico just once. It's supposedly fed only acorns and results in meat that makes your mouth water just looking at it.\n\nVegetable-wise, Jaleo makes an amazing warm brussel sprouts salad with apricots, apple and serrano ham. They only use the outer leaves and they're cooked to perfection so they still have a bit of bite. Its a good enough portion for 2 but you'll want the whole bowl to yourself. Also noteworthy is their sauteed spinach. And where else can you get Liquid Olives? These little suckers are a result of some sweet molecular gastronomy. Little blobs of deliciousness that emulsify on the  palate. Sounds weird but I swear they're amazing. They're served with 'real' olives too. I'm a beet addict and always looking for new ways to prepare them. Their Beet Salad prep is 1. different from every place else (no generic roasted beets with goat cheese) and #2 has pistachios in it--the junk food of nuts.\n\nSome of my favorite fried items include the Bacon-Wrapped Dates (nothing special but still delicious), the fried eggplant, and the Cod Empanadas (they're served with honey which makes these totally addicting!)\n\nSeafood: Gambas al Ajillo (shrimp & garlic) and the Squid w/ Squid Ink.

I think it's both.\n\nAnyway, I rounded up five food-loving dining companions and together we ventured into Jaleo on one fine Saturday night just after my 30th birthday. We were seated quickly and given iPads on which to choose drinks. I see the reason for doing this (because the wine list we were presented was a lot different than the one on the web site, so it seems they do a lot of updating), but none of us could really get it to work right (and at least half of the folks at the table own their own iPads). I think I accidentally turned the thing off two or three times. But after some fumbling, we successfully ordered our wines.

We were six very hungry people and we ordered many, many things of supreme deliciousness. The canelones were the highlight for me, primarily because of the perfectly browned manchego cheese on the top. Heavenly, you guys.

But anyway, for the food, I can give in a little for the service.\n\n1st of all, we ordered \"Jose's gin and tonic\".  Because it was labeled \"It's the best gin and tonic you will ever have...\" on the menu.  Personally, I HATE gin and tonic, but since 'it's the BEST\", I had to try it.  \nThey literary \"MIX\" drinks.  They used long skinny tweezers, carefully pick and put the ingredients in the glass, followed by a 2\" diameter clear ice ball (perfectly made ice ball, with no bobble and all clear, trust me, it's NOT easy to make), then they added gin and tonic. 1st sip was \"WOW, it's refreshing!\"  There was no strong nasty gin taste to it, you could taste the gin, just not the overwhelming nasty one.  $16\n\nUsually, most Vegas restaurants take average 15-30 mins to bring food to the table.  But this place was impressively FAST!  The 1st dish was brought to the table within 5 mins, then within 10 mins after the 1st dish, we received all 6 plates of food!  WOW!!!!!\n\nThe cod empanadas was AMAZING!  Same technique and concept as the Philly cheese steak from Bazaar in SLS Beverly Hills.  It was light and airy, but with a nice concentrated cod favor, not too strong, it was perfect!  And it was well priced at $10.  This is a MUST-TRY.\n\nThe grill skirt steak with piquillo pepper confit was my favorite!  Perfectly cooked steak, evenly sliced, the pepper was well seasoned.  Actually the pepper taste EXACTLY the same as the Spanish pepper from Rivera downtown LA.  \n\nPaellas were good, touch too salty for my taste.  We ordered both the rabbit one and the lobster one.  The rabbit was slightly dry and overcooked, but over all, not bad.  The lobster was EVERY FRESH and PERFECTLY cooked through out!  And you actually get the whole entire lobster!  Great price!  \n\nNow I'm really looking forward for my chef's table at Jaleo Washington DC.\n\nMost famous chefs opened one restaurant after another, they stopped caring about the food.  I think Jose Andres is the next Wolfgang Puck.  (I've been to a few Wolfgang restaurants, most of them were VERY disappointing: the food was not even good, slow and bad service, the drinks were not special at all, and the prices were way too high for the quality, expect WP24, but it's still a little over priced)   Just hope that all Jose's restaurants will continuing stay consistent.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "This place is really an amazing stop.

After a 15 minute wait, it finally came. It sadly ruined a meal that was supposed to be a perfect 10. Half of the rice was burnt so bad that it was like eating bitter Rice Krispies. The other half that was not burnt was so salty. The combination of the two just made the dish incredibly inedible. The chicken was also on the dry side. So sad.

You might have caught a glimpse of the chef in the Travel Channel's Washington DC episode of No Reservations featuring his exclusive artsy haunt: Minibar.  The chef not only has an incredibly passionate streak for quality ingredients, but he truly shines in culinary innovation and personality while providing an undeniably eclectic ambience that perfectly compliments the menu.         \n\nThe spirit of Spain is infused into every detail without coming across with the superfluous kitsch one may discover at any Strip establishment.   While often busy, and almost impossible to have a quiet conversation, Jaleo offers a dining experience filled with enough energy to keep your attention without pushing you into sensory overload.\n    \nJaleo, in short, offers a remarkable mixture of tapas, as well as the expected paellas, a noteworthy selection of Spanish wines, cocktails with character, and a kick-ass sangria.    \n\nAdditionally, you will be greeted by enthusiastic and knowledgeable staff with terrific, and timely, presentation.  Created in 1993 by Chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, Roberto Alvarez, and Rob Wilder, Jaleo has not only made a name for itself in DC, but it is slowly coming-of-age as a formidable competitor in the Las Vegas dining scene.

Served in a shoe which I wasn't too sure about, but really tasty nonetheless\nCarne Asada- perfectly cooked and seasoned\nPaella- this traditional dish is an \"absolute must\" when dining at Jaleo! They do some kind of crazy chant in the kitchen before these go out to the tables and it gets the whole restaurant excited. They brought it out on this ginormous skillet that took two people to carry it just to show us what it was.

But if you like smaller portions, you can get very happy at Jaleo. \n\nEvery dish I've had here has been good, and some are dizzyingly delicious, though some are unmemorable. The chicken croquettes -- served in paper tucked into a sneaker -- are comfort food elevated to Olympian heights. The combination of crunchy, creamy and salty will take you back to childhood, if your mother was a gourmet tapas chef. There's a bacalao dish that is similar. Their fennel and apple salad with mancheco is a healthy option that is way too tasty for being so good for you, rich with toasted nuts. On the other hand, the house smoked cheese with nut brittle would be a good pairing with a drink but is only okay as part of a meal. \n\nI had one dessert that isn't on the online menu: torrijas, I think it's called. They describe it as a Spanish style French Toast, which doesn't quite convey what it is. It's like a creamy bread pudding with top note of citrus, maybe from a liqueur, served with brioche ice cream. It's not the best dessert I've ever had but right now I'm having trouble thinking of 10 better ones. \n\nThe atmosphere is loud and a little raucous. As befits its location in the hip, upscale Cosmopolitan, the vibe is, well, upscale and hip, energized, welcoming and bright. This is not a place for a quiet, sedate experience. It's very different from the darker, more romantic La Cave at the Wynn, which also serves small plates. \n\nBut here's the catch with Jaleo: Those small plates aren't cheap. They add up. And tapas, as everybody knows from watching Anthony Bourdain, are meant to accompany wine or beer. So if you show up very hungry and order 4-5 tapas/person plus drinks, dessert and coffee, I'd estimate you could be looking at $150-$200/person. I usually order 2-3 tapas and maybe dessert for around $50 before tip -- if I'm not drinking. I am generally satisfied with that, but as I said, I usually show up alone and I like to eat lightly. \n\nBottom line: A fun menu to explore, lots of soul-satisfying treats, but the price can sneak up on you. I can't honestly call the food a great value for the money, but I love the whole Jaleo experience: the energy, the young eager staff, the feeling of fun, even the bustle and noise. No, it's not a hotel buffet.

They bring pan con tomate to the table to start which was delicious.  We ordered plates of olives as well as their prosciutto plate which came with four different types of meat.  The chorizo was to die for.  The olive plate came with olives stuffed with anchovies as well as this bizarre kind of emulsion, it was kind of a liquid olive in a transparent skin.  It was definitely different.  We ordered various small plates to share.  Everyone loved the octopus and potatoes.  The squid is served over black ink and was probably the largest small plate that we got and it was really good.  We got goat cheese stuffed red peppers, which were delicious but I think the goat cheese was mixed with some sort of blue cheese.  I ordered the cod salad, which is raw cod marinated in some sort of vinaigrette and served with olives and oranges, it was so good! My friend got the steak and loved it.  We ordered a serving of paella to share.  They make two paellas every night and alternate between which one is ready to be served.  The two paellas they were serving that night were a pork paella and a vegetable paella.  The vegetable paella was ready to be served when we got there so if we ordered that one we would not have waited, but we ordered the pork instead and it came out at the end of our meal which was totally fine.  We drank sangria the whole time which was $50 for a carafe but we each got at least one glass out of it.\n\nOur server was excellent, she was very prompt and seemed busy but we got everything we ordered in a timely fashion.

It was tender, rich, and flavorful. \n\nThe Arroz de pato 'Jean Luis Palladin' was an impressive take on duck on rice, smokey grilled duck breast atop creamy, short-grained rice mixed with more duck.

Seriously. I would definitely recommend going to Jaleo at least once to try it, though I probably won't become a regular here. \n\nI will say off the bat two things prevented Jaleo from getting a 5 star review.\n\n1. The Chairs- the table we sat at was one of those awkward high tables, and I sat on the side that had a weird bench instead of individual chairs. After about 10 minutes all I could think about was the 30 rock where Jack sells his awful couches to the government to be used as torture devices. This sounds like a comedic exaggeration- but seriously it was so uncomfortable, and when you are going to be somewhere for three hours a good chair is a must.\n\n2. The service- was very slow. We had a conversation about how we probably would of ordered twice as much stuff if the server had actually come around frequently. Paying the bill from the time we requested it took about 40 minutes. \n\n\nNow, given those two things imagine how good the food was to earn 4 stars-pretty freaking good. \n\nJam\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rico De Bellota Ferm\u00edn- this is like prosciutto I guess- it comes sliced very thinly and artfully arranged on a plate. I have often heard people say \"melt in your mouth\" but honestly I have never really had anything melt in my mouth... until now. The white, fat part of each slice did in fact quickly turn to a liquid when you put each piece into your mouth. Now, this comes with some bread (Pan De Cristal Con Tomate Fresco-which we also ordered as an appetizer) and I have to say there is no better illustration of a tale of two cities than this bread paired with the pig- it is terrible. It was very hard/crusty, and it has what appear to be raw tomatoes just sort of mashed into it. Did not like-although the people I was eating with liked it- but trust me they are morons. \n\nD\u00e1tiles Con Tocino 'Como Hace Todo El Mundo'-as far as I know I have never eaten a date before. Wrapping something in Bacon and then frying it is a good way to introduce someone to new foods- try it with your kids and broccoli. \n\nCroquetas De Pollo- these are awesome- like a mini chicken Cordon Bleu\n\nChistorra envuelta en patata frita - this is a little cocktail weenie sized chorizo sausage wrapped in a potato chip and fried. They are good, but not one of our favorites.\n\nGambas Con Gabardina- these tempura shrimp were hands down our favorite of the appetizers- amazing ( if lobster tempura at Flemmings is a 10, these are a solid 9) and the sauce that comes with them is great. \n\nJos\u00e9's Taco- this is a play on \"taco\" NOT AN ACTUAL TACO. That is key. Its basically a little piece of the Jam\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rico De Bellota Ferm\u00edn with a scoop of caviar on top. It is quite tasty, but not an actual taco.\n\nMini Pepito De Ib\u00e9rico-this was one of the group favorites, in fact one person lamented in hindsight that they should have just gotten 8 of these. Its a little \"wet\" for lack of a better word- I assume due to all the pig inside it there is a lot of grease- and that could be a turn off for some people, we call them quitters. \n\nChorizo Casero Con Pur\u00e9 De Patatas Al Aceite De Oliva-this was one of my favorites- little slices of chorizo in a potato pure- both elements are excellent. \n\nI definitely wanted to try more things (like the pork skirt steak) but we decided to wrap it up after 3 hours.\n\n\nOverall I really liked Jaleo but I think honestly I prefer Julian Serrano- they have a more diverse menu (like those little pizzas that must have heroin in them) better regular human height chairs, and better service. Jaleo seems higher end, and the acorn fed pig is truly delicious but the total package of the restaurant is not as good.", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 5, "useful": 5, "cool": 5}}, {"text": "The chef bangs the bell and then everyone yells PAELLA!!!!!!\n\nAnd with that, I knew the \"Arroz Con Costillas De Cerdo Ib\u00e9rico De Bellota\" (made with the ribs of the famous, black-footed Ib\u00e9rico de bellota pigs of Spain) was ready and would be coming my way any minute.  The paella was rich, flavorful and I gnawed on every rib until nothing was left.  \n\nI semi contemplated another order but then the manicotti/lasagnaesque/alfredoey pork and foie gras canelones with bechamel sauce shut me the heck up :)  My wife wasn't a fan of because it was too cheesy and creamy but I am down for anything foie gras related.  \n\nThe seared fresh squid with squid ink sauce, artichokes and pearl onions was delectable.  Nice presentation!  It's rare for a place to serve the whole squid with innards and all.

Also, it comes served in a shoe (a Camper shoe, to be precise), which is fun. \n\nSalm\u00f3n crudo con huevas de salm\u00f3n - salmon / roe cone - I really liked the cone part, but roe is so salty, so the overall effect was pretty salty. Good, but salty.\n\nEnsalada de bogavante con c\u00edtricos y escarola - lobster & frisee salad - comes with a generous portion of lobster. I do not like frisee, but my mom loved this dish. \n\nCoca con erizos de mar - uni toast - comes with a LOT of uni. Although, now that I'm writing this review months later, I don't really remember anything that special about it. \n\nRossejat - noodle paella - SO GOOD. Definitely a must-order. \n\nRossejat negra con cigala - squid ink rossejat - also really good, but I like the regular rossejat better. I don't know how they get the inside of the Norwegian lobster to such a creamy consistency. Be careful about letting this touch your lips, it will stain them a lovely shade of grey. \n\nCanelones tradicionales de cerdo y h\u00edgado de pato con salsa b\u00e9chamel - pork & foie gras canaloni - the ultimate indulgence. Really rich and creamy. If you are lactose intolerant, you might have a stomach ache after, but it is so worth it. This is such a rich and heavy dish, if you order this I recommend maybe selecting one item fewer than you would have. \n\nOther notes - \nI recommend the white sangria over the red. \nThey do NOT have a full menu at lunch.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 0, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "We walked in for lunch and had a great experience.

The waitress also recommended 3-4 tapas for each + the large Paella dish BUT 2 each + paella was sufficient! \n\nOnto the good stuff: \n\n*Sangria: Of course we would order cocktails off an iPad, fancy haha. Loved the Sangria here. Not sure what was in it but the added sprig of mint made it even more refreshing. Order a Carafe for ~3 glasses. \n\n*Pan de cristal con tomate fresca (Half a loaf of toasted, uniquely crispy and ethereal bread brushed with fresh tomato): aka Tomato Bread. Delicious! Supposedly the bread is imported.It's a great starter! \n\n*Arroz con costillas de cerdo ib\u00e9rico de bellota (Made with the ribs of the famous, black-footed ib\u00e9rico de bellota pigs of Spain): So, the Chef chooses 2 of the 5 paellas to make each day. On this day, there was this one + the Rabbit one (Paella valenciana 'Rafael Vidal' A true classic of chicken, rabbit and green beans). It says allow for \"45 minute wait\" because you'll be served when it's ready. They continuously make batches. Once each batch is done, they ring a cast iron bell and yell out \"Paella\"! I've never been to Spain so I don't really have anything to compare it to. However, I like that the rice was \"crispy\". A little on the oilier side but it is pork. Meat was tough though. \n\n* Gambas al ajillo (The very, very famous tapa of shrimp saut\u00e9ed with garlic): JUST DO IT. Sauteed with garlic but there's a rich & warm tomato-like \"sauce\" on it which MADE this dish. So good. \n\n*Chorizo ib\u00e9rico de bellota Ferm\u00edn (A dry-cured chorizo made with ib\u00e9rico meat): eh, skip. tasted like a dry hot dog and it was on a bed of some kind of corn/polenta looking thing but didn't help \n\n*Ca\u00f1a de cabra con higos (Murcia) A soft, semi-sweet goat's milk cheese paired with raisin walnut bread and fig jam: I don't like stinky cheese but something about this paired with raisin walnut bread & fig jam made this a winner! \n\n*San sim\u00f3n con garapi\u00f1ado de frutos secos (Galicia) A smoked cow's milk cheese paired with house-made nut brittle: Loved this one because of how mild it was. It's a harder cheese but not like parmesan-hard. The nut brittle was tasty s well. \n\n*Manzana con hinojo y queso manchego (Sliced apple and fennel salad with Manchego cheese, walnuts and Sherry dressing): This was a nice palate cleanser. Super refreshing with the crispy granny smith apples + fennel.\n\n*Coliflor con olivas y frutos secos (Saut\u00e9ed cauliflower with dates and olives): Waitress said this is a hit or miss dish but we LOVED this.

My wife ordered the Manza salad which she did not like at all.  She found it to be bland.  The salad was also small but made no difference since she could not finish it because she could not stand the taste.

Had to get it here, it was just as yummy but a little bit more salty.. It comes served in a shoe. When I asked the server why, she explained it was the brand Spanish Camper- the oldest shoe brand in Spain from a small village. Jose Andre wanted to support their company, so he created this \"food on the run\".. haha\n-Jamon serrano Fermin- delicious! Came with little bread sticks and it was so so good.\n-Ensaladilla rusa- ultimate spanish tapa: a salad of potatoes, mayo, and imported conserved tuna with spanish trout roe- after mixing it together, it was very rich and flavorful. Yum.\n-La Serena con membrillo- La Serena cheese, walnut dust, and quince paste cone- wasn't a big fan of this, the cheese was overpowering, usually love Jose Andres' cones but not this one.\n-Ostras Gin and Tonic- oysters with lemon, gin and tonic. So refreshing and light! These oysters were small and sweet- loved it! although we both had a slight allergic reaction to these oysters.\n-Paella valenciana rafael vidal- couldn't leave here without trying a paella! only paella they had left.. it had chicken, rabbit, and green beans, and was absolutely yummy. We finished every last piece of rice haha.\n\nOverall extremely yummy meal. Our server was very gracious and recommended and explained the dishes very well.

On one hand, the experience was ridiculously amazing; it is nice being diners #140 and 141(since the place has opened).  But on the other hand, the food was not. \n\nIt's challenging to come up with an appropriate star rating to balance out the two.  It's also hard since the price was $250 plus tax/per person.  As the previous reviewer mentioned, that price does include food, wine, gratuity, and an awesome experience.  I keep asking myself if it was worth it...I'm not sure that it is.\n\nThe evening was a special one though.  We arrived, checked in at the reservation desk and were waiting to be seated for the 8:30 seating.  One of our 'hosts' came to us, letting us know that we would need to wait for a bit, as the previous seating was wrapping up and they were preparing for our seating.  She would like to know if I would like a glass of cava while I'm waiting.  But of course!  So we're chilling in the Cosmopolitan's fun little sitting area (with billiards, checkers, funky chairs, etc.) enjoying some cava while we wait.  As we're finally seated, much of the busy Jaleo watches the 8 of us as we walk into the private E room.  There are 8 of us seated, with 5 people making sure our evening went smoothly.\n\nAnthony, our specific server, was funny, helpful, and hooked up the wine.  Frankly, I didn't care for most of the wine as it was incredibly sweet.  In fact, most of the dishes had more of a sweet element to them rather than salty or savory, which was what I was looking for.  All dishes were served at one time by the two chefs, so we needed to coordinate bathroom breaks over the 2.5 hour meal.  When it was an appropriate time to go, Anthony walked me all the way to the restroom; what a gentleman!\n\nSome of the highlights of the evening food wise were the Beet Jewelry (salty, crispy, gold-dusted--yum!), caramelized pork rinds (there's nothing like making chicharrones high class!! haha), the smoky oysters in escabeche, secreto of iberico, and, the star of the night really, the Jose Taco and artichoke with caviar.  The Jose Taco was a lovely slice of Jamon Iberico de Bellota with a dollop of caviar on top, to be rolled like a taco (really a taquito, i think).  YUMYUM!!!  And the roasted baby artichoke with caviar and quail egg inside. Divine!  I would like ten more of those please, rather than some of the flowery, fruity dishes we were given.\n\nThe most disheartening thing of the night (other than the bill, haha) was the Whole Lobe of Foie Gras baked in Salt.  I love Foie Gras, seriously.  They showed us this beautiful lobe that has been crusted in tantalizing sea salt and baked.  I was very excited.  We were all given our own slices; they were sitting there, glistening in the plate, waiting to be devoured.  Then they poured an orange juice type sauce on them.  Travesty!!! It ruined the Foie Gras.  The texture was mushy and all I tasted was juice.  Why, Jose?! Why?!\n\nI know this review reads a bit like a schizophrenic's journal, but this is how I feel about E by Jose.

The last group was still finishing up so the manager brought us a nice bubbly glass of Cava while we waited. That nice touch was a great sign of what to come. \n\nAfter our table was ready we were escorted back with the other 6 to our table hidden in another room behind the bar. As we were led through the packed Jaleo dinning room we got a lot of those \"how are they getting that treatment\" looks. We arrived at our half moon shaped bar with a swanky and modern feel. \n\nThis is where the AMAZING service started. Flat or sparkling? My first thought is Vegas's finest will work for me because I'm not a water snob, but then I realized everything is included I went with the sparkling. We were introduced to the staff and I enjoyed the casual environment making it easy to communicate with the chefs as they prepared the food in front of us.

Such promise and I almost never push away Foie Gras but this one was bastardized with a bunch of orange type juice poured on top. \n\nAll in all I enjoyed the service more than the food. Most of the dishes were on the sweet side and didn't have a balance. Of course that is up to the individual's taste and for the price I will be a harsh critic. \n\nThis place is definitely worth a try. At a minimum for the cool and fun experience alone.

It's a 2.5+ hour interactive show in a private room located within Jaleo. After checking in at the hostess stand we were seated at a table in Jaleo and brought complimentary glasses of cava while the previous seating finished (There are two seatings of 8 per night at \u00e9 at 5:30 and 8:30). When ready, we were escorted to the back and entered a space beautifully designed by the Rockwell Group and Spanish designer Juli Capella. Two of the walls are lined with card catalogs with several drawers open and holding artifacts that tie into memories from Jos\u00e9's past. It's an intriguing space that's equal parts Dali, Pan's Labyrinth, and Alice In Wonderland.\n\nIn the center of the room is an 8 seat bar where the chefs create and plate the evening's meal. Much of the actual \"cooking\" is performed out of site in the Jaleo kitchen but the plating is done in front of the diners at the bar. Throughout the evening there was plenty of interaction with the chef's and we were encouraged to ask questions and learn more about the chefs and dishes. It was cool to see them at work. Who knew tweezers and pipettes were such important kitchen tools? Each dish was a work of art... a really delicious work of art.\n\nI'm not articulate enough to describe how creative or tasty each dish was. So if you want a complete breakdown of every course you're better off reading this guy's review: http://www.kevineats.com/2011/01/e-by-jose-andres-las-vegas-nv.html\n\nBut, here are a few notable dishes that I loved:\n- Beet jewelry. Playful, crunchy and delicious. I never thought beets could be so amazing.\n- Membrillo and la serena cone. A flaky cone filled with a creamy, tangy sheep's milk cheese.\n- Bocata de Calamares. An homage to the calamari sandwiches Andr\u00e9s used to eat on the beach, this sammie had uni in place of calamari and it was delicate, briny masterpiece.\n- Cigala with Roses. Typically, I hate foams because they add little to dishes. But here, it added a noticable texture and flavor to the lobster.\n- Secreto of Ib\u00e9rico Pork. The best dish of the night. The best piece of pork I've ever tasted. This was the pig equivalent of A5 kobe beef. Amazing!\n- Frozen Apricot Coulant. Similar to a chocolate lava cake in that you cut it open and liquid oozes out. It's a delicious and unique fruity dessert.\n- 25 Second Bizcocho. The best microwaved food ever. It had the texture of a sponge cake and had a creamy filling.\n\nHonestly, I could probably list a few more dishes that I loved. There wasn't a *bad* dish all night, but the weakest were the two they had to supplement because of my apple allergy. I can't fault them for that.\n\nThe service was exceptional. Truly the best service I've ever experienced. There were two hosts (and I say hosts because dining at \u00e9 is like dining in their home), Anthony and Stephanie, who were able to accommodate dietary/allergic restrictions, serve and clear dishes throughout the night and answer any question we had. It was professional but not stuffy. They're also not shy about keeping your glasses full. Wine was included in the price and Anthony and Stephanie were generous with the pours all night. It was like dining with an open bar.\n\nThe price for the meal, as others have mentioned, is $250 per person. That includes wine, gratuity, and tax. In order to get reservations you have to email them. It's best to plan ahead and email them at least a month before you'd like to dine there. If you're a local, the more flexible you are with your dates (a weeknight instead of dining on a weekend) might make it easier for you to get in. For out of towners, make sure you tell them the dates you'll be in town and they'll try to fit you in. For me, after I initially emailed them I got an automated response right away followed by a dining reservation a couple weeks later.\n\nIn the end, \u00e9 was the most entertaining and amazing dining experience, although not necessarily the *best* meal ever. But, I'd put it in the top 3 that I've had. It's pricey but worth it for a once in a lifetime experience and a peek inside the mind and food memories of Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 6, "useful": 16, "cool": 10}}, {"text": "Everything about my experience at E by Jose Andres was Five Star.  From the Golden Ticket I received in the mail the day before my trip, to the last bite of Saffron scented Chocolate at the end of the evening made this one of the best Food Evenings of my life.\n\nMy Golden Ticket promised, \"Culinary delights that you have not imagined.\"  E delivered on that promise and  more!  On arrival, I was given a glass of Cava while I waited to be escorted to the private dining area that is E.  I don't usually comment much on decor, but I was struck by the intimacy and personal nature of the space.  I can imagine Chef Andres has a study designed in the same manner.  I also appreciate the fact that the communal seating has wheelchair accessible seats cut into the bar.  It allowed me to have the  same experience as the other diners. Now onto the food itself:\n\n1) Frozen Sangria with Grilled Strawberries. Made table side with Liquid Nitrogen, the Sangria had all the flavor of its liquid cousin, but provided an interesting temperature contrast to the Caramelized Strawberries.\n\n2) Spanish Clavel. Hardest item to describe. An  amazingly light bite with a thin wafer made from yogurt and flavored with a Spanish Flower. Vague enough?\n\n3)Beet Jewelry. Rings of dehydrated beet, dusted with Gold.  So much flavor in such a small bite.\n\n4)Caramelized Pork Rinds. Best. Pork Rinds. Ever.  Salty, Sweet, Spicy, Crunchy goodness!\n\n5) Apple \"Brazo de Gitano\". An Apple flavored Sponge Cylinder filled with a bleu cheese espuma.  Another great combination of flavors and textures.\n\n6)Jose Taco. A thin rectangle of Iberico Ham with a dollop of sustainable Caviar. I expected this to be salty beyond belief, but there was a sweetness to the caviar that made this one of my favorite bites of the night.\n\n7)Artichoke with Caviar and Quails Egg. Again, the interplay of tastes and textures was amazing. Earthiness from the Artichoke. Richness from the Egg. Sweet and Salty from the Caviar. Another great bite and I am not a big fan of caviar.\n\n8)Membrillo with La Serena Cone.  My least favorite item of the night. Goat Cheese and Quince Paste.\n\n9)Bocata De Calamares.  A tiny tiny version of a Lobster Roll using Uni as the protein.  This was so good they could start a sandwich shop with a larger version!\n\n10)Ajo Blanco. Modern version of a Spanish soup made from Almonds and Garlic. The Almond Soup was poured over a bowl with several different components including Sliced Almonds, Ground Almonds, Microgreens, Grapes and a Granita ( I can't remember what it was).  This was much mellower than the preceding dishes.  That is not a bad thing! In a multi Course event like this I find that sometimes my taste buds need a rest!\n\n11)Cigala with Roses.  Perfectly cooked Langoustine with a floral note from a Rose flavored foam.\n\n12)Smoky Oysters in Escabeche. The Oysters were smoked in a little globe in front of us.  What actually made these wonderful was the accompanying Onion Confit and Toasted Honey Air.\n\n13)Roasted Turbot with Black Garlic. The fish was the star but The Black Garlic added its intense sweetness and pungent undertones.\n\n14)Foie Gras Baked in Salt.  Best Foie Ever. The salt dome it was baked under gave  it an amazing texture.  A wonderfully tart Citrus Sauce cut the richness of the dish.\n\n15)Secreto of Iberico Pork.  A rarely used cut from behind a Pig's Shoulder Blade was served with Chanterelle Mushrooms and Black Truffle.  This was full of Earthy, Rich, Meaty, Porky Flavor.   It had a texture that was far from soft, But  worked with the rustic nature of the dish.\n\n16)Orange Pith Puree with La Serena. That wonderful Goat cheese reappeared in the first Dessert Course.\n\n17)Frozen Apricot Coulant.  Sort of a fruit version of a molten chocolate cake. This time the outside is an Apricot Ice and the center is an Apricot liquid.  Very light and refreshing!\n\n18)Apples and Red Wine \"Freddy Giradet\".  Vanilla Bean Ice Cream with Red Wine Glazed Apple and Apple Spherifications. Another fun and inventive course that also tasted great.\n\n19)25 Second Bizcocho. A light, airy Citrusy Angel Food cake actually made in a Microwave. \n\n20)Chocolates.  Saffron Scented and Chocolate \"Air\" brought the evening to a sweet end.\n\n\nWe had several spirits that enhanced our experience.  With the first few items we had a Pastrana Manzanilla Sherry. It was clean, delicate and slightly yeasty.  It went very well with our first few courses.\nNext up was actually a beer. Estrella Damme Inedit. I am not a beer drinker but  It actually went very well with our fried oilier items.\nThird was 2008 Mengoba Godello y Dona Blanca Bierzo. Another very light wine that kind of got lost with all the flavors of the food.\nNext was a 2009 Guimero Mencia Ribiero Sacra. This went great with the Foie and Pork.\nWe finished with a classic 1982 Don Pedro Ximenes Sherry.

To all you legit foodies in the house.  This place is da bomb!\n\nOk, now that I have your attention with my lame ass hook, seriously, you people need to check this out.  $250/person.  Not stuffy at all.  A ton of fun.  If you really do truly love inventive food (picky eaters opt out) then you will LOVE this. And at $250 per person including tax, alcohol, and gratuity (although you will want to tip more when you are done) it is such a bargain!  Plus, for people who don't drink, the chefs and servers say that the non-alcoholic offerings are extremely inventive.  They seem quite eager to serve them.  I think they just need advance notice.\n\nThe process: First, send an email to reserve@ebyjoseandres.com with a variety of dates and times that you would like to go.  Give a bunch of choices.  There are only 8 seats, so keep that in mind.\n\nNext, wait for confirmation.  If you are lucky, you will get a reservation and they will ask for more details including any allergies and if there are any non-drinkers.  Eventually, you will get golden tickets in the mail and a very nice note. (Yes, snail mail.)  Yay!  Very Willy Wonka.\n\nNext, show up at Jaleo at the Cosmopolitan promptly.  Anthony (one of your servers) will be waiting at the hostess stand and will psychically know who you are.  Especially if you are the dope with the golden ticket in your hand and a stupid grin on your face.\n\nNext, enjoy some cava (a variety of sparkling wine) at the bar and meet your foodie companions.  At your respective reservation time (5:30pm and 8:30pm are the choices), you will be escorted to an exquisitely designed room separate from the rest of the restaurant where three chefs and two servers will prepare and serve the best food in the world right in front of your eyes.  It's essentially a 3-hour conversation about food, while you pig out.

Just let me say that this is a best meal I have ever had and I've been to Guy Savoy, Joel Robuchon/L'Atelier, Masa (NYC), French Laundry, Per Se, Le Bernardin... need I go on.  I'm a food and service snob (when I expect quality), and this is the best.  I actually closed my eyes in bliss during many of the courses.  The servers, Anthony and Stephanie, are fabulous. The chefs, Edwin, Brett, and Johannes, are also terrific.  Very knowledgeable and so willing to share that knowledge.  It's so much fun and we made some new foodie friends.

We got a Voice Mail confirming our reservation and the dietary restrictions we had (my friend doesn't eat Foie Gras and I stay away from Pork). Our reservation was done on a short notice so we didn't get the \"Golden Tickets\". We arrived earlier and were nicely greeted by a glass of Cava. If this was taste of things to come we in for a treat but didn't over indulge as we wanted to keep our appetite and taste buds fresh and not overwhelmed.  My friend pointed out the interesting name \"1+1=3\" which sorta summarizes this place (more on that later)\nWe were handed a keepsake menu with a rubberised seal (kind like makers mark)\nFrozen Sangria with Grilled Strawberries.  I think presentation was key here with the liquid nitrogen drawing oh and aah from the table. Nice contrast between and warm cold. With a nice a detailed description on why sangria was made that way (doesn't evaporate the alcohol as it remains frozen) I luved the  warm strawberries and might try it myself Sangria was nice at first but I couldn't finish it as I am not big on Sangria.\n\n\nSpanish Clavel. Again presentation was key here taste was not so much. The white petal made from yogurt didn't add anything to taste the centre flower has nice finish though. \nBeet Jewelry. Looked luvly and the finish was intense. How I would describe the bit of potato chips that are left after you have finished a bag and you get a surprise after while. Not bad  (not the intent I guess but awesome) \n\nCaramelized Pork Rinds. I had a substitute course here. My friend did like it though and commented melt in your mouth feel. \nApple \"Brazo de Gitano\". Beautiful presentation. Nice gooey centre. The shell which was fluffy like a meringue had granny apple essence I think and centre was kind like a cheese. \nJose Taco. I had a substitute course and it was caviar in an asparagus shell. \nArtichoke with Caviar and Quails Egg. I liked this dish and I am not big on caviar. Nicely Balanced.  \nMembrillo with La Serena Cone.   Interesting combo didn't care much for it.\nBocata De Calamares could have been favourite dish if it wasn't too much bread and mayo. The uni was the freshest I have ever tasted. This one still made it to the top of my list. \nAjo Blanco. Modern version of a Spanish soup made from Almonds and Garlic. Deconstructed soup very interesting IMO. My friend luved it I was ok with it. \nCigala with Roses.  Good dish with intense flavour of shrimp heads. Top Notch. \n\nSmoky Oysters in Escabeche. Beautiful presentation again very nice flavours. \ncatch of the day with Black Garlic. I luved the black garlic as am a big fan of it. Fish was good I think it would gone better with more buttery fish. \nFoie Gras Baked in Salt.  I was really looking forward to this as I am  a Foie Gras luver didn't find it amazing. I guess I am spoiled by a restaurant that is the Foie Gras Mecca in Montreal   \nSecreto of Iberico Pork.  I had the rabbit instead nothing special. My friend luved this course.  \nOrange Pith Puree with La Serena. Very strong cheese reminded of a something I bought in Montreal. Nice combination. \n\nFrozen Apricot Coulant.  Nice and refreshing. I luved the shell didn't care much for the interior.  \n\nApples and Red Wine \"Freddy Giradet\" nice goblets of wine and apples with ice cream on apple pur\u00e9e. \n\n25 Second Bizcocho. A Cake made in microwave from what I was told. More of technology demo than anything else  \n\nChocolates.  One was with saffron the other was like the fancy version of aero bar. Nice finish.\nWe were given a tour of the tiny kitchen in the back and we could see the effort that goes into preparing a 20 course meal. I am not sure they even break even when its all said and done. Maybe its an experimental play ground for the chef.  \nI am tempted to give 5 stars but the wine/alcohol selection could have been better. I did enjoy the beer (I first tried it in Vancouver) from Elli  Bulli Chef as it did go well with the course.\nThe Service was excellent and we were all at ease with each (4 fellow Canucks made it easier for us as well) the chefs even mingled with us afterwards which is a rarity.  \nOverall I don't think there were many dishes that stood out but the whole is greater than the sum of its parts going in line with the Cava before dinner (1+1=3).\nIts hard to recommend a 250$  a pop meal as value but I guess this one is.

Once our drinks were ordered, she escorted us to a private room where a semi circle table of 8 seats is located. During the meal you enjoy watching the Chefs plate your meal! This is quite an experience, especially because they use many Molecular Gastronomic techniques. The chefs are very precise and meticulous with every dish. In additional to the chef there are 2 additional servers who take care of removing plates after every dish, refilling water, and switching out wine glasses. Service is excellent! Everyone is very attentive and knowledgeable about the cooking methods and wine pairings. There were so many tidbits that I cannot possibly remember everything they told me.\n\nWhile dining I definitely suggest you try on of the paring options. They have a non-alcoholic pairing ($55) and a traditional wine pairing ($110). Both are very interesting. My mom get the non-alcoholic parings and they very cool. Many of the drinks try to mimic actual alcoholic drinks! I personally ordered the regular wine pairings and though it was a amazing. My favorite was drinking out of a porron (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porron), which was definitely a unique experience.

In fact, everyone got two gin and tonic drinks which were prepared very differently.\n\nThe food was amazing. Overall there were 20+ dishes. I'd have to say everything was very good. A few of my favorites were the lobster, the iberico ham and the mushrooms in cream sauce.

The chefs are very talented and are familiar with cooking methods which are not traditionally taught at culinary school. One of the chefs, Mia, even said that she has learned cooking methods at E which were not taught at the Culinary Institue of America. One of my favorite methods was Spherification (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherification), in which the use a calcium and an alginate bath to form spheres from liquids. These liquid spheres resemble caviar, but are filled with a flavorful burst when eaten. It is techniques like this that make this a truly memorable experience.\n\nE is one of my top dining experiences.

That's the first taste of perfection that I've ever experienced from the deconstructive, outside-of-the-box thinking mind of Chef Jose' Andre's\nwhich was about 7-8 years ago, just when the modernist/molecular gastronomy movement was starting to catch fire.\n\nI've been a huge fan ever since that first encounter, and when I heard he was coming to the Cosmo and setting up a \"Restaurant inside of his restaurant\", This was immediately bookmarked for a very special occasion. I made reservations for our Anniversary(September 1st)and within a couple of weeks, we were set, Golden Tickets and all!!!\n\nOur hostess for the evening, Stephani came out to greet us and busts out the i-pad wine list to help us decide on our drinking preferences in addition to the $160-Dinner only price ($105 for the alcoholic beverage pairings-6 wines, a beer, and 2 cocktails) pairing or $55 for the non-alcoholic beverage pairing)I decided to go \"all-in\" and get the total package...my wifey and I shared it with each course and it worked out perfectly. If you're reading this and you are VERY SERIOUS about dining here, trust me, and get the alcohol pairings for the ultimate experience....\n\nThe time has come, and we are led back to the restaurant, and as you step inside the theater/dining room/laboratory, you are directed to a U-shaped counter where you will enjoy your dinner and a show in one for the next 2.5 hours. This room has to be the most whimsical, yet entertaining and inviting room I've ever had a meal in- card catalogs along either side of the wall decorated with antiques and trinkets Chef Andres has collected from Spain and Las Vegas, a vintage typewriter that Stephani uses to type out your bill at the end of the evening...a red face with a devilish grin, a boustier from an actual showgirl, and a pair of high heels going up a ladder!?!?!?...This room is a reflection of chef Andres' mind....\n\nAs we are seated, we are given some Cava ( Gran Riserva La Ticota,2006) which is presented in a Perron, a drinking vessel for wine commonly used in Spain-no glasses needed, just tilt your head back and point the spout directly into your mouth-Totally cool and tasty!\n\nWe were given a total of 23 different tastings, and  they were in this order:\n\n1) Frozen Gin and Tonic(Our \"welcome\" drink)-prepared right before your eyes using liquid  nitrogen, slushy,citrusy, and refreshing way to awaken the palette of what's ahead.\n\nJose's \"Snacks\":\n\n2) Spanish \"Clavel\" or Carnation in English, was a thin, delicate crisp in the form of a carnation with fruity, floral notes which was presented on an actual cast of Chef Andres' hand\n\n3) Beet Jewelry-thin strands of beets coiled around and dehydrated to a crisp, tasting almost exactly like Terra beet chips and garnished with some edible silver lustre dust. Stephani had mentioned that in the old days, beets were used to trade for jewelry in Spain.\n\n4) Caramelized Pork Rinds(Chicharrones)- These came looking like french fries and had a good savory/caramel taste with a nice crunch to it.\n\nJose's \"Tapas\":\n\n5) Apple Brazo de Gitano(\"Gypsy's Arm\") A cylinder of dehydrated apple meringue filled with a bleu cheese espuma topped with a praline cream, a \"cheese plate\" in 2-3 bites.\n\n6) Crispy Chicken Skin in Escabeche- A very plump chicken oyster(that \"nugget\" of chicken you find in a chicken thigh) in escabeche sauce on a very crispy sheet of chicken skin topped with thyme air and powdered thyme,  I let out a little laugh as I was shaking my head.\nenjoying all the textures and flavors of this 2-bite tasting.\n\n7) Jose's Taco- A slice of the king of pork, Iberico de Bellota, or \"The black-footed pig that was fully acorn fed\") topped with a dollop of Rio Frio caviar(sustainable Sturgeon) I was still coming off that high from the previous tasting, I rolled that bad boy up and ate it all up without remembering to get a photo:( luckily, there are pictures posted from other yelpers:)\n\n8) Artichoke with Caviar-Crisp and creamy artichoke heart topped with a fried quail egg and also topped with Rio Frio caviar, another very tasty bite.\n\n9) Bocata de \"Calamares\"- Chef Andres grew up near the ocean, and enjoyed fried calamari sandwiches as a childhood favorite. In his version, Uni (Sea Urchin Roe) replaces the calamari, and is prepared \"rebosado\" or egg battered and flash fried, served on a brioche bun with cucumbers, green onions, and aioli. I LOVE anything \nuni, and wifey's not a big fan, BUT she loved this tasting as well.\n\nWe enjoyed the above tastings with a very prized Sherry, Hidalgo Pastrana Manzanilla Pasada.\n\n10) \"Sandria\"- So we finished up the tapas round with a last bite of sandia(watermelon) that had been compressed with sangria, hence the name which Chef Andres playfully suggested.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 5, "useful": 12, "cool": 10}}, {"text": "Hope I don't need a third page!!!!

Very refreshing soup.\n\n12) Lobster with Citrus and Jasmine- Perfectly done lobster with a lemon pith puree, citrus pieces and zest, lobster head sauce, and jasmine foam. Chef Andres wanted the diner to experience a little \"Spanish Summer\" with the essence of jasmine. This was paired beautifully with Estrella Damm Inedit, a beer from the proprietors of El Bulli, Ferran Adria and Juli Soler. Definitely one of the favorites among everyone.\n\n13) Chickpea Stew with Iberico Ham- Chef Andres' take on Chickpea Stew consisted of an Iberico sauce from rendered iberico ham fat, chickpea \"spheres\",  diced iberico ham fat, and chorizo and parsley oils. (Tasting 13 was paired with a Rioja, R.Lopez de Heredia Vina Tondonia Riserva, 2000)\n\n14) Catch of the day- A meaty piece of Turbot was cooked to perfection and paired with charred green onion oil, micro shiso, arugula, citrus\"pearls\" and black garlic. (Tasting 14 was paired with a Galgueira Godello, NV)\n\n15) Rosemary Wild Mushrooms in Papillote- Morels and Chantrelles were cooked in a heat-proof plastic pouch with a flavorful mushroom broth and a mushroom cream sauce topped with a rosemary air.\n\n16)Secreto of Iberico Pork- Our third tasting containing this prized Spanish black footed pig, this time was prepared with a rarely used, uncured cut behind the shoulder of the pig. I am pretty sure it was prepared sous vide(cooking food in a tightly sealed plastic bag at a controlled temperature resulting in even cooking and a juicier product)\n Presented on a slate plate(Spain's hillsides contain alot of slate, and another element Chef Andres wanted to incorporate)It was a perfect medium rare and tasted like a juicy steak and came with some chicken glace and chantrelles. One of my favorite tastings of the evening.(Tastings 15 and 16 were paired with another Rioja, Vina Ardanza Riserva Especial, 2001)\n\n17) Orange Pith Puree La Serena( Cheese Course)- Torta de La Serena is a soft sheep's milk cheese and was served with a orange pith puree, candied pimpkin seeds and pumpkin oil. The cheese paired perfectly with the Casta Diva Alicante Muscat, 2008.\n\n18) Apples and Red Wine \"Freddy Giradet\"( First Dessert) consisted of grenache poached apples, red wine \"spheres\" apple puree, vanilla ice cream and micro mint.This was Chef Andres' interpretation of appples and wine.\n\n19) Frozen Apricot Coulant-(Second Dessert)- Cold fruity exterior and a amaretto-almond toffee caramel inside, this dessert also came with Spanish olive oil, yogurt espuma, and edible marigold petals. (Tastings 18 and 19 were enjoyed with a \"Fisherman's Coffee\", a drink of reduced rum and coffee.)\n\n20-23) Fizzy Paper, 25-Second Hazelnut Bizcocho, \"Crema Catalana\" and \"Air Chocolates\"(Finale of sweet bites) The fizzy paper was like a pop rocks sheet, the bizcocho(25 seconds in the microwave)  was very soft and creamy inside, the crema catalana was a very sinful bite, and the chocolates were light and delicate. \n\nWe were also able to sign a little black \"guestbook\" and express our thoughts of the evening - wifey and I were Diners #1551 and #1552... a couple of cappucinos and a gin and tonic ended our\nawesome evening.

I made my reservation through their process about a month ago.  While I originally requested the 5:30 seating, there was a singleton space for the 8:30 so I went for it.\n\nI showed up about 8:05 and handed my gold ticket to them.  I was then escorted to the bar where I had some ice water and started to meet my dining mates for the evening - Greg and Lindsey from Glasgow, Scotland.\n\nAt about 8:40, we were escorted into the separate dining area that has a horseshoe shaped table with 8 seats.  Behind the table was the staff ready to greet us, tell us a few rules, and encourage us to ask questions about anything.  Then the dinner started.\n\nOver the next three hours, the staff made some of the most creative, tasty, and beautifully plated dishes I have experienced.  Since the room seats 8 people only, generally four servers each took 2 plates so all 8 of us were served in unison.  I had the non-alcohol drink paring which gave me a chance to have spirit-like drinks along with the other diners.  And in two instances, my food or drink was not laced with alcohol but with lemonade or some other substitute.\n\nEach of the 20+ courses was explained.  We often had questions about technique, ingredients, or other matters.  One of the chefs came out of the kitchen to explain the red mushroom we enjoyed and explained why it was red and whence it came.\n\nThe staff is amazing.  They are friendly, always smiling, and always enjoying what they do.  I really felt that I was a valued visitor.\n\nThe room - oh it's quite different.  Two walls are lined with card catalog boxes to represent the knowledge Andr\u00e9s has built up in his mind over the years.  There's a bustier which know one explained on the wall and a ladder with high heels on the rungs.  Very creative and innovative!\n\nMidnight was almost upon us as we finished the dessert courses.  We then signed the guest book - I was diner #1693.  I then passed the book to Lindsey to sign and so we went around the table.\n\nI recommend this to anyone who wants to try something very different and wants to find out about molecular gastronomy.  It was truly a very delicious and memorable evening.  All the staff at \u00e9 made it outstanding with food and service!", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 6, "useful": 17, "cool": 14}}, {"text": "Let me start out by saying that I'm not a huge fan of Jose Andres' restaurants in general, but this is the best of the 3 i've tried (Jaleo & Bazaar being the other 2 of his restaurants I've tried).  The experience is very unique.  They send you golden tickets in the mail, which you present for entry in front of Jaleo.  They escort you to the private room of Jaleo, where it's \"bar style\" seating.  There are only 2 seatings per night, with 8 people per seating.  The decorations in the room are supposed to represent Jose Andres' mind and each dish is inspired by something from his past/memory but with a twist to it. Cool concept. (For example, Jose Andres used to eat calamari sandwiches w/ his family at the beach when he was young, so he used that idea as a course, but thought it would taste good with uni (aka sea urchin), so the course was a sea urchin sandwich instead).  Of course the waitresses explain this narration to you...I didn't make it up.. \n\nWhat's interesting about this tasting menu compared to other restaurants is that they mix in \"alcoholic drinks\" as a course...and there are quite a few of these alcoholic courses.  The first course is \"gin & tonic.\"  Let me tell you, for a light weight, this thing is STRONG...and made me buzzed on my empty stomach (haha).  22 courses total, all presented very intricately.  My favorites that stood out were: crispy chicken skin in escabeche, apple brazo de gitano (this meringue cylinder filled with light cheese-melts in your mouth), and a white \"soup.\" called Ajo Blanco.\n\nEach course looks very beautiful, but not every course tastes as amazing as it looks.  For example, the desserts at the end were only ok.  Some were better than others (best was apples & red wine), but the finale was disappointing.  The finale featured this sponge (not much flavor), fizzy paper (light, crunchy w/ citrus flavor), and chocolate air.  I did NOT like the chocolate air at all.  It was light in weight, but when you bite into it,  it's dense. The flavor isn't that good; it reminds me of stale chocolate.  Not a fan...took a bite..did not finish it.  My friend seemed to like it though, and ate it for me.  \n\nAs for alcoholic pairing, I didn't do it, but I saw others do it.  It's A LOT of alcohol.  You definitely need a high tolerance to consider adding it (or maybe share one pairing between 2 people).  The non-alcoholic pairing is not worth it.  The drinks didn't pair that well with the food and some of the drinks weren't that good (they looked pretty, but not that tasty).  For example, they had this watermelon spice drink...I don't know about you, but i like refreshing drinks..this one tasted funky and left a spice kick in my mouth...no bueno.  \n\nOverall, great dining experience.  It's like watching a show when they prepare your food.  The total experience lasts about 3 hours.  If you have a low tolerance like me, you might even leave buzzed (one of the desserts has rum in it & is STRONG).

Within a few days we received a response and got our reservation for the 8:30PM second seating on a Thursday night. I believe the best strategy for getting a reservation at this eight seat restaurant is to offer as many time and day possibilities as you can, being flexible certainly can't hurt. We were lucky and actually ended up getting our preferred night.\n\nThe very talented and enthusiastic Chef Mia\nArriving, I felt a little like I was going on a first date.

Stephanie, who, it turned out, was learning to speak Spanish through Rosetta Stone, was having a very impressive conversation with 4 of the guests who were visiting from Spain.\n\nThe menu at \u00e9 is set, usually between 20 and 22 courses which can be paired with an alcohol or nonalcoholic beverage service. Alternatively, one could choose to order a bottle of wine. We chose to enjoy the alcohol pairing, the four guests from Spain ordered a bottle of wine and a couple from Oregon went with the nonalcoholic pairings. This was perfect because we all shared a little taste of everything we were served to drink; that's the side effect of such an intimate dining experience.\n\nThere has been a lot already discussed about the menu items at \u00e9, and I have to say that I enjoyed 90% of the 20 courses  served. Our chef, Mia, was very young, but it was inspiring to see such talent and passion from her! In fact, the entire staff was wonderful, and interacted with all of us diners in a very casual, yet very professional manner.\n\nIf you pass by the \u00e9 door during one of the two seatings, it is almost guaranteed you will hear joyous laughter and often the exclamation \"oh my god, this reminds of my childhood!\"", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "Made it to E on Sept 2nd, 2011.

She sure enough saw me grin through the foodiest douchebaggiest experience of both of our lives and my wife rules.\n\nI won't go into too many details since most Yelpers have repeated them ad nauseum. My dishes were pretty similar to most others with the exception of the ever-changing \"Catch of the Day.\" (Ours was turbot for the record.)\n\nThe chicken skin was memorable. The secreto of iberico ham rave-worthy. But it was the \"chickpea\" stew that made me actually swear a series of expletives into my bowl. I believe I was quoting the celebrated poet Lord Byron when I muttered into my bowl, \"You've got to be fucking kidding me\" and \"I'd eat this shit off of Bin Laden's bloated, decaying corpse.\"\n\nThere are only eight seats, sidled up to a high-top bar. I think that a diner's experience would depend heavily on their surrounding companions. Fortunately, after a few courses (and some flowing wine), we all warmed up to one another. Jose Andres is famous for encouraging diners to play with their food and play we did. Observations were made and notes were shared. \"What did you think of this?\" and \"Could you taste the jasmine in the foam? So did I!\" \n\nOne of us had the vegetarian option and she described in detail her obviously different experience. My glutarded wife requested the gluten-free option and she did the same for the others. I and one other had sprung for the full alcohol pairing, but after the ninth pairing, what seemed to us a cogent and eloquent discourse in which we deconstructed every layer, aroma, and lovingly created component for our dining companions was most likely, when I think back on it, a couple of guys who sounded like the Hulk and Cookie Monster trying to read a restaurant review out of Parade magazine. None of us cared though because we had a ball. Yes, your individual experiences may vary, so I hope for your sake, you get a fun group.\n\nThe service was professional and precise. The staff introduced each meal and fielded questions. They were upfront when needed, stayed in the background when not.\n\nA few final notes: 1) You get to take home a menu, which answers the question, \"How do all these Yelpers remember what they ate to put in their reviews?\" 2) You also get to keep your golden ticket. We actually never received ours in the mail, but they made sure we walked away with a couple. 3) the coffee is not part of the meal. You'll be charged for it. Nothing in Vegas is free, yo. Stupid coffee. 4) If you're on an iPhone, good luck checking in. Or doing anything on that phone for that matter. This restaurant exists in an AT&T blackhole. If you're meeting friends afterwards, make sure your plans are well-defined beforehand. 5) We never got to sign the guest book. In fact, this last note is my only gripe in an otherwise perfect night.

There was lime and citrus but the gin and tonic were frozen into an ice ball. Snacks were up next and the first dish was called Flower, which was a raspberry pur\u00e9e and petals made of raspberry. It looked cool and tasted cool and was served on a plate that was shaped like Jose Andres' hand. Then came the beet ring, which was a very delicate ring that had beet flavor with gold specks on top. I'm not sure what would possess someone to create a beet ring but it was good. My favorite snack was the Chicaronnes, which were honey glazed and perfectly crunchy. \n\nThe appetizer portion of the meal was next. The first dish was called the Gypsy's arm, which was a green apple and blue cheese meringue. The meringue was light and fluffy but the blue cheese and apple were tart. Then came the nitrogen almond cup, which was topped with caviar. They then served crispy chicken skin with escabeche sauce and topped with thyme foam. The skin was perfect and the foam was thymy (which is probably not a word but should be). The jamon Iberico topped with caviar was salty, fatty and great. The meat was perfectly cured and with the caviar, it was a great bite. The coolest looking appetizer was Ferran Adria's olive. It was an olive pur\u00e9e with a membrane on outside and olive liquid on the inside. The final appetizer was the bocata del calamari, which was a fried uni sandwich with cucumber. The sandwich was delicious.\n\nOur next molecular alcoholic drink was a white sangria made with cava that came in a membrane. It reminded me of the olive, except alcoholic and very strong.\n\nNext our show moved on to the dinner portion of the menu. We started with an artichoke pur\u00e9e, which were artichoke hearts topped with black truffles and an artichoke pur\u00e9e. This dish was good, but the truffles were amazing. Next came the lobster, which was fresh and cooked perfectly and served with a side jasmine foam and citrus fruits. The chickpea stew had a rich and fatty base and had chickpeas made of chickpea essence with a membrane on outside to make the essence into a chickpea shape. The mushrooms in paper were served with rosemary foam, white truffle topping. There were chanterelle and porcini mushrooms cooked in a rich and creamy broth, topped with rosemary foam. This dish was great. Next came the turbot plate. The turbot was cooked perfectly with crispy skin on one side and tender fish. There was also bone marrow in puff pastry topped with caviar. This was an awesome compliment to the fish. Next came the salt baked foie gras. When I ate it, I thought to myself, \"This is how food should taste all the time\". It was perfect. The last main course was an Iberico ham steak with squid a la pancha and parsley air. The pork was chewy and had a nice taste. The squid and sauce were great.\n\nFinally we had the desserts and cheeses. The cheese was called torta de la Serena and was served with toasted bread and a sweet sauce. Next we had flan with oranges and ice, which was a light dessert as most of it was ice. The oranges were bitter but the ice added texture to the dish.There was and edible flower and a caramel on the flan. There was a panko un chocolate, which was crunchy, creamy, bread and chocolate together. The arroz con leche was cold rice pudding with a sticky outside. A great treat was the chocolate truffle, which was chocolate on outside but truffles on inside. This was pretty light and very tasty. Finally we had the 25 second bis coco, which was light and springy and the citrus paper which was crunchy and sour.\n\nThe meal was expensive, the service was spectacular, and the setting was intimate.

The details and intricacy of each dish was impressive. (astericks tagged next to dishes I really enjoyed)\n\n        1. Rebujito - alcoholic drink they stirred up and topped with foam reminded me of this drink I had at the Lobby Lounge at the Modern (formerly called Edition) hotel in Hawaii. \n\n        2. Spanish \"Clavel\" - beautifully shaped into a flower and served in the palm of Jose Andre's hand. Tasted like candy\n        3. Beet Jewelry - they said to eat it off your pinky finger like a ring. Dusted with gold. Tasted like beet chips with a savory sweet taste. *\n        4. Caramelized Pork Rinds - ehhh wasn't too into this\n\n        5. Apple \"Brazo de Gitano\" - light airy texture and sweet. we were confused why it seemed like it was starting out with \"dessert\" like courses.\n\n       6. Nitro Almond Cup - wow, this was genius. It looked like half an egg shell with caviar and cream in it. The chef said to eat it quick because it will melt so I put the whole thing in my mouth. Quite a surprise. **\n\n       7.

Jose Taco - caviar wrapped in proscuitto - nothing special, it was as you could imagine.\n\n       9. Olivia Sferica Ferran Adria - olive juice in a bubble so it pops in your mouth and tastes like an olive. they process to make this sounded quite intricate. \n\n      10.  Bocata de Calamares - similar to the sandwich but of course with a twist. It had a huge piece of sweet uni from Santa Barbara. **\n\n      11. Cava Sangria - a SHOT of alcohol in the same bubble like thing as the olive.  whew, woke me up!\n\n      12. Artichoke \"puree\" with Vanilla - it looked like sato imo (small japanese mountain potatoes) but it was little artichokes. never had anything like that. It was in a nice dark sauce with lemon foam dressed on the side.  \n\n      13.  Lobster with citrus and jasmine foam - MY FAVORITE! I love lobster and jasmine so pairing the two was heaven. The dish was beautifully plated with citrus segments.**\n \n     14.   Chickpea stew with Iberico Ham - this was a pretty dish you just wanted to just stare at and not eat. This was a favorite amongst the entire table. It was like a delicate cream stew with garbanzo dumpling like things. \n\n      15. Turbot with bone marrow - the moist white fish had a crispy skin and was complimented well with grounded coffee grinds on the side. The chef was raving about the bone marrow filled pockets but it was nothing special for me.\n\n      16. Rosemary wild mushrooms in Papillote - wrapped in a cellophane bag, this was like a mushroom soup with scents of rosemary, then topped with foam again.  One of the guest had a substitute of veal cheeks since he doesn't like mushrooms so we were all quite envious of that dish.\n\n       17.  Secreto of Iberico pork with squid - loved the pork and sauce. This dish once again topped with some green vegetable foam. *\n\n      Still not over yet....can't forget about the desserts!!!\n\n     18.  Orange Pith Puree La Serena - spooned goat cheese plated with sauces and thin piece of bread.\n\n      19. Flan - beautifully plated with four small pieces of flan and flowers and mint with shaved ice in the middle drizzled with caramel. I enjoyed watching them making this one.*\n\n     20. Pan Con Chocolate - was the least attractive dish but what a treat, my favorite dessert course. top looked like it was sprinkled with dirt but it was chocolate cake that melts in your mouth. Layers underneath had crunch which gave it texture to the creaminess of the dessert.**\n\n     21. \"Arroz Con Leche\" - arroz con leche in a cone made with melted sugar, kicks of citrus.*\n\n     22. 25 second Bizcocho - they said it took only 25 seconds to make this cake like volcano in the microwave. similar to a chiffon cake, very light. Dusted with gold.\n    23.

This is definitely a social experience with the other diners sitting around the bar style seating. I felt just as comfortable dining here solo as I would with a date. About half the group were actually solo diners. Our group was young, funny, and very social. Don't feel pressured to do the wine pairing, although I heard it was excellent only 2 or 3 of the diners in our group did it. Plus we were greeted with a glass of champagne when we sat regardless of whether you ordered the wine pairing and one of the dishes was, as I would describe it, a large sangria caviar. So there is enough alcohol served if you wanted to drink light.\n\nOn the show:\nThe show here is the two chefs in action. Most of the dishes have been prepared somewhat in advance, but they are assembled and discussed right in front of your eyes. Some of the dishes came off like alchemy. Feel free to ask any questions you want, they are happy to discuss the dishes in detail. The 2 chefs/wizards said it takes 36 man hours to prepare for each service.\n\nNormally I would go into detail about each dish but there were just too many and you don't have a choice in what you eat. You just get to try everything. The dishes ranged from good to amazing. I've been to a handful of places that I would say had better food, but the presentation and creativity at work here is unmatched. On my visit it cost $199 + tax, I was told there was no tipping even after insisting. If you are interested or curious about molecular gastronomy then it is worth the visit. If like me the high price is tough to swallow, do what I did, look at it as a great Vegas show instead of a dinner you won't regret it.\n\n*Posted are a picture of the golden ticket you get when you make a reservation, their menu you get to take home, and a few of the dishes.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 12, "cool": 4}}, {"text": "This is quite overdue.

If one were to ever wonder how a mad genius' mind would look like, this would be it.  In Andr\u00e9s case, his mind is a larger-than-life card catalog - filled not with the Dewey decimal system, but an eclectic mix of amusing and whimsical objects that have shaped and influenced Jose Andr\u00e9s culinary vision.  \n\nThe show begins literally with the offering of Jos\u00e9's hand by the night's master of ceremonies Chef Cody Jeffs.\n\nCreated from a mold of Andr\u00e9s' actual hand, in the \"palm\" of the life-sized appendage is a delicate \"clavel\" flower whose billowy petals are shaped from dried raspberry puree. \n\nEating is just part of the fun.  The real performance is watching the team of skilled chefs masterfully assembled all twenty-two courses.  Like a carefully orchestrated routine, everyone knows his or her part.  Foams are whipped, and liquid nitrogen flows freely as dish after dish is put together right in front of the guests to see.\n\nWith only eight guests per seating, the \"third wall\" between chef/performer and audience disappears.

If you're not a foodie and not into unique cooking techniques, you'll probably find it overpriced and won't fully appreciate it. That being said, it was the perfect place for me.\n\nThere were four couples in our sitting. None of us knew each other, but we all seemed to be the same basic type. Foodies who make pretty good money but aren't exactly rich who are willing to pay for a one-of-a-kind once-in-a-lifetime dining experience.\n\nWe all LOVED our food. In fact, at one point the chefs left to get something from the kitchen and one of the guys said, \"Good, they're gone. Now we can lick our plates.\" We all chuckled but all highly considered it. No one wanted to waste one single drop of deliciousness.\n\nI would say my favorite course was the chickpea soup with iberico pork. The \"chickpeas\" were filled with iberico pork and chickpea broth. It was amazing. I had never had iberico pork and instantly fell in love.\n\nI am not a fan of desserts and there were quite a few served. However, I have to admit that I liked every single one of them. My favorite involved olive oil, cocoa powder and mascarpone or something similar. We were instructed to drag our spoons through the olive oil and into the cocoa powder. Sounded weird but WOW!\n\nMy wife is a connoisseur of flan and said that hands down e's was the best she had ever had. I don't care for flan, but I had to agree this flan was delish! \n\nI could go on and on about every single course. But lots of people have already done that, and it would be very hard to truly do any of the courses justice.\n\nAside from the food itself, the other awesome aspect was being able to watch the creation and plating of many of the courses. Everything was done with such care and perfection. The chefs used droppers and tweezers to carefully add the most delicate items. I was in awe throughout the whole dinner and was envious of the chefs who get to work with such great ingredients every day.\n\nAbout midway through the dinner, the chefs told us to look behind us. When we did, we saw none other than Jose' Andres. He was in town for Uncork'd and stopped in for a moment to see how we were all doing. We all expressed our amazement at everything we had tried thus far.\n\nWhen we finished our meal, I saw Jose' sitting at one of the tables in Jaleo. I asked one of the waiters if it would be okay for me to go up to him and ask for his autograph. He said that Jose' was being interviewed by a food magazine but should be done shortly and I could wait at the bar and approach him once he was done. I did so, and once his interview was over I was able to catch him before he went back into the kitchen. He autographed my menu and my wife took a picture of us. The people from the food magazine were still around and their photographer snapped a few pics too. It was a perfect ending to a perfect night.\n\nI mentioned earlier that this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. However, I can't imagine never going back.

Oh my, this bone marrow melted in your mouth and was heavenly... I wanted more of them!\n\nWild Mushrooms In Papillote: you see a little pouch, and wonder, what ever is in this pouch, and then someone cuts the pouch, and this smell emerges, ohhhhh shiz it's morels!! YUM, earthy, creamy, morels, so tasty\n\nFlan: orange flavored crushed ice sprinkled on the plate with a few mini baby flans, together, they created dreamsicle magic in my mouth and I liked it\n\nPan Con Chocolate: Who knew olive oil and chocolate would be so fab together, apparently Jose did, and of course there was a salty element to tie it all together, it was very unique and tasty\n\nArroz Con Leche: Heavenly rice pudding action in a caramelized cone thing, I know, my description doesn't do it justice, but hell, there were 24 courses! I can't remember all the details, but this was crazy good...\n\nI didn't get the wine pairing, as it pretty much cost the same as the meal to do, OUCH, but I did try Estrella Damm Inedit for the first time, and it was super yummy and has become a regular purchase from my local Whole Foods, this beer was created by Ferran Adria to be paired with fine food... and that it does...\n\nXOXO, E, I love you and miss you already!

But then I realized that I had always wanted to try a molecular gastronomy restaurant.  Since Las Vegas is a great place for foodies like myself and my girlfriend, I decided to google molecular gastronomy in the area.  And voile!  E by Jose Andres.  That meant I didn't have to fly all the way to Chicago to eat at Alinea (although i still would love to try that place).  Also, E costs 1/4 as much as Alinea, so it's a steal either way.  \n\nMust say that I was quite stunned when E's website only had a picture of their symbol and an email address through which you make reservations.  I had read that you used to have to make a reservation 1 month in advance but more recently, it looks like at least a few months in advance.  I had only started looking at this option at the beginning of January for a reservation in the middle of January so I knew my chances were slim, but I still sent in a request.  Luckily enough, they had 2 seats available for when I was there!  Scanned and emailed my credit card information and my seats were reserved.\n\nNow on to the experience.  When you arrive (they request you to be there at least 15 min early), you are seated near the bar and presented with a list of cocktails and wines on an ipad.  They give you the option of getting the alcohol pairings for the meal or just ordering a la carte.  We opted for the a la carte since we were there for the food and not the wine (plus it costs almost as much for the wine pairing as for the food so for us, it probably would have not added that much more in terms of enjoyment).  \n\nOnce it was show time, we were taken into a secluded and rather well decorated room with a semi-circular table, around which were 8 seats.  The sous chef was waiting there for us and gave us a brief introduction.  Then, they began rolling out ~22 courses (I still need to count the pictures) right in front of our eyes, using various molecular techniques.  One technique which prevailed through multiple dishes was the process of making purees and/or drinks, modifying it with some natural substance and then dropping it into a bowl of liquid to form identical spheres of liquid.  This was prepared at different temperatures to show that it was stable not only at a low temperature but also relatively high temperatures.  The first one was a cocktail enclosed in a rather large sphere and presented in a soup spoon, and another was a pureed white bean, enclosed in small spheres and presented in a shallow bowl of broth.  \n\nOverall, the experience was both exciting and educating.  They allowed us to ask any questions we liked about the processes they were using.  The portions were just right and we never felt like we were waiting too long in between courses.  We did not feel hungry at the end and were very satisfied with the meal.  Some of the memorable dishes were:  Truffle-flavored cotton candy, enclosed cocktail, turbot with deep friend bone marrow, and saffron-flavored ice cream with chocolate shavings.  One of the drinks that was paired at the end was their gin and tonic.  Everybody was raving about it so we tried one.  IT WAS AMAZING!  I never liked gin before, but the balance of this one was so nice and not too overpowering with the gin.  They used a large round sphere of ice so the surface area of the ice was less and would not end up diluting out the drink as quickly!\n\nAnyway, I could write way more.  there is just not enough words to describe how awesome the experience was.

After a short wait, she was walking us to a table to sit down and review beverage options when she realized we had a party of 4 and not 2.  This was strange since my reservation was for 4, our tickets said a party of 4, so how could she not know?  Anyways, with Jaleo being jam packed at 8pm, she said that there actually wasn't a table available to accommodate us and we had to find seating outside and someone would come find us.  She pointed us to a general seating area outside of Jaleo where there weren't even 4 seats together.  I wouldn't have been so annoyed if the emails from \u00e9  didn't specifically ask us to come early.  For the price and experience that is \u00e9 , they really need to figure out a better way to welcome their 8 guests.  I fully understand that the 5:30 show was probably still wrapping up and that Jaleo was at it's peak when we arrived, but there should still be a system worked out by now that would be a much warmer welcome at this stage.\n\nAgain, the experience once inside made me forget about my initial annoyance.

There were some dishes that were the same, but many were different.  Sitting in the private room with your fellow diners, watching the chefs put together the courses and watching their meticulous plating work is an incredible experience.  We had only 4 diners last night because the others couldn't keep their reservation due to airline delay.\n\nOne of the dishes that I especially like is the dehydrated meringue filled with bleu cheese and topped with praline cream.

I was - understandably - giddy with excitement for the night's intimately exclusive molecular gastronomy show.  \n\nWithin the first few courses, I was eating truffled cotton candy sprinkled in gold leaf out of the palm of Jos\u00e9  Andr\u00e9s' hand - literally.  Or at least, a cast replica of it.  The eight life-sized replicas, admittedly, were a bit creepy when all lined up along the bar.  \n\nThe real show-stopper of my night was the salt crusted foie gras, which made its grand entrance on a cutting board hoisted over Chef Cody's shoulder.  That's right:  one fattened duck liver, cooked beneath a thick layer of salt.  I couldn't help but to squeal in delight when I saw it.  Unfortunately, I wasn't convinced that salt crust is a fantastic way to serve foie gras, and though it was still delicious, I can name a dozen other preparations that I'd have preferred.  Also disappointingly, they did not cut the foie gras tableside, but rather, took it back into the kitchen to crack the salt shell, cut and plate.\n\nWhich is to say, they are not cooking in front of you.  Much is done in front of the diners, but the cooking, for the most part, is not it.  Mostly, its the finalization steps and the plating.  The dirty work takes place behind the closed kitchen door.  \n\nBut that's not the reason for the four-star review.  \n\nThe evening started on a sour note when the host/captain seated us in the waiting area with the other guests who were to be sitting at the chef's table that evening.  They gave us water to quench our thirst while they discussed the drink pairings of the evening.  I happily nodded in agreement when asked whether I would like to participate;  so did some others.  Soon after, he showed an ipad to the gentlemen sitting at the end of the table, and asked whether they were interested in pre-dinner cocktails.  One of my party members glanced at the menu, then asked whether the host had anything to recommend.  I waited patiently.  After the gentleman decided on his beverage, the host was gone.  \n\nKnowing me, my dining habits, and the fact that I would also like a cocktail, my dining companion handed me the iPad, where I browsed Jaleo's beverage offerings, then made a request when the host returned with my friend's drink.  Without blinking an eye, this guy asked me whether I could wait a moment, as in \"a few minutes\", I would be seated with the evening's first alcoholic beverage pairing in front of me.  \n\nI was confused.  \n\nI asked whether a \"few minutes\" meant less than the amount of time it takes to make a drink and have it brought to the waiting area.  He corrected himself and said that I would be seated \"shortly,\" and should not fear my immediate thirst.  \n\nAt this point, I turned my body in my seat toward the captain, looked him in the eye, and asked, \"are you saying I shouldn't have a drink because it really IS a huge amount of alcohol we're getting tonight, or is it because of my size, gender, or ethnicity?\"  I look at him expectantly.  \n\nHost comes to a dead stop.  He tells me he'll get me my drink immediately.  And he does.\n\nSo here's the thing.  I've done the tasting menu thing pretty regularly.  I've always done the alcoholic pairings - and in some cases, will even spring for the reserve tier offerings.  I mean, a sommelier's pairings is generally the optimal way to bring out all the flavors the chef intended in his tasting menu.  Nobody has ever denied me a pre dinner cocktail, or not offered me beverage pairings when they were supposed to, or has ever treated me differently than any of the men in my party - in spite of my size, and the generalization that asian females can't handle their liquor.  This was certainly a first for me.  \n\nAt the end of the night, after I'd consumed all my drink pairings, including the porron and pre-dinner cocktail, and paid my own ~$450 bill, I smiled happily at the host, then gleefully said to him, \"and look, I'm still standing up, all on my own!\"\n\nThen I was off for the night, wandering my way through Vegas for more booze...", "review_stars": 4, "review_votes": {"funny": 9, "useful": 2, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "A restaurant that's named with a lowercase \u00e9,\nto eat here again, I truly do pray.\nThe food was amazing, service tout parfait,\nan exclusive Las Vegas gourmet cabaret.\n\nI don't know how to even write a review for this place. Let me start by saying that in terms of both the food and the general experience, it was one of the best meals I've ever had. \n\nMy companion and I were guests  #6361 and 6362 in the book, and I don't think it will be the last time I get to write an entry. Really, some people have complained about the price, but if you think about it as both a dinner and a show, it isn't a bad deal. Two front-row tickets to 'O' is around $400, two front-row seats at \u00e9 including dinner is about $700-800. And at \u00e9, they let you interact with the entertainment. \n\nI would love to eat here with a group, but it'd be hard to pick just 7 friends to bring. Sadly, an older couple monopolized my dinner companion, and I was seated on the end, so I spent a fair bit of dinner just watching the chefs intently. It's a bit of a crapshoot (no pun intended), whom you'll be seated with. But it didn't ruin the experience entirely, as enjoying the spectacle of the chefs plating and serving everything is a big part of the fun.\n\nAlmost all of the menu items were amazing on some level, but my personal, most craveable favorites were:\n- the vinegar mussels (mejillones en escabeche)\n- the salted, baked foie gras with citrus preparation\n- the \"pan con chocolate\" (has to be experienced to understand)\n- more than anything, the apple meringue (\"brazo de gitano\" ... which, in my limited Spanish knowledge, I'm pretty sure means \"gypsy arm\". I don't know either.)\n\nSeriously... I have to figure out how to make apple meringue, now. \n\nAdditionally, the initial cocktail served was one of the most delicious drinks I've ever had. If I could go to Jaleo and just have that cocktail, it would be worth the walk through the Cosmo.\n\nThe thing is, I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did. I tend to like kind of low-brow food (my favorite restaurant is also a Pakistani grocery store), so this outing was more for my companion who has a penchant for haute cuisine. I read that it was considered one of the \"more accessible\" restaurants by jos\u00e9 andr\u00e9s, which put me at ease, and rightly so. Everything was delicious, even to my relatively unrefined palate. Accessibility is probably a smart choice for Vegas.\n\nDinner lasted about 2-2.5 hours, from 5:30ish to 8, so you'll be out in time to play some craps or roulette before a 10pm show.\n\nWhat else can I say that hasn't already been said?

Surely adding to the meal were the strangers with whom I dined, the wine taking its toll and everyone joyful in the season, and no more so than when the kitchen passed around a porron before dessert - myself missing a few drops at the beginning but performing admirably while some did far better...and some FAR worse...as everyone laughed along.\n\nHaving enjoyed thinkfoodgroup's food in the past but generally not the service \u00e9 by Jose Andres turned out to be everything I'd hoped for; a truly memorable meal that warrants both the price and the praise - a rarity in fine dining, particularly in Las Vegas.", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 1}}, {"text": "Beyond exceptional.

Reservations must be made, via email request, a month ahead.  There are two \"showings\" a night, five nights a week, with 8 diners per \"show.\"  I feel special!  About a week before your reservation, you receive your GOLDEN TICKETS a la Willy Wonka in the mail.  Such a fun and whimsical touch, that truly did build my anticipation for the dinner.  I couldn't wait to show my ticket to all of my friends who didn't care what I was raving about at all, haha.  So you arrive to Jaleo and present your ticket, then review beverage pairing options before entering the hidden room to dine.\n\nService & Atmosphere:  Atmosphere so comfortable and unassuming.  The secret room was sort of like being inside Jose Andres mind.  Have I mentioned whimsical yet?  We had a maitre d, one lead chef and her team of three chefs, and I believe two waitresses.... for the eight of us.  Needless to say, I never had a need that was left unmet.  My water glass never half empty and my wine glass always refilled.  My questions answered before I could even direct them towards anyone.  The lead chef was adorable and personable, joking with us and being an amazing hostess.  It's so obvious that every employee was passionate about their work.  The story that accompanied each dish definitely is one of the aspects that makes the meal stand out to me.  By the end of the two hour meal, I was torn- I couldn't possibly fit another bite of food in my stomach but I was so sad to have the experience end.  The service was amazing, the fellow diners were amazing, and the food was obviously exceptional.\n\nFOOD:  Touched on every sense.  The textures, the smells, the presentation, the taste and the background stories for each dish were just so perfect.  23 courses, including certain beverage courses like the kava caviar sangria... sort of the fanciest most amazing jello shot I've ever had.  How will I ever eat again, if it isn't a dish from e?  I don't think I can manage real food anymore haha.  The food was explained as Spanish Avant Garde Tapas; Jose Andres took Spanish comfort food and memories and experiences and transformed them with molecular gastronomy and innovation.  Half of the fun was receiving your dish, trying to guess what it was going to taste like... and being completely (delightfully) wrong.  The chefs are so meticulous, it's amazing to watch and even more amazing to taste.  Some of the food was so pretty I almost didn't want to ruin it by eating it.  You must get the beverage pairing, by the way; it elevated the meal.\n\nI won't go over all 23 courses (they do change from time to time, by the way) but some notable were the:\n**Marienda--- it looked like the simplest of all dishes, a grilled cheese sandwich I mean really?  But I took a bite and just wow... So the \"Marienda\" is a play on a sandwich that kids will receive in Spain as an afterschool snack, generally cheese and ham.  The bread was steamed brioche bun, so fluffy the best brioche I'd ever had and the only time I've experienced it steamed.  The ham was iberico, the best ham in the world!  Truly.  And some sort of Spanish goat cheese.  For a dish that looked so unassuming, the flavors popped.  I wanted to order a whole box of these just to take home!  \n**Spanish tapas experience all in one.  The idea is that you walk into a bar, you have a cocktail with some olives.  You maybe get some seafood to snack on.  The dish was mussels with liquid olives and orange air.  I'm not even a fan of mussels, at all, but wow it all just made so much sense together.  Liquid olives by the way, are very tasty.\n**Fried chicken skin, topped with chicken oyster and thyme air.  The most essential taste of chicken I've ever had, so tasty.\n**Other tastes: Chocolate paper with dried strawberries, saffron cream, caramelized baguette, iberico broth, squid ink, cod collar, rare skinless creamy Spanish beans, pork & squid ala plancha, truffle & anchovy cookie interpretation, apple merengue, blue cheese cream, almond 3 ways : puree almond shell, almond milk whip cream, almond dust and caviar, lobster with citrus and jasmine air, salt roasted foie\n\nExceptional dining experience, I highly recommend.\nLove,\n#6779", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 3, "useful": 6, "cool": 5}}, {"text": "Incredible.

The merienda (a ham-and-cheese pancake-type creation) and the torta pascualete (a sweet-and-savory cheese dish).  The kava sangia was definitely the most unusual -- a sphere of booze that seems to evaporate milliseconds after I put it in my mouth.  A close second was the 25-second bizcocho (a cone-shaped cake \"baked\" for 25 seconds in the microwave).  Oh?  And the flan?  I've never had a flan as smooth and luxurious as the flan at \u00e9.

I didn't like how dark it was - clearly this was done for mood, but it went beyond the typical mood lighting and was made it difficult to see everything that was going on. I am also not sure how I felt about the seating arrangement. It made dinner conversation a bit awkward (you pretty much don't feel comfortable talking about much other than the food in front of strangers). It was fun to be able to see some of the prep, but the truth is that most of what was done in front of us amounted to plating, pouring sauces, squeezing filling into tubes, etc. I have been to other molecular gastronomy restaurants that do much more theatrical table-side \"shows\" than this restaurant did in a kitchen set up for it, so that was a bit disappointing.\n\nThe food was the definite highlight! There were many stand-out courses (like the salt-crusted foie gras, although the portion was tiny compared to the huge mass they brought out to show us before taking it back to the kitchen to cut!). They gave us a lot of really interesting combinations, like chocolate and olive oil, and other savory/sweet combinations - even when the combinations didn't quite work, they were really interesting (but most of them really worked!)\n\nA tip on the beverage pairing: get the lower-end one. I usually do just because I don't think I'm refined enough for it to make a huge difference! However in this case, I was really happy I did. One of the champagnes was served in something similar to a turkish coffee pot - the ones you lift way up high as you pour. We were instructed to do the same as we poured into our mouths. One person at our table ordered the high end pairing, and they served his in a regular champagne glass!\n\nOne final complaint: This is nitpicky, but when they brought the bill they made a point of telling us that service was already included (20%), but that we are always allowed to leave more, and it is always appreciated. I always think it is so tacky when they do that! The service actually was really friendly, but that turned me off. (I will note that the service was a bit too formal for my taste, especially when you are already sitting around a kitchen. They plated the dishes and then waited for more waiters to come so that they could serve everything at the exact same time. It seemed to be the opposite of the vibe they were going for.)\n\nI would give the food four stars (delicious, but definitely not as good as other restaurants in the same price bracket, like Alinea), but the overall experience three stars.

We were led passed the bar area into another room. It was very quaint, dark and had a Spanish vibe to it. We were introduced to the culinary team. Cody, the sous chef was really good at explaining what dishes they were plating, and what we could expect when tasting the food. \n\nOut of the 20 tastings, a couple really stood out for me, #1 Lobster with Citrus & Jasmin, #2 Secreto Iberico Pork with Squid. My favorite dessert was the Pan con Chocolate. Two of my least favorites were the Foie Gras and the Fabes con Jam\u00f3n, both were so salty I didn't finish either one. \n\nWe all chose to do the wine pairing, which actually had beer and cocktails in the pairing. The alcohol was fantastic, although they were a little skimpy on the pours. Towards the end of the evening, we all felt they were rushing us a bit. There was a couple that showed up 20+ minutes late for dinner, so we thought maybe they were trying to make up for that time, but not cool to punish the rest of us. \n\nReason for my 4 star rating? Everything was good, but it definitely wasn't mind blowing. Dinner, wine pairing and tax and service charge came to $416 a person. It just didn't match up. I didn't think what I had was worth it.

The room is cozy and whimsical, and the food is presented with the perfection of a well-choreographed show. I won't go over the whole menu, but some highlights were: \n\n- the most perfect gin and tonic I have ever had - Jos\u00e9's signature drink. It has a compressed ice cube in a perfect sphere, which still hadn't melted by the end of our 3 hour dinner, as well as lemon rind, a lime wheel, juniper berries, and the most imaculately measured top shelf gin imaginable. It was amazing. \n\n- Freeze dried foie gras with a warm, delicious broth below. The foie gras was so rich and creamy, that when served cold, it was like ice cream. We were encouraged to drag it through the warm broth below, which was the most fun, delicious combination ever. \n\n- Cotton candy empanadas with foie gras and corn nuts - This was our first bite, and we just knew things were going in an awesome direction. Sweet, savory, creamy, crunchy, awesome. \n\n- Lobster and citrus, I don't remember the details, but the lobster was perfect and tender, and there were little segments of different citrus fruits to pair bites with. \n\n- Sangria preparations - the first was our \u00e9dible sangria - whipped to a thick foamy texture, and dotted with encapsulated sangria, freeze dried raspberries, orange zest, spearment, and liquid nitrogen frozen peach puree spheres. So. Much. Fun. \nThe second sangria was an encapsulated cava sangria with pear chunks. You let it slide into your mouth, and it would burst instantly, filling your mouth with a full gulp of sangria. Each diner let out a little cry of delight when the bubble burst, because you can't really prepare yourself for a sudden super-gulp of sangria.\n\n- Lamb soue vide - melted in your mouth. \n\nReally, everything was amazing. I could do the whole list. BUT it's also worth mentioning that I was able to appreciate menu items that I normally despise. I HATE mussels, but ate three of them at \u00e9 - and disliked them significantly less than I have in the past. (It's a texture thing) I'm also not a big fan of oysters, but their encapsulated presentation was fun. \n\nThe ONLY note that I have was that I was a little confused about the bill. There is a \"service charge\" of almost $200 for four of us. When the bill was dropped, the server said something about the service charge, but mentioned that we could leave extra for the cooking team. What does that mean exactly? Do you tip again? Does the cooking team get a part of that \"service charge?\" I was totally confused. I snuck a peak at how much my neighboring diners added and followed suit, but I'm not sure if it was enough. \n\nBut anyways, NOTHING was disappointing. I will absolutely be back.

But we both agreed that the meals at Iggs were ok, but just that. \n\nMy quail starter was quite nice, with lentils and red peppers. But my rabbit main was quite dry. I know rabbit is a hard meat to cook, but it really was a little too dry to enjoy. The steak the boy had looked a-ok, but just that.\n\nThe service was friendly. The ambience a little stuffy. I don't know, there's something about it here that felt fine but didn't seem to shine in any particular way. The menu was a little by-the-book.\n\nI think where this restaurant DOES shine is the tapas bar next door. It was bustling, lively, lots of different interesting things on the menu. Cooking tapas is different to cooking main meals. The meals were a little uninspired and I felt lacking the love and enthusiasm of the little plate offerings next door.\n\nA little disappointed to be honest, but it certainly wasn't a bad experience.

Based on Jenny L.'s previous review, for my parents anniversary (51yrs wed, can you believe it, folks?) - we plumped to check out tapas, as this is a recent addition to the artillery of cuisine my mother is willing to partake in. And what better place than the place I've been eyeing up for a few weeks now? We were not disappointed. \n\nAsparagus with romesco sauce. Calamari. Air dried Iberian meats. Lamb. Meatballs. Langoustines (secretly king prawns) with capers. Gambas Pil Pil (very pil pil, my dear). Bread and oil. Vegetarian paella. We ate and ate and ate and ate. The boy, sceptical of tapas and inability to fill up his bottomless stomach, was defeated. \n\nService was lovely - although one of the waiters seemed to want us to eat faster than we wanted to - but he came in handy when we wanted the bill. Our waitress seemed overwhelmed as it was her first day but did a good job - although could have done with someone checking on drinks - we did have to pull someone aside for that. Dessert also took an awfully long time to arrive - but on an evening where we were just kicking back with a wine glass in hand, that wasn't really frowned on either. \n\nAll in all, had a nice meal here - I think the only one that I found lacked was the paella - could have done with some lemon to jazz up the flavour. Calamari was a little tough, but definitely hadn't reacehed rubber territory. The langoustines were definitely a highlight for me. \n\nWe finished up, stomachs groaning, with a crema catalina - that I was not a fan of - thick, lumpy with strong spice notes in it - it wasn't for me- I have no idea if the consistency was right - I was expecting more of a creme brulee than I got - perhaps another place, another time to try that again.

Usually it's just the two of us grabbing a quick meal because we can't be bothered cooking. \n\nSo we were quite disappointed when we arrived at the restaurant, gasping for a drink, and were basically ignored by the staff. When the waiter eventually took our wine order (white, btw) it took about half an hour and 2 courses to arrive. When I politely enquired, he shouted dismissively over his shoulder \"your wine is coming.\" The bad service continued throughout the evening, and we left feeling that although the food was yummy we wouldn't be returning.\n\nThen I was contacted by The Restaurant Inspector from the telly. \n\nApparently the restaurant had just had a refurb, they were shooting a TV show, they'd seen my review on TripAdvisor, and would I like to come along. Again I was quite excited about the whole thing and spent a day getting ready for my close up.\n\nUpon arrival we noticed the ambience was a lot friendlier, but sadly a lot of redeeming character from the original restaurant was gone. The dark red walls were now the ubiquitous beige colour that those of us in new-build flats are all too familiar with. The wine list (zut alors!) was shorter: we ended up ordering a bottle of Miguel Torres. I thought the food was just as nice, but James reckons that it has actually gone downhill.\n\nAnd then we had to wait an hour for the bill. In fact, if we hadn't walked out (leaving our names and addresses should they wish to recoup costs of course! We aint no thieves) we might still be there, waiting.\n\nI feel really bad writing this review. Iggy seems like a really nice man, and I'm sure he's doing all he can do improve his restaurant.

AZ 88 was DEAD.  Awashed in white tables and chairs, with only about 6 employees and me indoors, this space was too sterile for me to occupy for too long.  Even if happy hour was offered (I asked- it isn't), I don't think I would've bothered.  Impersonal and unwelcoming were adjectives that came to mind.  I will have to come back at a later time in the day to see if a higher body count and more mood lighting help to warm me up to AZ 88.\n\nBack to Pepin!  Happy hour here meant 50% off all tapas and sangrias!  Ole!  HH also means one eats at the bar counter.  Not so ole!  Pepin definitely needs to spruce this area up!  I almost gave up on the idea, but I was hungry and the $15 three-cold tapas sampler had me intrigued.  Si!  That's $7.50 to try three different cold plates; I selected roasted red peppers and goat cheese, lamb w/ garlic and sun-dried tomatoes, and cured salmon w/ fresh onions and capers, on a bed of lettuce and drizzled w/ Spanish olive oil.  I was able to secure a glass of Rene Barbieri red for 50% off (orig. $6).  Muchas gracias!!  \n\nBefore my cold tapas arrived, a basket of 4 fresh-from-the-oven dinner rolls appeared, w/ a delicious aioli to accompany them!  They were so wonderful, I decided I was going to take some home w/ me :)  Xavier, my Catalan server, even gave me fresh rolls (not yet warmed in the oven) to ensure that the finished product wouldn't be rock-hard and damage my ivories.  Aw, how considerate of Xavier!  (Good thing this Catalan was married... I quite favor the Spaniards.)  Back to the tapas!  After the delightfully crispy-crusty dinner rolls, I found the slice of bread that came with the red peppers and goat cheese dull.  Thick-cut and soggy.

I then ordered the Cordero Asado which is lamb and sun dried tomato's in olive oil.  It was just ok not bad but not great either.  I also ordered a paella de pescado y marisco which was very bland and the seafood tasted previously frozen and essentially flavorless.  I was pretty disappointed as the regular price on this dish was $32 I can't imagine paying that for what I got.  So on to the last entree which was a dry aged steak and shrimp.  The steak had been frozen and also was flavorless and the shrimp were as well.  During the meal I was just looking around inside and just kept thinking what if Gordon Ramsey could come here on Kitchen Nightmares and fix this place.  Maybe the owner will try that to revitalize the place instead of getting people in the door with Groupon.  \n\nCliff Note:\nDon't buy the Groupon you will regret it.

Then a woman with dancing shoes emerges wearing a frilly, nylon, pink dress which could have easily been a nightgown.  (not trying to be mean, just telling the truth).  She did two dances and during the rest of her time, she sat down and  clapped along while the guitarist played.  \nWhen I presented the coupon, the waiter told me that I had to order two entrees.  Having read from other Yelpers that they had been told the same, I quickly corrected the waiter and told him that the coupon said, $40 worth of FOOD not necessarily entrees.  They acquiesced. They served us hot rolls, no butter.  Instead, a garlicky ranch type dressing.  I put up with it.  cost saving measure I guess.  My friend ordered the Chicken Al Jerez, a chicken cutlet in sherry sauce.  He didn't want rice so he got vegetables.  On the menu in the restaurant, it doesn't specify that dishes come with soup or salad as it does on the internet.  I told the waiter and he added a salad. The chicken was overdone, but the taste of the sauce was good.  Mushrooms on the chicken were out of a can.  Salad was fresh  I had two appetizers.  Empanadas & Shrimp wrapped in bacon.  Empanadas should be meat filled turnovers.  Not here.  It was made with pizza dough stuffed with tomato sauce and slivers of chicken so small that I had to closely check it to be sure what it was.  I set it aside because it was not worth eating.  The waiter saw this and offered to get me another appetizer.  Nice guy.  Ordered Tortilla Espanola, a traditional fritata containing sliced potatoes, in its place.  It was good.  You can't hurt a frittata. Just dump stuff in the eggs and you're done.  I enjoyed the shrimp and bacon appetizer (I think Trader Joe's sells these frozen)  until I awoke last night with heartburn.

The food and atmosphere was primo, so when I heard he was opening up another tapas restaurant, I never had my doubts. \n\nSome holdovers from Sol y remain -- the patatas bravas, the pil pil, the sol y sombra -- but by and large, the variety on the menu (which isn't overwhelming by any means) is fantastic. Of the five plates I had, I sampled surf, turf, veggies, chutney and grilled bread. \n\nThe trout, a nice-sized fillet for just $8, sits on a bed of chilled veggies in a summery vinaigrette, and is the best value on the menu. The filet mignon, a perfect medium rare spiral cut, also was a good value at $13 considering the plate size. \n\nI wish the cocktail menu offered more tequila-based drinks -- it's mostly rum -- but the Aqwa was something special (albeit bizarre): cacao and cane infused liqueur, caffeine, ginseng, guarana and lots and lots of juicy lime. The bartender told me most people have been afraid to order it, but I didn't hesitate. This kind of cocktail mastery belongs at May's other Old Town concept, Mabel's on Main.\n\nThe atmosphere is decidedly Spanish -- high-energy Salsa music, tiled floors, vaulted ceilings and a cramped but effective bar area. The semi-outdoor patio looked interesting at a glance, and will be a hit on warm nights. I'm glad they left an understated remnant of the old Pitschke's that used to occupy the space -- a tiled accent beam that supports the roof.

It was creamier than mozz, but had an extra flavor to it that I just cant describe. Aside from that I tried the goat cheese croquettas, the lamb and the brussel sprouts.

The smokey flavor would indicate that the sausage had been smoked, explaining why it was so dry - I think the chorizo wanted a partner with more flavor, not the artichoke.\n\nOther menu items that were sampled were the toast with asparagus and romesco sauce, Serrano ham, as well as the roasted eggplant with tomato, onion, and peppers.\n\nSeafood paella with shrimp, mussels, and calamari was also on the menu, though something was lacking with the flavor.\n\nThe highlight of this tasting experience were the Patatas bravas (a crunchy, well seasoned potato with paprika) and the cauliflower in parsley broth (huge fan!!!)  These were two menu items that I sorely missed when Sol Y Sambra closed its doors at Market Street.  \n\nNow, luckily, the tapas are back.

No biggie, but not the best way to attract repeat customers.  \n\nThe space itself is very nicely decorated, it was comfortable and had a lot of details that worked well with the rest of the decor.  \n\nOverall, I think they did a great job with the space, if they tweaked just some small things with some of the food items, they could make them much better and as for service - contrary to popular belief, just because you're in Scottsdale, doesn't mean your staff should be wearing Ed Hardy t shirts and calling customers \"dude\".", "review_stars": 2, "review_votes": {"funny": 1, "useful": 3, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "Great tapas.

If I recall correctly the setup I got was basic booth on one side - minimalist chairs on the other.

Come on!   This is a simple dish and Iruna comes with so much talk: \"OpenTable Diner's Choice\", \n\"2010 Phoenix Magazines Best New Restaurant\", etc.  To not get this one right is just mind boggling.   The potatoes were dry, the dish was extremely oily, and the flavor almost no kick.  Hey, do I see a pattern here?\n\n*** Pollo Colonial ***\n\nI found this chicken dish dried out and extremely salty.

Not sure if the bar is the hold-up or what. Food took much longer than expected as well, since we didn't order paella or anything that was likely made to order. Once the food started coming, we got it all pretty quickly.\n\n\nDRINKS\nMan. Do not order the mojitos. I admit I'm pretty picky about them. I love making them at home. I want them muddled fresh and I want to taste all the ingredients. They have a \"pitcher approach\". It's like they have mojitos on tap. I asked for a fresh mojito, not a whole pitcher. I just wanted to try their mojito, and then move on to an Albari\u00f1o or some other wine. I got the pitcher anyway. And what came out was refreshing alright. Much like ice water is refreshing. Basically clear liquid with some rum aftertaste. No detectable lime. One sad little shred of mint in each pour. Very little sugar. The pitcher approach works well for sangria, obviously. But do not do this for mojitos. Doesn't do them justice. My wife's red wine choice (a pintoresco by the glass) was very good. A friend who tracked us down there after a Yelp check-in said the sangria was very good. So there you go.\n\n\nFOOD\nI'll point out the stand-outs:\n\nBoquerones\nFresh white anchovies in light oil. Delicious. Smaller than I've had elsewhere. A little more body to the fillet is nice. But a great light dish.\n\nRabbit Stew\nThis one gets you bang for the buck, if you're not averse to eating cute little bunny rabbits. Lots of tender delicious sweet meat in a light tomato broth with a nice acid too it. Bone-in meat ensured lots of flavor.\n\nShrimp a la Plancha (or whatever they called it)\nHead-on, shell-on shrimp. Messy to eat unless you crunch the whole shell. Not quite crispy enough to allow for that though. So mostly we peeled them. Quality white shrimp with real shrimp flavor. Not the rubber you so often get with grilled shrimp.\n\nOxtail Stew\nThis should be so up my alley. Classic mirepoix dark stew flavor. Did I detect a little store-bought demi-glace starter? But it could have been braised a bit longer. Like a couple more hours. There was still too much un-rendered fat and connective stuff; not enough meat.\n\nBasque Sausage\nNot memorable. If you've ever gotten the Spanish Chorizo from Schreiner's, or LaTienda.com, you'll know what I wish it was like. When we get the Schreiner's, it never makes it through the car ride home.\n\nMix of Snails, Sausage and something else\nDidn't do it for us. No individual character to each of the proteins. Just a mash-up of savory chewy bits. Be a pretty good starter bread dip if you were hungry, but not a great dish.\n\nPan con Tomate (pan boli?)\nFor me, this is a benchmark item. This would have been better if the bread had more chewiness and structure to it.\n\nAnd of course they have all the stand-bys like Potatas Bravas, Fried Squid, etc. And Paella. Next time, I'm trying the Valenciana for sure. That alone could add a star if the flavors are there. But there better be smokiness, bone-in dark meat chicken and the rice better be crispy on the bottom of the pan.\n\n\nSo, just A-OK for now.\n\nI could see an updated 4 star review once...\n a) I've further explored the menu and know what all the gems are, and learn what to avoid, for my taste.\n\n b) they fine-tune the service and hopefully work on the authenticity. the crowd that was there and the location don't give me much hope for tuning toward the more authentic. if anything, i fear it being dumbed down even more.", "review_stars": 3, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 7, "cool": 3}}, {"text": "Let me start by saying that I was very excited thinking about a new Spanish restaurant in town as they are few and far between around here. Having traveled quite a bit in Spain we are huge fans of tapas and paella. So we went to Tapas Papa Frita with great anticipation for a delicious meal. I am sad to say that this restaurant was a complete letdown for a variety of reasons. \n\nThe restaurant itself is absolutely lovely. I loved the way the place was decorated with representation of Joan Miro's work, since he is one of my all time favorite artists. The restaurant presents itself very nicely. \n\nWe decided to try this restaurant also because their website advertised \"During the month of August...everything on the menu will be buy one and receive the second one at no charge\" for happy hour 5-7pm. Our interpretation of this was that you could buy one item and choose another item for free. The reality was that it was buy one item and get a double portion. This was not clearly worded on their website. \n\nWe sat at the bar and were immediately met with a pretentious attitude form the bar tender which is typical, but unfortunate, in many Scottsdale restaurants. He became more rude when he found out we did not want to order drinks.  This makes no sense to me because the meals cost quite a bit more than drinks would have so it's not like his tip would have suffered. After that he left us to sit for a very long time before taking our order. So long in fact that the manager had to come around to see why our order hadn't been taken. The bartender finally came around after a prompting from his manager and took our order. \n\nWe ordered Txipirones en su Pinto (stuffed squid) and Alcachofa a la Romana (fried artichokes) for our tapas. For dinner we ordered the Paella Valenciana for our entree, to be shared since it was double portion. The fried artichokes arrived on the cool side and the batter was soggy. As I pulled the batter away from one of the artichokes I could taste that it was a marinated artichoke, which was clearly canned or jarred. The appetizer was soggy and unappealing. The stuffed squid arrived and for a \"double portion\" as the happy hour special stated, we received 3 squid. My question is what is the full sized portion? 1.5 squid? The squid was tasty, it was served in what I'm assuming was a blank ink sauce with a spicy tomato sauce on the side. This was the only redeemable part of our meal, it really was quite good. The bread and aioli that was served before the meal was also very good. \n\nOn to the entree, our \"double portion\" of the Paella Valenciana. I should say that we've eaten enough tapas and paella in Spain to where we have a very good idea what to expect from these classic dishes. This was not authentic Spanish paella. First it's impossible that it be truly authentic since it came out in about 15 minutes, traditional paella takes at least 45 minutes to prepare. It was served in a cast iron skillet but it did not have that chewy, crunchy texture that paella has when it's actually finished in the oven. The rice was on the firmer side when it should be mushy and there was a flavorless watery broth whereas true paella should be rich with saffron flavor and the rice should have absorbed any liquid that it was cooked in. The sausage that it was prepared with was tasty but incredibly salty. The chicken was dark meat which I found disappointing. The shellfish was fine, albeit the shrimp were overcooked. Overall I am very sad to say that it was a terrible dish of paella, it was not authentic and not even really worth eating which is why we left a third of it behind. \n\nLastly, the restaurant was very warm and the bathrooms appeared to have no air conditioning or the vents were closed. It was 110 degrees today and they had 2 doors right by the bar where we were sitting propped wide open. I understand that it's a new restaurant and they wanted passersby to know that they were open; however, in this day of eco-consciousness, I found this to be an unconscionable waste of energy. Moreover it made the restaurant very warm and uncomfortable. So in my opinion the doors being open resulted in a lose lose situation. \n\nThankfully our bill was low due to the \"double portion\" special because I would have been incredibly disgruntled had we paid full price for bad food and bad service. I think Tapas Papa Frita has a nice concept, but they are definitely not ready for prime time.  I can tolerate a pretentious Scottsdale restaurant when the food is dynamite, but this is not the case at Tapas Papa Frita. It's both pretentious and serves bad food. It's a pity because the place is lovely. I hope they pull it together so they can stay in business, but we will not be returning here.\n\nPS* patxi g. who reviewed right below clearly works for this place as he reiterated the same bad wording of the happy hour special and the review seems overly phony.", "review_stars": 1, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}, {"text": "I would like to start by saying WOW!

We were seated quickly and our waitress was VERY good.  \nHad a pitcher of the white sangria- totally refreshing and went well the the rolls they serve before dinner.  Their aioli that comes with the rolls is SO good and very light.  I could (and was) eat it with a spoon.\nWe only did tapas, although the waitress SWORE by the paella.   We followed the pitcher of sangria with a pitcher of mojito.  A little weak, but you get a ton for $9 so no complaints.  In fact I found the lighter mojito paired well with the food and you could drink more.  There were only two of us, so we didn't even finish it.\nThe prices on the tapas are really low.  Like most dishes being in the 5-7 dollar range.  You get a decent amount for that.\nWe got the Spanish tortilla-which came with more aioli.  It was a nice wedge of eggy-potatoey goodness served at the perfect temp.  Very filling for under $5. A great side to the meat dishes.\nWe also ordered the crab-stuffed red peppers with saffron sauce.  The saffron sauce was a little light for my tastes, but good.  The peppers were well cooked, well cleaned (I HATE skin on red peppers) and really worked with the crab.  Only $7.\nWe also tried the pork loin wrapped in bacon and in a sauce made with almonds.  Super tender pork but still not to dry.  I had not had a similar sauce before, very nice.  Again pretty light.  My wife ate most of it because at this point I was getting very full but still really wanted to try the oxtail.  I was glad I had saved room.  The sauce was so rich and smokey and it came out piping hot.  I could really go on and on about the sauce.  I got a HUGE piece of oxtail which I ended up having to just pick up and chew on.  Oxtail is always a pain and I praise the waitress for telling me to just go for it and pick it up.  \nAll in all we spent $50 and got really drunk and really fed.

Everyone enjoyed themselves and everyone loved the food.  Including my friend Chris, who tends to be a picky eater.\nWe went on Saturday so the evening started with a very good guitar player and that slowly grew into a band w/ two dancers.  I usually don't dig live bands while I'm eating too much, but these guys were great.  They even invited our table up for a little dancing lesson as our waitress had informed them that it was my birthday.  Being generally shy both me and Chris refused, but both of the gals went up and it was really fun.  We had the same waitress as last time, Laura, and she was VERY sweet and knowledgeable.  But, let's get to the important part, the food.\nHere's what we had-\n\nAgain I have to mention the awesome rolls and garlic aioli they bring out to start off.  So awesome and a hit all around.   My friends had never had aioli so they were VERY happy.\n\nCaracoles aioli (glazed escargot in sherry vinegar aioli)- these were awesome.  Usually places try to completely mask the taste of the snails themselves with a strong garlic/butter type sauce or something similar.  This sauce was very light and that awesome earthy/woodsy flavor of the snails really came through.  My picky friend just kept coming back to these.  Usually he'll try something considered \"adventurous\" like snails but rarely has seconds.\n\nMy fiend ordered one of  the chicken dishes, but I did not try it.  It was the Pollo a la Cazadora (Garlic chicken casserole with potatoes and carrots).  The other three people at my table tried it and they all liked it.  My friend said it was only slightly spicy.\nTxistorra (basque sausage with sherry)- This was pretty straight forward.  A hit all around.  Again the picky eater came back to these over and over.\n\nSolomillo de Cordo con Tocino (pork tenderloin with bacon, almonds and spices).  My wife and I liked this.  One of my friends said it was just \"OK\" and one of them hated it.  \n\nSomeone had a beef dish.  If I remember correctly it was Espada de Solomillo (beef tenderloin with Sherry and sauteed onions) but don't quote me.  It was beef on skewers.  Everyone except me liked this.  In all fairness it's just that I hate cumin and it had a very strong cumin flavor.  The beef was tender and well seasoned, I just didn't like the seasoning.\n\nPincho Muruno (Moroccan style lamb brochette)- This was really good.  Again, it had cumin, but not enough to turn me off.  The lamb was really well cooked and  very tasty.  Everyone liked this dish.  \n\nWe had the the Tortillas de Patatas (Spanish potato pie) again.   Just like the rolls with aioli I can't really express how great this really is.   Just eggy potato and onion paradise with aioli.  Under $5 and it was generally agreed to that it was the best thing we got.  You HAVE to order this, especially at the price.\n\nI also got the Ensalada de atun con Tomate, a salad with tomatoes and bonito tuna.  Most people liked it.  I myself found the vinegar WAY too overpowering.  But it was nice to see bonito tuna on a menu, not so common.\n\nWe all shared a couple of pitchers of the Vino Verde Sangria- the white wine sangria.  Very nice. \n\nSo all that food and two of the large pitchers of sangria came to just over $100.  So awesome.  We also stayed a little to listen to the music so I wandered over to the bar for a 7 and 7.  I was served quickly and I got a VERY stiff 7 and 7 for $8 even.

He was very helpful since we weren't sure we wanted a full heavy meal, so the waiter recommended around 4-6 tapas plates and he would just bring them out 2 at a time. He also recommended a phenomenal wine. We had the meatballs, braised oxtail, aoli papas, croquetas, and lamb chops. Everything was amazing.

I even thought about it for week before I did, but they have done themselves in here! My honey and I went last Saturday for \"happy hour\".  I love tapas and haven't been able to find a great spot since Sol y Sombra shut down, so we thought we would give them a try.  It was a beautiful evening, and they offer a 2-4-1 happy hour on the patio or in the bar.  \n  So we spent two hours enjoying their delicious tapas, wine, sangria, and even dessert and coffee.  Food and drink were both amazing, and the service was attentive and gracious.  Sadly, thats as glowing as this review is gonna get because they have royally pissed me off.\n  Where they really went wrong was with what happened after.  So we got our \"happy hour\" tab, signed the receipt, and left.  I have to admit this was partially my fault because I tend to sign credit card slips with reckless abandon and utter disregard for the total(denial is not just a river in Egypt people), which was in this case, $93 plus a $20 tip.\n  So we get home, still talking about how delicious everything was, and I casually throw the receipt on the counter.  The sangria has now worn off.... $93? For happy hour? Yikes.  So apparently our server neglected to price our drinks out at happy hour pricing.  And the servings had been pretty small, even for tapas, certainly not the double portions that are supposed to arrive between 5 and 7.  So I called the restaurant immediately.  Having worked in restaurants before, I usually pick my battles, but since we had gone for happy hour intentionally based on what we read on Yelp, this called for attention.\n  SO I called the restaurant right away, and was apologized to profusely. Yes, I was correct, we had not received the happy hour portions that we should have ( which was probably why we ordered so many tapas) and we were charged double what we should have been for our drinks.  The sweet guy on the phone informed me that there was no manager available as it was a busy time on Saturday night, but that they would certainly make this right, and a manager would call me tomorrow.  Seemed reasonable so I gave them my number and waited.  Sunday, no call.  So Monday I called and left another messgae. Tuesday, still no call.  So I emailed them. \n  So a week later, no call, no email, nothing.  Like I said, I really don't want to give these guys a bad write up, but this is just about the worst customer service I have encoutered in a while. I personally will not return, despite a craving for their crab stuffed peppers.  If you want to chance it, go ahead, you will have a great time but will certainly pay for it! \n It's really a shame because stuff like this is why otherwise great places seem to cycle in and out of this area way to fast.", "review_stars": 1, "review_votes": {"funny": 2, "useful": 11, "cool": 2}}, {"text": "Last year we went to Spain.

Especially given the above. I wanted to indulge!\n\nExpectations were fairly low--it's in Scottsdale. Authentic tapas we were not planning to find, but the menu had promise.

Heck no, the ingredients we have here in the US *are* going to be different. But it was darn close. The menu was crazily extensive, the red sangria was strong, and the staff was super friendly. \n\nWe ordered up a plethora of tapas and skipped the big plates, sad because they also looked promising but it was just the two of us. Split the banana chocolate bread pudding for dessert. Wished they served real Spanish hot chocolate. Had to laugh at some of the ways they served things--aka calamari came with 3 dipping sauces. In Madrid, they looked at you like you had 3 heads if you asked for sauces to dip. It's very American. But I love me some sauce.\n\nSecond surprise. The live Spanish guitar and flamenco show on the small stage. We thought it would be all cheese. Wrong. The guitarist was amazing and the flamenco dancers were spot on and had the same passion. You could almost close your eyes and imagine you were back in Madrid seeing it for reals. If it wasn't for the trio of English speaking cougars at the bar, that is.\n\nThe outfits the staff have to wear are ridiculously cheesy and it is in a strip mall--typical of 99% of the good restaurants in Scottsdale.

Our server actually suggested one of the other labels which was wine spectator rated, and I was resistant - so, he comes by with a sample taste just to prove his point.

I always get a kick from trying to visualize what fun flavors can be produced from these \"exotic\" ingredients.\n\nIn my humble book, I tend to base my Spanish experience on one dish and one dish only and that is the glorious Paella!  For me, this is a deal breaker!  The pricing was fair and reasonable, but the quality fell quite short! The classic Valencia was simply, too watery! History tells me it should be fluffier, creamier and rich in flavor! On the other hand, the Arros Negre, was more pleasing and entertaining!

Unfortunately, we did not have reservations and so although the patio was complete empty when we arrived, we were told by the host (owner?) in a very condecending way that all the tables on the patio were reserved and so we would have to be seated inside. That dampened my spirits a little but I was still anticipating an enjoyable evening with my hubby and some good food. To start off, we ordered a pitcher of Sangria to share and some soup. Sangria arrived first in a surprisingly small pitcher. I could not believe that small pitcher was $22!  It turned out to be a good thing since it was so bad, neither one of us wanted to drink it. It was by far the worst Sangria I have ever had. It tasted like it was 1/2 cheap red wine and 1/2 club soda. Not sweet, not fruity. Instead of bright refreshing slices of citrus and other fruits there were a few bits of orange rind and a couple of pieces of some other fruit that had been diced so small it was unrecognizable. I ordered the gazpacho which was pretty good although I prefer it chunky rather than pureed and my husband got the seafood stew. That had a good flavor to it but the seafood in it was very overcooked. \n\nWe decided not to order any tapas with seafood in them after seeing the quality that was in the soup. We selected three Tapas to start with: the beef tenderloin, the leek tart, and the potato tortilla. The beef was pretty good, nothing special about it but it had a good flavor. The leek tart was not so great but the sauce it came with was delicious and we mopped it up with the bread in the bread basket. The tortilla was disappointing. To me this is the quintessential tapa dish so I was expecting it to be great but it was rubbery and tasteless as if it had been prepared hours earlier and then reheated. We had intended to start with only 3 tapas since we had already had the soup and told our waiter that we reserved the right to order more. He pressured us into ordering some paella as well so we did. Now I absolutely love paella, it is truly one of my favorite dishes on earth but since other Yelp reviewers had said to stay away from it I ordered it with some misgivings. \n\nThe paella arrived about 20 minutes after we had finished the rest of our meal. Our waiter did warn us that it took a while to prepare but I was not expecting it to take that long. As soon as we tried it, I realized that it was not worth the wait. As other reviewers have mentioned it was way too watery and very bland tasting. In addition, the vegetables tasted like they came from a bag in the freezer section.

I  first remember this place 23 years ago at the corner of 32nd & Camelback - and ate there about 3 times a week back then.  I was heartbroken when they closed.  Then, a version opened at Civic Center, and was ok.  So when I saw this, same name, logo, I assumed somehow same owners or some tie to the place I loved oh so long ago.  Oh how wrong I was..   My first observation was immediately drawn to the one dish representing Asturias, Cabrales and Membrillo.  Please note, it's M-E-M-B-R-I-L-L-O, not m-e-n-b-r-i-l-o (quince paste), so the typo instinctively told me, lack of detail to printing a menu with a typo.  Then the menu my husband had and mine, were not in the same order, so when he was pointing out croquetas, I couldn't find inside, by this time the waitress came by and stated oh, we like to confuse our guest and not organize the menu the same, she had a great sense of humor about it, but again, attention to detail.  I know it sounds super picky, who cares about a typo and order pages are, but again, those first details are a sign of what's to come.   I knew this wasn't an Asturian place, NEVER expected it to be, but FYI, Asturias does have some pretty decent typical (simple) dishes.  World Famous Chef Jose Andres is from Asturias, and he's done incredibly offering alot of cuisine from our province..   So the offering of Cabrales only, well, like I typed, totally biased.   (FYI, I didn't order it, because after you've had Cabrales from the caves of Cabrales, I'm sorry, I'm just not willing to try it anywhere else.)   We ordered the croquetas, cerdo de jamon and boquerones.  We got the croquetas within 5 minutes, so that was a bit disappointing, knowing that even if they were pre rolled/made and all it needed to do was frying, that it would take more than 5 minutes - so I assume that they were pre-cooked at some point.  I didn't know what kind they were, as I didn't find them on the menu, but they were supposed to be ham and cheese.  They had no flavor.  Just fried doughish, with alioli sauce, very bland, very disappointing.  There were 3 on the plate, and I only ate the 1.  Then came the cerdo and boquerones, another 2 mins after we were done with the croquetas.  I immediately touched the sauce with my finger, cause it didn't look hot, and it was lukewarm.  The boquerones were exactly what I expected, canned, oiled boquerones, which, if you've ever been to Galicia, you know some of the best seafood in the world is immediately canned, and a can of seafood can retail for $90.   (oh, I KNOW this wasn't it, but  a $5 can of boquerones is also good).   The pork had been cooked at least a day before - there is no way it was done that morning/day.  It wasn't cooked in the sauce either.  It was dry, almost like a dry pork chop you smother in sauce, but it never absorbed the sauce other than covering it when it was plated.  Besides dry, it was also warm to go with the warm sauce.  Not sure if warm was what they were going for (vs hot), but again, disappointing.  As I stated, boquerones were fine, decent can, so that was the only ok thing.  We were starving, but didn't order anything else but the check to go have lunch else where.  Service was friendly, It was lunch time, about 1 pm on Saturday, 11/12/11.  Sad to say we will never be back.

We were really excited to eat here. \n\nDecor: Gorgeous-the inside is dim and moody with dark wood and tile accents. The patio is very romantic under it's grape-lined pergola and beautiful shade trees.\n\nStarters:  Watermelon ahi ceviche and crab-stuffed piquillo peppers. The watermelon was so crisp and fresh and complemented the ahi nicely.\n\nEntrees: Braised salmon and seafood paella. My salmon was cooked wonderfully with a buttery-lemon sauce and came with a side of safron rice.  We know that \"mixed\" or valenciana paella is a combination of meat and seafood, but we both assumed the \"seafood\" paella, as it's listed on the menu, had just that-seafood. My husband even inquired if it had bacon or anything in it, to which our server informed us it had sausage but that he could get it without. She failed to mention it also had chicken....so we essentially ate our meals separately as he had to wait another 15-20 for a meat-free seafood paella.\n\nDessert: Churros & chocolate, and apple empanada. The churros were crispy and sugary with their delicious melted chocolate, and the apple empanada had a nice flaky crust. \n\nAll the food was really delicious-even the corrected paella turned out to be wonderful. Where this restaurant lost my vote was service. They seemed off point on so many levels. We did have a conscientious busboy who kept us supplied with water, but everyone else: the hostess who didn't smile, our indifferent server, the food runners-no one seemed like they gave a crap.

At one point when our starters came out I was reaching across the table for a piece of bread and the food runner didn't want to wait for me and tried to put my plate down on top of my arm. No joke.

But the most surprising of the night were the grilled brussel sprouts.  WTF?  I don't even like that shit.  But they grilled them with garlic, olive oil and seasoning, and if you do it that way it is ten times better than any veggie a teen would hate.  The Patatas Brava were just ok.  I still ate them, but they were a little more crispy than I care for.\n\nThe setting was impressive.  The dining room is grand, stylish and luxe in its understated way -- so symbolic of Madrid.

The tapas were simply delicious. We had the tortilla espanola, stuffed piquillo pepper, sauteed clams (or were they mussels?) with chorizo, baby back ribs, calamari, manchego cheese/serrano ham/fig.

It might be one of the best things I've ever tried and it was the perfect end to the meal. All told, the food we had (7 dishes) was about $80.

So we decided we'd like to move out on the patio mind you HH was almost over. So the waitress tells us that we would have to close out the bill then move outside where she would be our server again. Huh?? The hub asked what he thought was a manager if it would be a problem he was just a waiter and told us \"Yes that will be a problem\" so after a lot of looking at each other like WTF our waitress finally gets the manager please forgive me I am so bad w names people. He came over and told us we didnt have to move if we wanted that we could order off the HH menu. Thank you! At that time we decided to move outside anyway for the view, they helped move all our stuff over after that dilemma everything went pretty smoothly.\n\nWe continued with the soft lettuce it was really good the almonds were awesome but I cant say anything special about the sauce unfortunately. Next came the calamari def worth trying its a good size portion and worth every penny. The shrimp I will probably pass on next time they were ok not worth 4 for $16 eh I did not think they were that special tasting but they were big. Then there was the piquillo pepper it was stuffed with tuna I was expecting raw tuna or something not canned, it wasn't spicy at all. Think tuna salad but there was capers instead of pickles it wasnt anything special go for something else or I'd suggest it for lunch more than anything. We did not have any dessert nothing really appealed to us on the menu so we just ordered another round of drinks the mojito I had for desert was ok as well.\n\nThis place reminds me of the Scottsdale stereo type where I was not blown away by the food and the normal overpriced drinks I can see this being a neutral watering hole where the cougar and trout come out of their lairs to play simultaneously during the cooler months.

And also: my diet coke came with its own carafe...how cool is that? Definitely an awesome idea.\n\nNow for the bad news: the tapas themselves. We began by asking for our waitress' recommendations on food, and ended up ordering four dishes that she mentioned (five total):\n  -  Tortilla Espanola: This was one that she didn't mention, but some Yelpers did, so we started with what appeared to be potatoes au gratin, minus the cheese, served in the form of deep-dish pie with sour cream drizzled on top. That's the best way I know how to describe it. And it was pretty good, but...very rich. A little more than I was wanting/expecting for my first dish, but this one we actually did end up finishing.\n  -  Calamari with smoked paprika and citrus aioli: I'm an ailoi fan myself, but something about this particular one didn't do it for me...it was just way too citrus-y, I think. I'm pretty sure that we only ended up eating half the bowl - and it wasn't a huge bowl.\n  -  Grilled short ribs with Salbitxada and green onion: short ribs are probably one of my fav dishes of all time, so believe me when I say I've had a few in my lifetime - and these were just not cutting it in any way. I'm willing to admit that this could just be because they were too underdone for my taste, which is, of course, a matter of preference. But even the outer, more done parts didn't have great flavor, and the bizarre stuff underneath wasn't exactly delectable...I took a bite of it, having no clue what it was, and was quite unpleasantly surprised by the flavor/texutre...yikes. We didn't end up finishing this dish, either.\n  -  Seared Alaskan halibut with carrot sauce and dungeness crab salad: All of the components of this dish just sort of...clashed. It's hard to explain, but the weird flavor combo completely overshadowed what was actually pretty decent halibut...how sad.\n  -  Grilled brocolli, caramelized onion sauce, sea salt and olive oil: This was probably the best thing we ordered...pretty good flavor and grilled. Still, not good enough to get again.\n\nNone of the food was spit-it-into-your-napkin-because-you-can't-swallow-it bad (if it was, this place would be getting a heck of a lot fewer stars than 3), but it just...wasn't that good.

Almost everything that comes out of this kitchen is locally grown, hormone and preservative free and FRESH! They even have the fish flown in 6 days a week!\n\nLets start with appetizers... The chips are made in house daily, lightly salted and gluten free! The table side guacamole is super fresh and made to order. All three fundidos are amazing so don't forget to give those a try too! Both the Albondigas and the Tortilla soups are flavorful and heart warming. If your looking for a salad you've come to the right place! The shaved Kale salad is AMAZING!! (yes I am now a believer that kale can be amazing! PS. add chicken) The Haus Chopped has a creamy cilantro dressing that's drinkable it so good! (please don't drink the dressing that would be gross) The Jicama salad surprised me. It was super crisp and refreshing! (make sure to add tuna or shrimp)  \n\nI tried all the empanadas and they all were fantastic... or what the tacotarians call \"pillows of bliss\".

OH yeahhhh! You can mix and match your own little taco stand to please your cravings!! Choose from: Fresh fried fish, mouth watering pork belly, in haus rotisserie chicken, marinated carne asada or local veggies! They all come served on their haus made gluten free tortillas! \n\nThere's two options for how you'd like to go about the main entree portion of dinner. You can go ahead and order your own entree or theres also a section on their menu called \"taquiza\" and those are entree options for two to share! Both sections have amazing options like grilled tuna, scallops, beef or pork tenderloin, flank steak, you can even order a whole rotisserie chicken.

The Halibut was by far my favorite. It melts in your mouth with its buttery taste and texture and kicks you at the end with a citrus note. The Ahi ceviche was my runner up, SUPER FRESH! I'm not a shrimp or scallop person but I went out on a limb and tried them both... The shrimp was light and refreshing and the scallops were herbal and buttery, to both I'd give a thumbs up! All ceviche is served in an avocado.\n\nDesserts --THE TRES LECHES IS TO DIE FOR!!! The flan and homemade chocolate bar are also mouth watering! \n\nOne tequila, two tequila, three tequila... more? Taco Haus has over 36 tequilas, 20+ beers (including big bombers!), an amazing wine list (+ sangria), Haus cocktails that will knock your socks off and duh! tons of awesome margaritas!!!

The kale salad was fresh and delicious. I immediately felt healthier after enjoying this. The guacamole was perfectly flavorful on top of lightly salted, fresh tortilla chips. The empanadas (pillows of bliss as they call them) were heaven and I was happy to learn the dough is gluten free and made in haus. You can't go to a place called taco haus and not order at least one taco, that would be a tragedy! The tacos are \"street size\" which is perfect because then you can order a couple or one of each! My top picks were the carne, pork belly and chicken. We also indulged in some ceviche from the cevicheria. I'm typically skeptical when it comes to ordering seafood in the desert but let me tell you, this fish was fresh! I've never had better ahi and the halibut melted in your mouth. The flavors were phenomenal in both and I'm dying to go back and try the scallop ceviche. Everything tasted so fresh and like it was actually prepared to order not thrown in a science oven (microwave) and tossed on a plate. There was beauty from the quality of food to the presentation to the taste to the way you felt after eating it. Although Mexican is my favorite cuisine, I always feel full and heavy after eating it due to excess cheese, lard, sour cream, etc. At taco haus the food is flavorful and light. Don't forget about the sweet stuff! We took the tres leches cake home and it was literally gone in 15 seconds. I think I'm still upset that we didn't order two. \nThe lesson I hope you will take from this lengthy review is to go to taco haus! Support a wonderful, local business that buys local, fresh ingredients. It makes such a huge difference in flavor and is more nutritious.

We LOVE brat haus so we figured it will be worth the wait.  \nWe ordered a cheese and chorizo dip with chips, we also asked  for a side of salsa\n\nThe rest of the order is 5 carne asada tacos, one fish taco,  one pork belly taco  and (I think) one chicken.\n \nWe also order two beers and a mixed drink I can't identify from  memory right now \n\nwe are brought soup which nobody ordered. we told the lady this was not ours, then we are brought empenadas which we also didn't order we tell her this is not ours either. she takes it.. as if  its our fault we didn't order them. \n\nThen some of our drinks come. We get one of our beers and the mixed drink. The  second beer the guy says \"oh we don't have that, I'm sorry I forgot we were out' \n\n\nFinally our tacos come with the substitute beer, and then our appetizer comes out slightly after.  Fine we ordered them at the same time no big deal..you'd think right?\n\nThe appetizer was supposed to be melted cheese and chorizo. Its stone cold to the point its hard. No chips would pierce this wall cheese. \n\nI'm feeling lucky for some reason so I ordered a second beer as the food was dropped off.\n\nThe  tacos were tasty,  They were good. there is no denying that. Smaller portions than I'd have liked but that's understandable for the price. \n\nThe waiter comes back for that 'how's every thing tasting' check places do, usually it occurs right as you take the first bite of food.. no we had actually finished our tacos  and there were bits chip  sticking out of the concrete cheese.  I told him that was cold and bad  and I'd like the check. \n\nHe comes back. gives us the check and  tries to give us three  free margaritas.  We decline pay and when he brings our card back.. the elusive second beer  shows up.  I assume the beer was locked in a deathmatch with the side of salsa  and only one could emerge to victorious.\n\nOur original plan was to drink quite a few drinks, go see a movie and  then catch a ride home. We spent literally two and a half hours  and paid over $50 to end up buying more drinks at the nearby safeway.. and stopping at jack in the box for snacks and going home. \n\nThis all could have been avoided if the staff knew what  they were doing. \n\nOne other positive thing, the people walking around filling the water glasses were super attentive and and always there.

I'm a HUGE fan of Brat Haus, and was super excited about Taco Haus's grand opening.  We went with a group of friends on opening night for Taco Tuesday.  We arrived in time for happy hour, but when we asked the server what happy hour specials they offered, he wasn't sure.  He double checked, no problem, and we ordered our drinks.  At 6:00, when Taco Tuesday officially started, we asked what the TT specials were.  Again - no clue.  I looked it up on FB and let him know what I found.  We later saw that there was a stack of TT menus at the hostess stand, but they were not shared with us.  Again, not a super big deal.  I ordered the guacamole to start, which was ok but a little bland (needed more salt or something).  The salsa (both green and brown) were amazing.  For dinner, I ordered the scallop ceviche.  I've had ceviche before, and did not remember it being so raw.  Possibly my fault, if that's how it typically comes, and I just didn't know that.  But the scallops were mushy and not at all appetizing, so I took about a bite and left the rest.  Mind you, I'm a sushi fan, so raw in general is not a problem for me, but the raw scallops were probably a bad choice.  I tasted a friend's empanada, and it was quite tasty.  Overall, I left wanting to give it a second chance, knowing it was opening night and they were still probably just working out some kinks.\n\nThe second time, I went for brunch.  I ordered a bloody mary, which was AMAZING.  Honestly, one of the best I've had.  My fianc\u00e9 ordered a margarita.  Before he could specify WHICH margarita (there are several on the menu), the waitress had already hurried off .  No ask on salt or no salt, either.  She ended up bringing him the house margarita - which was not great.  My fianc\u00e9 ordered the breakfast burrito, and seemed pretty happy with it.  I ordered the Cubano sandwich, and was less than impressed.  The ham looked like a slice you would get at the deli counter, not the pork i was imagining for a cuban sandwich. The mustard was little overpowering, and was just your standard yellow mustard.  I feel like I probably could have duplicated that at home.  And the sandwich had no side, which I was kind of hoping for.  We let our server know we were done....and waited.  After about 20+ minutes of trying to track her down and having her race past us (mind you, it was NOT that busy).  she finally came back to our table - and asked if we were done.  We said again that we were, and waited for the bill.  I forgot to mention that we had ordered the guacamole again as a starter.  Same fairly bland taste, but we asked for some salt and that helped.  Then found a hair in my salsa, so the rest sat unfinished.  When the check finally came, I noticed that the waitress had charged me for the guacamole - and also separately for the chips.  I did not pay close attention to my bill the first visit to see if that is common, but I found it weird.  If guacamole is listed as an appetizer, not a side, why WOULDNT it come with chips?  What else would I eat it with?  At this point, we were ready to go, so I let it be.\n\nBoth of these visits were in the first week of opening, and so I am hopeful that they will work out the kinks quickly.

The first time was actually before they opened while they were having a brief 2 hour open house.

Between my husband and I we tried all the tacos (they were offering chicken, carne asada, and lamb).  We were really impressed. Hubby's favorite was the chicken and my favorite was the carne asada.  The lamb was good, but a bit spicy for me (although it doesn't look like it made the menu anyway).  The ceviche was really tasty too.  I found the chips and salsa to be just okay (chips were really thick, and the salsa needed more flavor) and the agua fresca was watered down (they just had it in a large container with ice already in it).  Overall though, we were happy and it was definitely a place we wanted to go back to once they opened.\n\nWe just went back this week for Taco Tuesday.

By far our favorite taco was the pork belly.  It was so good we had to get a second round of just those (note: those are not part of the taco tuesday special, but well worth paying full price).  Unfortunately I was on some medication and couldn't have a margarita, but I'm definitely looking forward to one next time.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because based on some pictures I've seen online (both from the restaurant and from other diners) it seems like their dishes aren't always consistent.

And a charge for chips and salsa? Come on now if you're going to charge for chips and salsa it better be as Robert Irvine puts it the best damn chips and salsa on the planet. They weren't unless you like 2 kinds of mild salsas and thick bland tortilla chips. Tortilla chips are supposed to be fresh light and crunch these were not plus they seems to me to have been in the fryer too long. They were crunchy to say the least but can you say hard? Yes they were very hard. And who charges for chips and salsa these days? Especially bad chips and salsa a cup of Pace and a plate of Mission chips would have been better tasting.  The green and red salsas were at least not loaded with garlic like other places but they had no heat, I love a good hot salsa and this was mediocre at best and mild as can be.\n\nAnd the tacos were what is usually called \"street tacos\" but typical street tacos have two tortillas sandwiched together and these barely had one and they fell apart on me. At the old BBG street tacos came in pairs for less money then what I paid for one. I actually could have gotten a bigger taco for a buck at Taco Bell. Even Jack in the Box tacos are bigger (ok not very good obviously but bigger). But were these tacos worth the price? At $3.25 for one and $2.95 for the other, in a nutshell, no they weren't a very good buy.\n\nI left there with 2 tacos chips and salsa and a beer (ok the West Coast IPA) was good (but not worth $6.00 a pint, I think it was a pint glass) then when I got my bill it was over $16.00 and that was for one person for lunch.

Well it was definitely unique.  It came in a bowl with a line of lightly spiced popcorn.  And it was good...until I bit down on hard popcorn kernels 3 different times.  And that was my limit.  Word to the chef; I would definitely suggest making sure there are no kernels in your popcorn if you're going to season and disguise it on a bed full of seasoned corn.\n2) My dish was so small.  Only two tiny empenadas and that was it. No rice, no lentils, no side salad; nothing else to enjoy with it.  Quite disappointed.  I knew I didn't want anything too heavy to eat, which is why I ordered the veggie empenadas, which were good.

Was really excited because I love modern Mexican cuisine and the menu online really jumped out at me. I work in a restaurant and was excited to try the short rib tacos because I've had some killer ones in the past and the description made me feel like these would be no exception. I ordered the short rib tacos and a side of street corn along with a haus margarita. The margarita was on point and the street corn had unique twists that I haven't encountered in the dish before... Very delicious! However, the tacos themselves were really a let down. The meat was very dry like it had been sitting out rather than bathing in its own juices as any slow cooked meat should. However, with enough extra sriracha aioli to bathe it in I managed to get it down. What I couldn't get past was what was described as 'pickeled peppers' that came on the tacos were nothing more than sliced bell peppers period. As much as I love the decor, ambiance, service and of course the street corn. I hope they fix the execution of this taco.

Someone we knew said it was good, so we thought to give it a try. When we walked into the restaurant, the place was dead, only a few customers. It did not look busy, but all of the tables were filthy. No one greeted us or told us if we could sit ourselves or they'd sit us. We finally found a table and waited for a waitress to wipe it off. She brought over some small plates and flatware, from then on, everything went from BAD to WORSE! \n\n- We found a pill on one of the small plates that the waitress brought out. All she said was \"Oh, I didn't know how the pill got there?\" I jokingly asked \"Is it a marijuana pill or some kind of pill that gets me high?\" She laughed \"possibly!\"\n\n- Then my husband found a bug in his drink. A waiter who was not even waiting on us, apologized and brought the drink back to get my husband a new drink. When my husband told our waitress about the bug, she was arguing with him and said \"it's a normal thing to see bug everywhere and all the time. Espeically in the summer time, if you leave something out, they are going to attract to sweet and food of course.\" Not one apology from her.\n\n- My husband asked for the sweet-n-low sugar and she never brough it, but another waitress did. She was busy yapping with others. Then she pretended to bring them over after already knew another waitress had already helped us.\n\n- The owner / partner of the restaurant named John, came by to check on us and asked how we are doing. He looked very depressed. When we shared with him about the pill and the bug, he brushed it off and said \"people complaint all the time because they want something free.\"\n\nWe walked out with a bill of $56 for ordering 2 combos (3 tiny tacos on each plate, the rest is filled with lentils and rice), an iced tea, a margarita, a small flan, and suck a@@ service. The food wasn't good and small portions. Their dessert is very aweful. I'm very sure I can get better service and quality meals at El Pollo Loco or Taco Bell.
