I'm a Romanian girl who's fairly new to Arizona and when I heard about Europa Pastry Cafe I was totally excited to stop by and purchase cooking ingredients that I wasn't able to find the the local grocery store. The workers seemed very rude and the store was kind of dirty. Also, some of the prepackaged items were expired. I ended up leaving empty handed and very, very disappointed.

Did they move to a new location? Is the owner's okay? I went to their bakery when they were in Chicago many many years ago. I hope everyone in their family is okay. Please let us know. When I stopped by a few weeks ago, I saw that they were closed. Very disappointing. They had the best pastries and cakes, as well as a great deli and all kinds of polish items to buy. Please let us know what happened to Europa's.\n\nThank you.  They are really missed. From a long time customer.\n\nErma", "review_stars": 5, "review_votes": {"funny": 0, "useful": 1, "cool": 0}}], "state": "AZ", "stars": 4.5, "latitude": 33.5318417}]}}
